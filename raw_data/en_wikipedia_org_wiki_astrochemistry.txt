Infographic showing the theorized origin of the [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_elements "Chemical elements") that make up the human body

**Astrochemistry** is the study of the abundance and reactions of [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") in the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"), and their interaction with [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-1) The discipline is an overlap of [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") and [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"). The word "astrochemistry" may be applied to both the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") and the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium"). The study of the abundance of elements and [isotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope") ratios in Solar System objects, such as [meteorites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite "Meteorite"), is also called [cosmochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmochemistry "Cosmochemistry"), while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of [molecular gas clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud "Molecular cloud") is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.

As an offshoot of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry, the history of astrochemistry is founded upon the shared history of the two fields. The development of advanced observational and experimental [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy "Spectroscopy") has allowed for the detection of an [ever-increasing array of molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_interstellar_and_circumstellar_molecules "List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules") within solar systems and the surrounding interstellar medium. In turn, the increasing number of chemicals discovered by advancements in spectroscopy and other technologies have increased the size and scale of the [chemical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_space "Chemical space") available for astrochemical study.

### History of spectroscopy

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astrochemistry&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History of spectroscopy")]

Observations of solar spectra as performed by [Athanasius Kircher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasius_Kircher "Athanasius Kircher") (1646), [Jan Marek Marci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Marek_Marci "Jan Marek Marci") (1648), [Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle "Robert Boyle") (1664), and [Francesco Maria Grimaldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Maria_Grimaldi "Francesco Maria Grimaldi") (1665) all predated Newton's 1666 work which established the [spectral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum") nature of light and resulted in the first [spectroscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_spectrometer "Optical spectrometer").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-2) Spectroscopy was first used as an astronomical technique in 1802 with the experiments of [William Hyde Wollaston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hyde_Wollaston "William Hyde Wollaston"), who built a spectrometer to observe the spectral lines present within solar radiation.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-Timeline_Site-3) These spectral lines were later quantified through the work of [Joseph von Fraunhofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Von_Fraunhofer "Joseph Von Fraunhofer").

Spectroscopy was first used to distinguish between different materials after the release of [Charles Wheatstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone "Charles Wheatstone")'s 1835 report that the [sparks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_emission_spectroscopy "Atomic emission spectroscopy") given off by different metals have distinct emission spectra.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-4) This observation was later built upon by [Léon Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Foucault "Léon Foucault"), who demonstrated in 1849 that identical [absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation) "Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)") and [emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_(electromagnetic_radiation) "Emission (electromagnetic radiation)") lines result from the same material at different temperatures. An equivalent statement was independently postulated by [Anders Jonas Ångström](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Jonas_%C3%85ngstr%C3%B6m "Anders Jonas Ångström") in his 1853 work _Optiska Undersökningar,_ where it was theorized that luminous gases emit rays of light at the same frequencies as light which they may absorb.

This spectroscopic data began to take upon theoretical importance with Johann Balmer's observation that the spectral lines exhibited by samples of hydrogen followed a simple empirical relationship which came to be known as the [Balmer Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmer_Series "Balmer Series"). This series, a special case of the more general [Rydberg Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydberg_formula "Rydberg formula") developed by [Johannes Rydberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Rydberg "Johannes Rydberg") in 1888, was created to describe the spectral lines observed for [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen"). Rydberg's work expanded upon this formula by allowing for the calculation of spectral lines for multiple different chemical elements.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-5) The theoretical importance granted to these spectroscopic results was greatly expanded upon the development of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), as the theory allowed for these results to be compared to atomic and molecular emission spectra which had been calculated _a priori_.

### History of astrochemistry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astrochemistry&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: History of astrochemistry")]

While [radio astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy "Radio astronomy") was developed in the 1930s, it was not until 1937 that any substantial evidence arose for the conclusive identification of an interstellar _molecule_[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-6) – up until this point, the only chemical species known to exist in interstellar space were atomic. These findings were confirmed in 1940, when McKellar _et al_. identified and attributed spectroscopic lines in an as-of-then unidentified radio observation to CH and CN molecules in interstellar space.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-7) In the thirty years afterwards, a small selection of other molecules were discovered in interstellar space: the most important being OH, discovered in 1963 and significant as a source of interstellar oxygen,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-8) and H 2 CO ([formaldehyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde "Formaldehyde")), discovered in 1969 and significant for being the first observed organic, polyatomic molecule in interstellar space[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-9)

The discovery of interstellar formaldehyde – and later, other molecules with potential biological significance, such as water or [carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide") – is seen by some as strong supporting evidence for [abiogenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis "Abiogenesis") theories of life: specifically, theories which hold that the basic molecular components of life came from extraterrestrial sources. This has prompted a still ongoing search for interstellar molecules which are either of direct biological importance – such as interstellar [glycine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine "Glycine"), discovered in a comet within the Solar System in 2009[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-Glycine_Discovery_Announcement-10) – or which exhibit biologically relevant properties like [chirality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality "Chirality") – an example of which ([propylene oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylene_oxide "Propylene oxide")) was discovered in 2016[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-11) – alongside more basic astrochemical research.

One particularly important experimental tool in astrochemistry is [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy "Spectroscopy") through the use of [telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope") to measure the absorption and emission of [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") from molecules and atoms in various environments. By comparing astronomical observations with laboratory measurements, astrochemists can infer the elemental abundances, chemical composition, and temperatures of stars and [interstellar clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_cloud "Interstellar cloud"). This is possible because [ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion"), [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom"), and molecules have characteristic spectra: that is, the absorption and emission of certain wavelengths (colors) of light, often not visible to the human eye. However, these measurements have limitations, with various types of radiation ([radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_waves "Radio waves"), [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_radiation "Infrared radiation"), visible, [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_radiation "Ultraviolet radiation") etc.) able to detect only certain types of species, depending on the chemical properties of the molecules. [Interstellar formaldehyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_formaldehyde "Interstellar formaldehyde") was the first [organic molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_molecule "Organic molecule") detected in the interstellar medium.

Perhaps the most powerful technique for detection of individual [chemical species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_species "Chemical species") is [radio astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy "Radio astronomy"), which has resulted in the detection of over a hundred [interstellar species](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interstellar_species&action=edit&redlink=1 "Interstellar species (page does not exist)"), including [radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry) "Radical (chemistry)") and ions, and [organic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compounds "Organic compounds") (i.e. [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon")-based) compounds, such as [alcohols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(chemistry) "Alcohol (chemistry)"), [acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid "Acid"), [aldehydes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde "Aldehyde"), and [ketones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketone "Ketone"). One of the most abundant interstellar molecules, and among the easiest to detect with radio waves (due to its strong electric [dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole "Dipole") moment), is CO ([carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide")). In fact, CO is such a common interstellar molecule that it is used to map out molecular regions.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-12) The radio observation of perhaps greatest human interest is the claim of interstellar [glycine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine "Glycine"),[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-Kuan-13) the simplest [amino acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid "Amino acid"), but with considerable accompanying controversy.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-Snyder-14) One of the reasons why this detection was controversial is that although radio (and some other methods like [rotational spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_spectroscopy "Rotational spectroscopy")) are good for the identification of simple species with large [dipole moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_dipole_moment "Bond dipole moment"), they are less sensitive to more complex molecules, even something relatively small like amino acids.

Moreover, such methods are completely blind to molecules that have no [dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole "Dipole"). For example, by far the most common molecule in the universe is H 2 ([hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") gas, or chemically better said [dihydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen "Dihydrogen")), but it does not have a dipole moment, so it is invisible to radio telescopes. Moreover, such methods cannot detect species that are not in the gas-phase. Since dense molecular clouds are very cold (10 to 50 K [−263.1 to −223.2°C; −441.7 to −369.7°F]), most molecules in them (other than dihydrogen) are frozen, i.e. solid. Instead, dihydrogen and these other molecules are detected using other wavelengths of light. Dihydrogen is easily detected in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible ranges from its absorption and emission of light (the [hydrogen line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line "Hydrogen line")). Moreover, most organic compounds absorb and emit light in the infrared (IR) so, for example, the detection of [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane") in the atmosphere of Mars[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-Mumma-15) was achieved using an IR ground-based telescope, NASA's 3-meter [Infrared Telescope Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_Telescope_Facility "Infrared Telescope Facility") atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii. NASA's researchers use airborne IR telescope [SOFIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOFIA "SOFIA") and space telescope [Spitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope "Spitzer Space Telescope") for their observations, researches and scientific operations.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-17) Somewhat related to the recent detection of [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane") in the [atmosphere of Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mars "Atmosphere of Mars"). Christopher Oze, of the [University of Canterbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Canterbury "University of Canterbury") in [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand") and his colleagues reported, in June 2012, that measuring the ratio of dihydrogen and methane levels on Mars may help determine the likelihood of [life on Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars_(planet) "Life on Mars (planet)").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-PNAS-20120607-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-Space-20120625-19) According to the scientists, "...low H 2/CH 4 ratios (less than approximately 40) indicate that life is likely present and active."[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-PNAS-20120607-18) Other scientists have recently reported methods of detecting dihydrogen and methane in [extraterrestrial atmospheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_atmospheres "Extraterrestrial atmospheres").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-Nature-20120627-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-Wired-20120627-21)

Infrared astronomy has also revealed that the interstellar medium contains a suite of complex gas-phase carbon compounds called [polyaromatic hydrocarbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon"), often abbreviated PAHs or PACs. These molecules, composed primarily of fused rings of carbon (either neutral or in an ionized state), are said to be the most common class of carbon compound in the [Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way"). They are also the most common class of carbon molecule in meteorites and in cometary and asteroidal dust ([cosmic dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust "Cosmic dust")). These compounds, as well as the amino acids, [nucleobases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleobase "Nucleobase"), and many other compounds in meteorites, carry [deuterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium "Deuterium") and [isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope") of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen that are very rare on Earth, attesting to their extraterrestrial origin. The PAHs are thought to form in hot circumstellar environments (around dying, carbon-rich [red giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant "Red giant") stars).

Infrared astronomy has also been used to assess the composition of solid materials in the interstellar medium, including [silicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate "Silicate"), [kerogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerogen "Kerogen")-like carbon-rich solids, and [ices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice"). This is because unlike visible light, which is scattered or absorbed by solid particles, the IR radiation can pass through the microscopic interstellar particles, but in the process there are absorptions at certain wavelengths that are characteristic of the composition of the grains.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-astrochem-22) As above with radio astronomy, there are certain limitations, e.g. N 2 is difficult to detect by either IR or radio astronomy.

Such IR observations have determined that in dense clouds (where there are enough particles to attenuate the destructive UV radiation) thin ice layers coat the microscopic particles, permitting some low-temperature chemistry to occur. Since dihydrogen is by far the most abundant molecule in the universe, the initial chemistry of these ices is determined by the chemistry of the hydrogen. If the hydrogen is atomic, then the H atoms react with available O, C and N atoms, producing "reduced" species like H 2 O, CH 4, and NH 3. However, if the hydrogen is molecular and thus not reactive, this permits the heavier atoms to react or remain bonded together, producing CO, CO 2, CN, etc. These mixed-molecular ices are exposed to ultraviolet radiation and [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray"), which results in complex radiation-driven chemistry.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-astrochem-22) Lab experiments on the photochemistry of simple interstellar ices have produced amino acids.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-23) The similarity between interstellar and cometary ices (as well as comparisons of gas phase compounds) have been invoked as indicators of a connection between interstellar and cometary chemistry. This is somewhat supported by the results of the analysis of the organics from the comet samples returned by the [Stardust mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_(spacecraft) "Stardust (spacecraft)") but the minerals also indicated a surprising contribution from high-temperature chemistry in the solar nebula.

Transition from atomic to molecular gas at the border of the [Orion molecular cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Molecular_Clouds "Orion Molecular Clouds")[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-24)

Research is progressing on the way in which interstellar and circumstellar molecules form and interact, e.g. by including non-trivial [quantum mechanical phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling#Astrochemistry_in_interstellar_clouds "Quantum tunnelling") for synthesis pathways on interstellar particles.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-25) This research could have a profound impact on our understanding of the suite of molecules that were present in the molecular cloud when the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") formed, which contributed to the rich carbon chemistry of comets and asteroids and hence the meteorites and interstellar dust particles which fall to the Earth by the ton every day.

The sparseness of interstellar and interplanetary space results in some unusual chemistry, since [symmetry-forbidden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodward%E2%80%93Hoffmann_rules "Woodward–Hoffmann rules") reactions cannot occur except on the longest of timescales. For this reason, molecules and molecular ions which are unstable on Earth can be highly abundant in space, for example the [H 3+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protonated_molecular_hydrogen "Protonated molecular hydrogen") ion.

Astrochemistry overlaps with [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics") and [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics") in characterizing the nuclear reactions which occur in stars, as well as the structure of stellar interiors. If a star develops a largely convective envelope, [dredge-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredge-up "Dredge-up") events can occur, bringing the products of nuclear burning to the surface. If the star is experiencing significant mass loss, the expelled material may contain molecules whose rotational and vibrational spectral transitions can be observed with radio and infrared telescopes. An interesting example of this is the set of carbon stars with silicate and water-ice outer envelopes. Molecular spectroscopy allows us to see these stars transitioning from an original composition in which oxygen was more abundant than carbon, to a [carbon star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_star "Carbon star") phase where the carbon produced by helium burning is brought to the surface by deep convection, and dramatically changes the molecular content of the stellar wind.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-waller-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-suh-27)

In October 2011, scientists reported that [cosmic dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust "Cosmic dust") contains [organic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound "Organic compound") matter ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed [aromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic "Aromatic")-[aliphatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliphatic "Aliphatic") structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-Space-20111026-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-ScienceDaily-20111026-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-Nature-20111026-30)

On August 29, 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at [Copenhagen University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_University "Copenhagen University") reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [glycolaldehyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolaldehyde "Glycolaldehyde"), in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the [protostellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar "Protostar") binary _IRAS 16293-2422_, which is located 400 light years from Earth.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-NG-20120829-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-AP-20120829-32) Glycolaldehyde is needed to form [ribonucleic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribonucleic_acid "Ribonucleic acid"), or [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA "RNA"), which is similar in function to [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA"). This finding suggests that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-33)

In September, 2012, [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") scientists reported that [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons"), subjected to [interstellar medium (ISM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium") conditions, are transformed, through [hydrogenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenation "Hydrogenation"), [oxygenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenate "Oxygenate") and [hydroxylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylation "Hydroxylation"), to more complex [organics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound "Organic compound") – "a step along the path toward [amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acids "Amino acids") and [nucleotides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotides "Nucleotides"), the raw materials of [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteins "Proteins") and [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA"), respectively".[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-Space-20120920-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-AJL-20120901-35) Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in [interstellar ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_ice "Interstellar ice")[grains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust#Dust_grain_formation "Cosmic dust"), particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [protoplanetary disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disks "Protoplanetary disks")."[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-Space-20120920-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-AJL-20120901-35)

In February 2014, [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") announced the creation of an improved spectral database [[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-36) for tracking [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons") (PAHs) in the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"). According to scientists, more than 20% of the [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon") in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible [starting materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAH_world_hypothesis "PAH world hypothesis") for the [formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis#PAH_world_hypothesis "Abiogenesis") of [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life#Extraterrestrial "Life"). PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang"), are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with [new stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation "Star formation") and [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanets "Exoplanets").[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-NASA-20140221-37)

On August 11, 2014, astronomers released studies, using the [Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array "Atacama Large Millimeter Array") for the first time, that detailed the distribution of [HCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide "Hydrogen cyanide"), [HNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_isocyanide "Hydrogen isocyanide"), [H 2 CO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde "Formaldehyde"), and [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust "Dust") inside the [comae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_(cometary) "Coma (cometary)") of [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet")[C/2012 F6 (Lemmon)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2012_F6_(Lemmon) "C/2012 F6 (Lemmon)") and [C/2012 S1 (ISON)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_ISON "Comet ISON").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-NASA-20140811-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-AJL-20140811-39)

For the study of the recourses of chemical elements and molecules in the universe is developed the mathematical model of the molecules composition distribution in the interstellar environment on thermodynamic potentials by professor M.Yu. Dolomatov using methods of the probability theory, the mathematical and physical statistics and the equilibrium thermodynamics.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-abundance_of_chemical_elements-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-abundance_of_chemical_elements2-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-abundance_of_chemical_elements3-42) Based on this model are estimated the resources of life-related molecules, amino acids and the nitrogenous bases in the interstellar medium. The possibility of the oil hydrocarbons molecules formation is shown. The given calculations confirm Sokolov's and Hoyl's hypotheses about the possibility of the oil hydrocarbons formation in Space. Results are confirmed by data of astrophysical supervision and space researches.

In July 2015, scientists reported that upon the first touchdown of the _[Philae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philae\_(spacecraft) "Philae (spacecraft)")_ lander on [comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet")[67/P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67/P "67/P")'s surface, measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments revealed sixteen organic compounds, four of which were seen for the first time on a comet, including [acetamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetamide "Acetamide"), [acetone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone "Acetone"), [methyl isocyanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_isocyanate "Methyl isocyanate") and [propionaldehyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propionaldehyde "Propionaldehyde").[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-wapo20150730-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-esa20150730-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-SCI-20150731-45)

In December 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in the [plumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plume_(fluid_dynamics) "Plume (fluid dynamics)") of [Enceladus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus "Enceladus"), moon of the planet [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn "Saturn"), of [hydrogen cyanide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide "Hydrogen cyanide"), a possible chemical essential for [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life")[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-ATL-20231205-46) as we know it, as well as other [organic molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_molecule "Organic molecule"), some of which are yet to be better identified and understood. According to the researchers, "these [newly discovered] compounds could potentially support extant [microbial communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism "Microorganism") or drive complex [organic synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_synthesis "Organic synthesis") leading to the [origin of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_life "Origin of life")."[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-NYT-20231214kc-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry#cite_note-NA-20231214-48)
