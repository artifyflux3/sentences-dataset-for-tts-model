( January 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In analytic geometry , the direction cosines (or directional cosines ) of a vector are the cosines of the angles between the vector and the three positive coordinate axes. Equivalently, they are the contributions of each component of the basis to a unit vector in that direction .

Three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates [ edit ] Vector v in ⁠ R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} ⁠ Direction cosines and direction angles for the unit vector v | v | {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\mathbf {v} }{|\mathbf {v} |}}} Further information: Cartesian coordinates If v is a Euclidean vector in three-dimensional Euclidean space , ⁠ R 3 , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3},} ⁠ v = v x e x + v y e y + v z e z , {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =v_{x}\mathbf {e} _{x}+v_{y}\mathbf {e} _{y}+v_{z}\mathbf {e} _{z},} where e x , e y , e z are the standard basis in Cartesian notation, then the direction cosines are α α = cos ⁡ ⁡ a = v ⋅ ⋅ e x ‖ ‖ v ‖ ‖ = v x v x 2 + v y 2 + v z 2 , β β = cos ⁡ ⁡ b = v ⋅ ⋅ e y ‖ ‖ v ‖ ‖ = v y v x 2 + v y 2 + v z 2 , γ γ = cos ⁡ ⁡ c = v ⋅ ⋅ e z ‖ ‖ v ‖ ‖ = v z v x 2 + v y 2 + v z 2 .

{\displaystyle {\begin{alignedat}{2}\alpha &{}=\cos a={\frac {\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {e} _{x}}{\Vert \mathbf {v} \Vert }}&&{}={\frac {v_{x}}{\sqrt {v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}}}},\\\beta &{}=\cos b={\frac {\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {e} _{y}}{\Vert \mathbf {v} \Vert }}&&{}={\frac {v_{y}}{\sqrt {v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}}}},\\\gamma &{}=\cos c={\frac {\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {e} _{z}}{\Vert \mathbf {v} \Vert }}&&{}={\frac {v_{z}}{\sqrt {v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}}}}.\end{alignedat}}} It follows that by squaring each equation and adding the results cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ a + cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ b + cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ c = α α 2 + β β 2 + γ γ 2 = 1.

{\displaystyle \cos ^{2}a+\cos ^{2}b+\cos ^{2}c=\alpha ^{2}+\beta ^{2}+\gamma ^{2}=1.} Here α , β , γ are the direction cosines and the Cartesian coordinates of the unit vector v | v | , {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\mathbf {v} }{|\mathbf {v} |}},} and a , b , c are the direction angles of the vector v .

The direction angles a , b , c are acute or obtuse angles , i.e., 0 ≤ a ≤ π , 0 ≤ b ≤ π and 0 ≤ c ≤ π , and they denote the angles formed between v and the unit basis vectors e x , e y , e z .

General meaning [ edit ] More generally, direction cosine refers to the cosine of the angle between any two vectors . They are useful for forming direction cosine matrices that express one set of orthonormal basis vectors in terms of another set, or for expressing a known vector in a different basis. Simply put, direction cosines provide an easy method of representing the direction of a vector in a Cartesian coordinate system.

Applications [ edit ] Determining angles between two vectors [ edit ] If vectors u and v have direction cosines ( α u , β u , γ u ) and ( α v , β v , γ v ) respectively, with an angle θ between them, their units vectors are u ^ ^ = 1 u x 2 + u y 2 + u z 2 ( u x e x + u y e y + u z e z ) = α α u e x + β β u e y + γ γ u e z v ^ ^ = 1 v x 2 + v y 2 + v z 2 ( v x e x + v y e y + v z e z ) = α α v e x + β β v e y + γ γ v e z .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {\hat {u}} &={\frac {1}{\sqrt {u_{x}^{2}+u_{y}^{2}+u_{z}^{2}}}}\left(u_{x}\mathbf {e} _{x}+u_{y}\mathbf {e} _{y}+u_{z}\mathbf {e} _{z}\right)=\alpha _{u}\mathbf {e} _{x}+\beta _{u}\mathbf {e} _{y}+\gamma _{u}\mathbf {e} _{z}\\\mathbf {\hat {v}} &={\frac {1}{\sqrt {v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}}}}\left(v_{x}\mathbf {e} _{x}+v_{y}\mathbf {e} _{y}+v_{z}\mathbf {e} _{z}\right)=\alpha _{v}\mathbf {e} _{x}+\beta _{v}\mathbf {e} _{y}+\gamma _{v}\mathbf {e} _{z}.\end{aligned}}} Taking the dot product of these two unit vectors yield, u ^ ^ ⋅ ⋅ v ^ ^ = α α u α α v + β β u β β v + γ γ u γ γ v = cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ , {\displaystyle \mathbf {{\hat {u}}\cdot {\hat {v}}} =\alpha _{u}\alpha _{v}+\beta _{u}\beta _{v}+\gamma _{u}\gamma _{v}=\cos \theta ,} where θ is the angle between the two unit vectors, and is also the angle between u and v .

Since θ is a geometric angle, and is never negative. Therefore only the positive value of the dot product is taken, yielding us the final result, θ θ = arccos ⁡ ⁡ ( α α u α α v + β β u β β v + γ γ u γ γ v ) .

{\displaystyle \theta =\arccos \left(\alpha _{u}\alpha _{v}+\beta _{u}\beta _{v}+\gamma _{u}\gamma _{v}\right).} See also [ edit ] Cartesian tensor Euler angles References [ edit ] Kay, D. C. (1988).
