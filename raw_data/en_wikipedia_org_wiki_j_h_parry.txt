For his war service, he was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1942.

Academic career [ edit ] Upon demobilization, Parry returned to Clare College, Cambridge , where he was tutor in history 1945–1949. He served additionally as senior proctor, 1947–48 and university lecturer in history, 1946–1949.
