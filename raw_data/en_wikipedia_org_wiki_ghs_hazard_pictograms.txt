Two sets of pictograms are included within the GHS: one for the labelling of containers and for workplace hazard warnings, and a second for use during the transport of dangerous goods. Either one or the other is chosen, depending on the target audience, but the two are not used together for the same hazard.

[ 1 ] The two sets of pictograms use the same symbols for the same hazards, although certain symbols are not required for transport pictograms. Transport pictograms come in a wider variety of colors and may contain additional information such as a subcategory number.

Hazard pictograms are one of the key elements for the labelling of containers under the GHS, along with: [ 2 ] an identification of the product; a signal word – either Danger or Warning – where necessary hazard statements , indicating the nature and degree of the risks posed by the product precautionary statements , indicating how the product should be handled to minimize risks to the user (as well as to other people and the general environment) the identity of the supplier (who might be a manufacturer or importer) The GHS chemical hazard pictograms are intended to provide the basis for or to replace national systems of hazard pictograms. It has still to be implemented by the European Union ( CLP regulation ) in 2009.

The GHS transport pictograms are the same as those recommended in the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods , widely implemented in national regulations such as the U.S.

Federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 5101–5128) and D.O.T. regulations at 49 C.F.R. 100–185.

manganese heptoxide ( fire diamond rating at health hazard is 4) GHS06: Toxic Acute toxicity (oral, dermal, inhalation), category 4 Skin irritation, categories 2, 3 Eye irritation, category 2A Skin sensitization, category 1 Specific target organ toxicity following single exposure, category 3 Respiratory tract irritation Narcotic effects Not used [ 3 ] with the "skull and crossbones" pictogram for skin or eye irritation if: the "corrosion" pictogram also appears the "health hazard" pictogram is used to indicate respiratory sensitization GHS07: Health Hazard/Hazardous to Ozone Layer Respiratory sensitization, category 1 Germ cell mutagenicity, categories 1A, 1B, 2 Carcinogenicity, categories 1A, 1B, 2 Reproductive toxicity, categories 1A, 1B, 2 Specific target organ toxicity following single exposure, categories 1, 2 Specific target organ toxicity following repeated exposure, categories 1, 2 Aspiration hazard, categories 1, 2 e.g.

Alternative sign Division 2.1 Non-flammable non-toxic gases – Gases which: are asphyxiant – gases which dilute or replace the oxygen normally in the atmosphere; or are oxidizing – gases which may, generally by providing oxygen, cause or contribute to the combustion of other material more than air does; or do not come under the other divisions.

Alternative sign Division 2.2 Toxic gases – Gases which: are known to be so toxic or corrosive to humans as to pose a hazard to health; or are presumed to be toxic or corrosive to humans because they have an LC 50 value equal to or less than 5000 ml/m 3 (ppm).

e.g.

hydrogen cyanide Division 2.3 Classes 3 and 4: Flammable liquids and solids [ edit ] Pictogram Usage Flammable liquids – Liquids which have a flash point of less than 60 °C and which are capable of sustaining combustion e.g.

acetone Alternative sign Class 3 Flammable solids, self-reactive substances and solid desensitized explosives – Solids which, under conditions encountered in transport, are readily combustible or may cause or contribute to fire through friction; self-reactive substances which are liable to undergo a strongly exothermic reaction; solid desensitized explosives which may explode if not diluted sufficiently Division 4.1 Substances liable to spontaneous combustion – Substances which are liable to spontaneous heating under normal conditions encountered in transport, or to heating up in contact with air, and being then liable to catch fire e.g.
