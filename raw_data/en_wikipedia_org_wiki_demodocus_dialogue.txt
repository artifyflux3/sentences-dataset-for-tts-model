The dialogue is extant and was included in the Stephanus edition published in Geneva in 1578. It is now generally acknowledged to be a fabrication by a late sophist or rhetorician , probably later than mid-fourth century BC.

[ 1 ] It appears to be a combination of two separate works. The first part is a monologue (addressed to Demodocus), which argues against collective decision-making. There then follows a trilogy of dialogues (with anonymous participants) which raise three elements of doubt against common sense .
