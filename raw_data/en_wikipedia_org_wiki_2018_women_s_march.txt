They strive to break down the system of oppression with the means of nonviolent action led by morality and reverence.

New York City, New York San Francisco , California Washington, D.C.

Morristown, N.J.

El Paso, Texas Miami, Florida Baltimore, Maryland Stories [ edit ] Sexual assault advocacy [ edit ] On January 20, 2018, in New York City, Halsey delivered a speech to thousands of protesters at the second annual Women's March.

[ 38 ] The Me Too and Time's Up movements have pushed progressive activists, including celebrities, to demand immediate social and political change.

[ 39 ] Instead of a traditional speech, Halsey performed a five-minute poem titled A Story Like Mine , in which she talked about sexual assault and violence she and others had experienced.

[ 38 ] Her personal narrative included accompanying her best friend to Planned Parenthood after she had been raped, her personal account of sexual assault by neighbors and boyfriends, and women sexually assaulted by Olympic doctor Larry Nassar .

[ 40 ] Halsey further expressed her belief that celebrities are more probably to be heard and recognized as legitimately significant in media systems and that they have the power to connect popular culture to political culture, stating, "Listen, and then yell at the top of your lungs, be a voice for all those who have prisoner tongues." [ 41 ] [ 40 ] Halsey's speech, along with others, were intended to prompt women to reflect and debate misogynistic and patriarchal societal values. Halsey read, "What do you mean this happened to me? You can't put your hands on me. You don't know what my body has been through. I'm supposed to be safe now. I've earned it." [ 42 ] [ 40 ] Halsey said, "Every friend I know has a story like mine." [ 41 ] Halsey completed her speech by requesting all—"Black, Asian, poor, wealthy, trans, cis, Muslim, Christian"—sexual assault victims to listen and support each other.

[ 40 ] Pussyhats [ edit ] For the 2018 Women's March, some organizers discouraged people from wearing pussyhats because they believed "the pink pussyhat excludes and is offensive to transgender women and gender nonbinary people who don't have typical female genitalia and to women of color because their genitals are more likely to be brown than pink".

[ 43 ] The name actually refers to the resemblance of the top corners of the hats to cat ears and attempts to reclaim the derogatory term " pussy ", a play on Donald Trump 's widely reported 2005 remarks that women would let him "grab them by the pussy".

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] See also [ edit ] Woman Suffrage Procession , a 1913 demonstration in Washington, D.C., led by Alice Paul , to rally for suffrage Million Woman March , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 25, 1997 Women's March (South Africa) , to protest the introduction of the Apartheid pass laws in Pretoria, August 9, 1956 List of protest marches on Washington, D.C.

Notes [ edit ] ^ The Palestinian American Women's Association (PAWA) withdrew from the Los Angeles march because Scarlett Johansson was a featured speaker. The PAWA criticize Johansson's role as "first global brand ambassador" for the Israeli company SodaStream . She was featured in their television commercial during the February 2014 Super Bowl XLVIII .

[ 17 ] SodaStream is one of the Israeli companies targeted by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, [ 18 ] launched in 2005 to pressure Israel to end the occupation . SodaStream operates its primary plant in Mishor Adumim on contested land.
