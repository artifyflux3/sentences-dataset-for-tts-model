2016) ​ Children Kwan: 1 Daniel Kwan (born February 10, 1988) [ 1 ] and Daniel Scheinert (born June 7, 1987), [ 2 ] known collectively as the Daniels , are an American filmmaking duo. They began their career as directors of music videos, [ 3 ] including ones for " Houdini " (2012) by Foster the People and " Turn Down for What " (2013) by DJ Snake and Lil Jon , both of which earned them Grammy Award nominations.

They wrote and directed the absurdist comedy-dramas Swiss Army Man (2016) and Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022). The latter became A24 's highest-grossing film, [ 4 ] and won the duo many awards, including Academy Awards for Best Picture , Best Director , and Best Original Screenplay .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Careers [ edit ] Music videos [ edit ] Kwan and Scheinert met while studying film at Emerson College in Boston .

[ 8 ] Kwan graduated in 2010 and Scheinert graduated in 2009.

[ 9 ] They went to college with Sunita Mani , who starred with Kwan in the music video for " Turn Down for What ", [ 10 ] which they directed.

[ 11 ] Since 2011, the duo have directed music videos for artists including Foster the People , the Shins and Tenacious D . In 2018, Kwan co-founded the group We Direct Music Videos (W.D.M.V.), described as "a global community of music video directors who are committed to sustainable directorial labor practices".

[ 12 ] Transition to film and television [ edit ] In 2016, the duo expanded to feature films, writing and directing Swiss Army Man , starring Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe , [ 13 ] which received positive reviews, [ 14 ] as well as the duo winning the Directing Award at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival .

[ 15 ] In 2019, Scheinert directed the black comedy - drama film The Death of Dick Long , which premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival and received positive reviews.

The Daniels have since accumulated several television directing credits, including Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens , Legion (Kwan only) and On Becoming a God in Central Florida (Scheinert only). The duo were attached as directors on a prospective TV adaption of Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut , being developed by Noah Hawley , but the project was not picked up.

[ 16 ] Everything Everywhere All at Once [ edit ] The Daniels announced in 2017 they would write, direct, and produce a science-fiction film with their producing partner Jonathan Wang and the Russo brothers .

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Everything Everywhere All at Once , starring Michelle Yeoh , Stephanie Hsu , Ke Huy Quan , James Hong and Jamie Lee Curtis , was released in March 2022 to widespread critical acclaim and box office success, garnering several awards and accolades for the duo including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Director at the 95th Academy Awards .

[ 19 ] The film received 11 Academy Award nominations, more than any other film that year, and won seven. Prior to the Oscars ceremony, IGN calculated that Everything Everywhere All at Once had surpassed The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) as the most awarded film of all time.

[ 20 ] Upcoming projects [ edit ] As of 2022 [update] , the Daniels have signed a first look TV deal with A24 .

[ 21 ] The same year, they also signed a five-year film deal with Universal Pictures .

[ 22 ] The duo were on the Time 100 Next list in 2022.

[ 23 ] In March 2023, it was revealed that the Daniels had directed one episode of Star Wars: Skeleton Crew (2024).

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] In February 2024, it was announced that the Daniels' next feature film was scheduled to release on June 12, 2026. The following year it was announced that the film had been delayed to an unspecified date after Universal Pictures confirmed that a new film by Steven Spielberg would release on that date.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] In June 2025, it was announced that Paul Dano would write and potentially direct and produce "a high-concept comedy" for Universal Pictures , produced by the Daniels.

[ 28 ] Personal lives [ edit ] Kwan was born in Westborough, Massachusetts , to a Taiwanese mother and a father from Hong Kong . He has been married to fellow filmmaker and animator Kirsten Lepore since 2016, and together they have one son.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Kwan was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after researching the condition for Everything Everywhere All At Once .

[ 31 ] Scheinert was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama , the son of Becky and Ken Scheinert.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] He attended Oak Mountain Elementary and Middle School, and was a student at the advanced magnet program Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School at the campus of Shades Valley High School .

[ 32 ] In 2023, the Daniels won the Emerson College EVVY Alumni Award of Distinction.
