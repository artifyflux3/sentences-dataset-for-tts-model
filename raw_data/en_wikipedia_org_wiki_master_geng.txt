c.

975 ) was a Chinese alchemist , [ 1 ] and the daughter of Geng Qian.

[ 2 ] Legend says that during her adolescence, she already demonstrated her intelligence, curiosity, and developed skills in the alchemical arts.

[ 3 ] Eventually, her skills drew the attention of  emperor Xuanzong , who invited her to the palace.

[ 1 ] Within the palace, rather than being counted as one of the palace women, she was honoured as a scholar, and given the title Master (or Teacher).

[ 2 ] Whenever she had an audience, she spoke confidently and eloquently, always wearing green robes.

[ 3 ] She is described as performing alchemical transformations, as well as dabbling in divination.

[ 3 ] Most of her alchemy focused on creating silver, and tales tell of her ability to use mercury to turn even snow into silver.

[ 4 ] This, some modern chemists have proposed, might be an example of a legitimate chemical process in which mercury is used to extract silver from ores.

[ 1 ] She may have also distilled perfumes, and utilized an early form of the Soxhlet process to extract camphor into alcohol.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] In her personal life, Geng was noted as enjoying wine, and romantic and sexual dalliances.
