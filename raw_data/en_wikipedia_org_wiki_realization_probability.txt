The random variable itself is the process dictating how the observation comes about. Statistical quantities computed from realizations without deploying a statistical model are often called " empirical ", as in empirical distribution function or empirical probability .

Conventionally, to avoid confusion, upper case letters denote random variables; the corresponding lower case letters denote their realizations.

[ 1 ] Formal definition [ edit ] In more formal probability theory , a random variable is a function X defined from a sample space Ω to a measurable space called the state space .

[ 2 ] [ a ] If an element in Ω is mapped to an element in state space by X , then that element in state space is a realization. Elements of the sample space can be thought of as all the different possibilities that could happen; while a realization (an element of the state space) can be thought of as the value X attains when one of the possibilities did happen.

Probability is a mapping that assigns numbers between zero and one to certain subsets of the sample space, namely the measurable subsets, known here as events . Subsets of the sample space that contain only one element are called elementary events . The value of the random variable (that is, the function) X at a point ω ∈ Ω, x = X ( ω ω ) {\displaystyle x=X(\omega )} is called a realization of X .
