This article is about the concept of current time. For a gift, see [Gift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift "Gift"). For other uses, see [Present (disambiguation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_(disambiguation) "Present (disambiguation)").

The **present** is the period of [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") that is occurring now. The present is contrasted with the [past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past "Past"), the period of time that has already occurred; and the [future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future "Future"), the period of time that has yet to occur.

It is sometimes represented as a [hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane") in [space-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-time "Space-time"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-1) typically called "now", although modern physics demonstrates that such a hyperplane cannot be defined uniquely for observers in relative motion. The present may also be viewed as [a duration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specious_present "Specious present").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-JamesW-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-3)

[Contemporary history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_history "Contemporary history") describes the [historical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical "Historical")[timeframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeframe "Timeframe") immediately relevant to the present time and is a certain perspective of [modern history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_history "Modern history").

Quotations

> You shouldn't chase after the past or place expectations on the future. What is past is left behind. The future is as yet unreached. Whatever quality is present you clearly see right there, right there.

— [Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha "Gautama Buddha"), Bhaddekaratta Sutta[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-Buddha-4)

> What we perceive as present is the vivid fringe of memory tinged with anticipation.

"The present" raises the question: "How is it that all sentient beings experience _now_ at the same time?"[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-6) There is no logical reason why this should be the case and no easy answer to the question.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism") and many of its associated [paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm "Paradigm") emphasize the importance of living in the present moment—being fully aware of what is happening, and not dwelling on the [past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past "Past") or worrying about the [future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future "Future").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-7) This does not mean that they encourage [hedonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism "Hedonism"), but merely that constant focus on one's current position in space and time (rather than future considerations, or past reminiscence) will aid one in relieving suffering. They teach that those who live in the present moment are the happiest.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-8) A number of [meditative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_meditation "Buddhist meditation") techniques aim to help the practiser live in the present moment.

### Christianity and eternity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Present&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Christianity and eternity")]

Christianity views [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God "God") as being outside of time and, from the divine perspective past, present and future are actualized in the now of [eternity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity "Eternity"). This trans-temporal conception of God has been proposed as a solution to the problem of divine foreknowledge (i.e. how can God know what we will do in the future without us being determined to do it) since at least [Boethius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boethius "Boethius").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-9)[Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") offers the metaphor of a watchman, representing God, standing on a height looking down on a valley to a road where past, present and future, represented by the individuals and their actions strung out along its length, are all visible simultaneously to God.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-10) Therefore, God's knowledge is not tied to any particular date.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-11)

A visualisation of the present (dark blue plane) and past and future [light cones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone "Light cone") in 2D space.

The original intent of the accompanying [light cones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone "Light cone") diagram was to portray a 3-dimensional object having access to the past, present, and future in the present moment (4th dimension).[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]

It [follows from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence "Logical consequence")[Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [Special Theory of Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") that there is [no such thing as absolute simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity "Relativity of simultaneity"). When care is taken to [operationalise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition "Operational definition") "the present", it follows that the events that can be labeled as "simultaneous" with a given event, can not be in [direct cause-effect relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics) "Causality (physics)"). Such collections of events are perceived differently by different observers. Instead, when focusing on "now" as the events [perceived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception "Perception") directly, not as a recollection or a speculation, for a given observer "now" takes the form of the observer's past [light cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone "Light cone"). The light cone of a given event is objectively defined as the collection of events in [causal relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics) "Causality (physics)") to that event, but each event has a different associated light cone. One has to conclude that in relativistic models of physics there is no place for "the present" as an absolute element of reality, and only refers to things that are close to us.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-12) Einstein phrased this as: _"People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion"_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-14)

In [physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology"), the present time in the [chronology of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe "Chronology of the universe") is estimated at 13.8 billion years after the [singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") determining the [arrow of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time "Arrow of time"). In terms of the [cosmic expansion history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe#Expansion_history "Expansion of the universe"), it is in the [dark-energy-dominated era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark-energy-dominated_era "Dark-energy-dominated era"), after the universe's matter content has become diluted enough for [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy") to dominate the total energy density. It is also in the universe's [Stelliferous Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stelliferous_Era "Stelliferous Era"), after enough time for [superclusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercluster "Supercluster") to have formed (at about 5 billion years), but before the [accelerating expansion of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe "Accelerating expansion of the universe") has removed the local supercluster beyond the [cosmological horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_horizon "Cosmological horizon") (at about 150 billion years).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-15)

### Archaeology, geology, etc.

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Present&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Archaeology, geology, etc.")]

In [radiocarbon dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating "Radiocarbon dating"), the "present" is [defined as AD 1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present "Before Present").

In [English grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_grammar "English grammar"), actions are classified according to one of the following twelve verb tenses: past ([past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past "Past"), [past continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_of_English_verb_forms#Past_progressive/continuous "Uses of English verb forms"), [past perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_perfect "Past perfect"), or [past perfect continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_perfect_continuous "Past perfect continuous")), present (present, [present continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_continuous "Present continuous"), [present perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_perfect "Present perfect"), or [present perfect continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_perfect_continuous "Present perfect continuous")), or future ([future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_tense "Future tense"), [future continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_continuous "Future continuous"), [future perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_perfect "Future perfect"), or [future perfect continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_perfect_continuous "Future perfect continuous")).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-auto-16) The present tense refers to things that are currently happening or are always the case.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-auto-16) For example, in the sentence, "she walks home every day," the verb "walks" is in the present tense because it refers to an action that is regularly occurring in the present circumstances.

Verbs in the present continuous tense indicate actions that are currently happening and will continue for a period of time.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-auto-16) In the sentence, "she is walking home," the [verb phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb_phrase "Verb phrase") "is walking" is in the present continuous tense because it refers to a current action that will continue until a certain endpoint (when "she" reaches home). Verbs in the present perfect tense indicate actions that started in the past and is completed at the time of speaking.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-17) For example, in the sentence, "She has walked home," the verb phrase "has walked" is in the present perfect tense because it describes an action that began in the past and is finished as of the current reference to the action. Finally, verbs in the present perfect continuous tense refer to actions that have been continuing up until the current time, thus combining the characteristics of both the continuous and perfect tenses.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#cite_note-auto-16) An example of a present perfect continuous verb phrase can be found in the sentence, "she has been walking this route for a week now," where "has been walking" indicates an action that was happening continuously in the past and continues to happen continuously in the present.
