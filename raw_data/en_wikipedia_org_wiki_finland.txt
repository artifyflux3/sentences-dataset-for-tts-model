Finland , [ a ] officially the Republic of Finland , [ b ] [ c ] is a Nordic country in Northern Europe . It borders Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east, with the Gulf of Bothnia to the west and the Gulf of Finland to the south, opposite Estonia . Finland has a population of 5.6 million, [ 13 ] the majority being ethnic Finns . Its capital and largest city is Helsinki . The official languages are Finnish and Swedish , the mother tongues of 84.1 percent and 5.1 percent of the population, respectively.

[ 1 ] [ 14 ] Finland's climate varies from humid continental in the south to boreal in the north. Its land is predominantly covered by boreal forest , with over 180,000 recorded lakes .

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Finland was first settled around 9000 BC after the last Ice Age .

[ 17 ] During the Stone Age , various cultures emerged, distinguished by different styles of ceramics. The Bronze Age and Iron Ages were marked by contacts with other cultures in Fennoscandia and the Baltic region .

[ 18 ] From the late 13th century, Finland became part of Sweden following the Northern Crusades . In 1809, as a result of the Finnish War , Finland was captured from Sweden and became an autonomous grand duchy within the Russian Empire . During this period, Finnish art flourished and an independence movement gradually developed.

Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Finland declared its independence . A civil war ensued the following year, with the anticommunist Whites emerging victorious. Finland's status as a republic was confirmed in 1919. During World War II , Finland fought against the Soviet Union in the Winter War and the Continuation War , and later against Nazi Germany in the Lapland War . As a result, it lost parts of its territory to the Soviet Union but retained its independence and democracy. During the Cold War , Finland embraced an official policy of neutrality. Since then, it has become a member of the European Union in 1995, the Eurozone in 1999, and, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine , joined NATO in 2023.

Finland became the first country in Europe to grant universal suffrage in 1906, and the first in the world to give all adult citizens the right to run for public office.

[ note 2 ] Finland remained a largely rural and agrarian country until the 1950s, when it pursued rapid industrialisation and a Nordic-style - welfare state , resulting in an advanced economy and high per capita income . The country consistently ranks highly in international rankings across various categories , such as education, economic competitiveness, happiness, and prosperity.

Finnish foreign policy based on its middle power status emphasizes international cooperation and partnership, which has recently shifted towards closer ties with NATO .

Finnish cultural values , including egalitarianism , secularism , human rights and environmentalism , are actively promoted through membership in multiple international forums .

Etymology See also: Finn (ethnonym) § Etymology The name Suomi ( Finnish for 'Finland') has uncertain origins, but a common etymology with saame (the Sami ) has been suggested.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] In the earliest historical sources, from the 12th and 13th centuries, the term Finland refers to the coastal region around Turku in the southwest of modern Finland; this region later became known as Finland Proper in distinction from the country name Finland.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] In the 14th and 15th centuries, the southwest ( Eura and Turku), the interior (around Lake Päijänne ), and the southeast (reaching Lake Ladoga ) regions of modern Finland were incorporated into the Swedish realm.

[ 23 ] The entire area was called Finlandia et partes orientales or Österland ("Eastland") by the Scandinavians.

[ 23 ] The term Österland was used until the 16th century.

[ 24 ] The interior was known as Tavastia .

[ 23 ] By the end of the Middle Ages , the term Finland was extended to the east as well.

[ 25 ] History Main article: History of Finland Prehistory Main article: History of Finland § Prehistory Stone Age bear head gavel found in Paltamo , Kainuu [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Languages of Finland in the early iron age.

The area that is now Finland was settled in, at the latest, around 8,500 BC during the Stone Age towards the end of the last glacial period . The artefacts the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in Estonia , Russia, and Norway.

[ 28 ] The earliest people were hunter-gatherers , using stone tools.

[ 29 ] The first pottery appeared in 5200 BC, when the Comb Ceramic culture was introduced.

[ 30 ] The area of present-day Finland was in the western limits of the culture, which produced pottery with a distinct comb pattern .

[ 31 ] The arrival of the Corded Ware culture in the south of coastal Finland between 3000 and 2500 BC may have coincided with the start of agriculture.

[ 32 ] Even with the introduction of agriculture, hunting and fishing continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy.

Based upon linguistic evidence, Finland seems to have been primarily inhabited by speakers of Paleo-European languages prior to the migration of the Finno-Ugric peoples, which influenced the Saami languages who were the first Finno-Ugric peoples to move towards Finland. These languages have been divided into Paleo-Laplandic languages which was spoken around Lappland, and the Lakelandic languages spoken in most of modern-day Finland.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] Many toponyms in Finland such as Inari, Saimaa, Päijänne and Imatra seem to derive from these Paleo-European languages, as their etymologies are not explainable by either Indo-European or Finno-Ugric roots.

[ 35 ] In the Bronze Age , permanent all-year-round cultivation and animal husbandry spread, but the cold climate slowed the change.

[ 36 ] The Seima-Turbino phenomenon brought the first bronze artefacts to the region and possibly also the Finno-Ugric languages .

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] Commercial contacts that had so far mostly been to Estonia started to extend to Scandinavia. Domestic manufacture of bronze artefacts started 1300 BC.

[ 38 ] Baltic Finnic peoples in the 9th century AD In the Iron Age , population grew.

Finland Proper was the most densely populated area. Commercial contacts in the Baltic Sea region grew and extended during the eighth and ninth centuries. Main exports from Finland were furs, slaves, castoreum , and falcons to European courts. Imports included silk and other fabrics, jewelry, Ulfberht swords , and, in lesser extent, glass. Production of iron started approximately in 500 BC.

[ 39 ] At the end of the ninth century, indigenous artefact culture, especially weapons and women's jewelry, had more common local features than ever before. This has been interpreted to be expressing common Finnish identity.

[ 40 ] An early form of Finnic languages spread to the Baltic Sea region approximately 1900 BC. Common Finnic language was spoken around Gulf of Finland 2000 years ago. The dialects from which the modern-day Finnish language was developed came into existence during the Iron Age.

[ 41 ] Contacts with the ancient Baltic and eastern Germanic peoples greatly influenced the Proto-Finnic language .

[ 31 ] Although distantly related, the Sami people retained the hunter-gatherer lifestyle longer than the Finns. The Sami cultural identity and the Sami language have survived in Lapland , the northernmost province.

Swedish era Main article: Finland under Swedish rule Eric IX of Sweden and Bishop Henry en route to Finland . Late medieval depiction from Uppland .

The 12th and 13th centuries were a violent time in the northern Baltic Sea. The Livonian Crusade was ongoing and the Finnish tribes such as the Tavastians and Karelians were in frequent conflicts with Novgorod and with each other. Also, during the 12th and 13th centuries several crusades from the Catholic realms of the Baltic Sea area were made against the Finnish tribes.

Danes waged at least three crusades to Finland, in 1187 or slightly earlier, [ 42 ] in 1191 and in 1202, [ 43 ] and Swedes , possibly the so-called second Crusade to Finland , in 1249 against Tavastians and the third Crusade to Finland in 1293 against the Karelians. The so-called first Crusade to Finland , possibly in 1155, most likely never occurred.

[ 44 ] As a result of the Crusades, mostly with the Second Swedish Crusade led by Birger Jarl , and the colonization of some Finnish coastal areas with Christian Swedes during the Middle Ages, [ 45 ] Finland gradually became part of the kingdom of Sweden and the sphere of influence of the Catholic Church .

[ 46 ] Under Sweden, Finland was annexed as part of the cultural order of Western Europe .

[ 47 ] The Swedes built fortresses in Häme and Turku , while a Swedish royal council was instituted, an administrative structure and fiscal apparatus was created, and law codes were codified during the reigns of Magnus Ladulås (1275–1290) and Magnus Eriksson (1319–1364).

[ 24 ] As a result, the Finnish lands were firmly integrated into the Swedish realm.

[ 24 ] The Swedish Empire following the Treaty of Roskilde of 1658 Swedish was the dominant language of the nobility, administration, and education; Finnish was chiefly a language for the peasantry , clergy, and local courts in predominantly Finnish-speaking areas.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] During the Protestant Reformation , the Finns gradually converted to Lutheranism .

[ 50 ] The end of the Kalmar Union ushered in an era of religious, social, and economic changes.

[ 51 ] Gustav Vasa ( r.

1523–1560 ) made his second son Johan the duke of Finland , while Gustav Adolf ( r.

1611–1632 ) created the office of governor-general for Finland as part of his restructuring of the administration of the Swedish realm.

[ 52 ] In the 16th century, a bishop and Lutheran Reformer Mikael Agricola published the first written works in Finnish; [ 53 ] and Finland's current capital city, Helsinki , was founded by King Gustav Vasa in 1555.

[ 54 ] The first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku , was established by Queen Christina of Sweden at the proposal of Count Per Brahe in 1640.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] The Finns reaped a reputation in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) as a well-trained cavalrymen called " Hakkapeliitta ".

[ 57 ] Finland suffered a severe famine in 1695–1697 , during which about one third of the Finnish population died, [ 58 ] and a devastating plague occurred a few years later .

In the 18th century, wars between Sweden and Russia twice led to the occupation of Finland by Russian forces, times known to the Finns as the Greater Wrath (1714–1721) and the Lesser Wrath (1742–1743).

[ 59 ] [ 58 ] It is estimated that almost an entire generation of young men was lost during the Great Wrath, due mainly to the destruction of homes and farms, and the burning of Helsinki.

[ 60 ] Grand Duchy of Finland Main article: Grand Duchy of Finland The Swedish era ended with the Finnish War of 1809. On 29 March 1809, after being conquered by the armies of Alexander I of Russia , Finland became an autonomous grand duchy within the Russian Empire , as recognised by the Diet of Porvoo .

[ 61 ] This situation continued until the end of 1917.

[ 59 ] In 1812, Alexander I incorporated the Russian province of Vyborg into the Grand Duchy of Finland. In 1854, Finland became involved in Russia's involvement in the Crimean War when the British and French navies bombed the Finnish coast and Åland during the so-called Åland War .

[ 62 ] Edvard Isto , The Attack , 1899. The Russian eagle is attacking the Finnish Maiden , trying to steal her book of laws.

Although Swedish was still widely spoken, the Finnish language began to gain recognition during this period. From the 1860s, a strong Finnish nationalist movement , known as the Fennoman movement , grew. One of the movement's most prominent leaders was the philosopher and politician J.V. Snellman , who worked to stabilise the status of the Finnish language and its own currency, the Finnish markka , in the Grand Duchy of Finland.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland's national epic , the Kalevala , in 1835 and the legal equality of the Finnish language with Swedish in 1892. In the spirit of Adolf Ivar Arwidsson – "we are not Swedes, we do not want to become Russians, so let us be Finns" – a Finnish national identity was established.

[ 64 ] Nevertheless, there was no real independence movement in Finland until the early 20th century.

[ 65 ] The Finnish famine of 1866–1868 occurred after freezing temperatures in early September devastated crops and killed around 15% of the population, making it one of the worst famines in European history.

[ 66 ] The famine led the Russian Empire to relax financial regulations, and investment increased in the following decades. Economic development was rapid.

[ 67 ] The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was still half of that of the United States and a third of that of Britain.

[ 67 ] The first session of the Parliament of Finland in 1907 From 1869 to 1917, the Russian Empire pursued a policy of Russification , which was suspended between 1905 and 1908. In 1906, universal suffrage was introduced in the Grand Duchy of Finland. However, relations between the Grand Duchy of Finland and the Russian Empire soured when the Russian government began to take steps to restrict Finland's special status and autonomy. For example, universal suffrage was virtually meaningless in practice, as the tsar did not have to approve any of the laws passed by the Finnish parliament. The desire for independence gained ground, first among radical liberals [ 68 ] and socialists , partly driven by a declaration called the February Manifesto by the last tsar of the Russian Empire, Nicholas II , on 15 February 1899.

[ 69 ] Civil war and early independence Main articles: Independence of Finland and Finnish Civil War After the February Revolution of 1917, Finland's position as a Grand Duchy under the rule of the Russian Empire was questioned. The Finnish parliament , controlled by the Social Democrats , passed the so-called Power Act to give the parliament supreme authority. This was rejected by the Russian Provisional Government , which decided to dissolve the parliament.

[ 70 ] New elections were held in which the right-wing parties won by a small majority. Some social democrats refused to accept the result, claiming that the dissolution of parliament and the subsequent elections were extra-legal. The two almost equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the Social Democratic Party, were deeply divided.

Finnish military leader and statesman C. G. E. Mannerheim as general officer leading the White Victory Parade at the end of the Finnish Civil War in Helsinki, 1918 The October Revolution in Russia changed the geopolitical situation once again. Suddenly the right-wing parties in Finland began to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of supreme executive power from the Russian government to Finland when the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia. The right-wing government, led by Prime Minister P. E. Svinhufvud , presented the Declaration of Independence on 4 December 1917, which was officially approved by the Finnish Parliament on 6 December. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), led by Vladimir Lenin was the first country to recognise Finland's independence on 4 January 1918.

[ 71 ] On 27 January 1918, the government began to disarm the Russian forces in Ostrobothnia . The socialists took control of southern Finland and Helsinki, but the white government continued in exile in Vaasa .

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] This led to a short but bitter civil war . The Whites , backed by Imperial Germany , prevailed over the Reds [ 74 ] and their self-proclaimed Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic .

[ 75 ] After the war, tens of thousands of Reds were interned in camps where thousands were executed or died of malnutrition and disease. A deep social and political enmity was sown between the Reds and the Whites that would last until the Winter War and beyond.

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] The civil war and the activist expeditions to Soviet Russia in 1918–1920, known as the " Kinship Wars ", strained relations with the East.

[ 78 ] [ 79 ] Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 1938 After a brief experiment with monarchy , when an attempt to make Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse the king of Finland failed, a republican constitution was adopted and Finland became a presidential republic , with K. J. Ståhlberg elected as its first president on 25 July 1919.

[ 80 ] A liberal nationalist with a legal background, Ståhlberg anchored the state in liberal democracy , promoted the rule of law and initiated internal reforms.

[ 81 ] Finland was also one of the first European countries to strongly promote women's equality , with Miina Sillanpää becoming the first female minister in Finnish history in Väinö Tanner's cabinet in 1926–1927.

[ 82 ] The Finnish-Russian border was established in 1920 by the Treaty of Tartu , which largely followed the historical border but gave Finland Pechenga ( Finnish : Petsamo ) and its Barents Sea port.

[ 59 ] Finnish democracy survived Soviet coup attempts and the anti-communist Lapua movement .

In 1917 there were three million people in the country. After the civil war, a credit-based land reform was introduced, increasing the proportion of the population with access to capital.

[ 67 ] About 70% of the workforce was employed in agriculture and 10% in industry.

[ 83 ] World War II Main article: Finland in World War II Finnish troops raise a flag on the three-country cairn in April 1945 at the close of the World War II in Finland .

The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939, which divided Europe into spheres of influence between the two dictatorships.

[ 84 ] In accordance with the pact, the Soviet Union launched the Winter War on 30 November 1939 in order to annex Finland.

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] The Finnish Democratic Republic was set up by Joseph Stalin at the beginning of the war to govern Finland after Soviet conquest.

[ 87 ] There was widespread international condemnation of the unprovoked attack and it led to the Soviet Union being expelled from the League of Nations .

[ 88 ] The Red Army was defeated in numerous battles, most notably the Battle of Suomussalmi .

[ 89 ] After two months of negligible progress on the battlefield, as well as heavy losses in men and material, [ 90 ] Soviet forces began to advance in February and reached Vyborg ( Finnish : Viipuri ) in March. The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed on 12 March 1940, and the war ended the following day. Finland had defended its independence, but ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union.

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] Between 1939 and 1944, some 400,000 people were evacuated from Karelia .

Areas ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union during World War II . The Porkkala land lease was returned to Finland in 1956.

Hostilities resumed in June 1941 with the Continuation War , when Finland allied itself with Germany following the latter's invasion of the Soviet Union ; the main aim was to regain the territory lost to the Soviets barely a year earlier.

[ 93 ] Finnish troops occupied Eastern Karelia from 1941 to 1944 and assisted the German army in the Siege of Leningrad .

[ 94 ] The massive Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive in the summer of 1944 led to a breakthrough until the Finns finally repulsed it at Tali–Ihantala . This partial Soviet success led to a stalemate and later an armistice . This was followed by the Lapland War of 1944–1945, when Finland fought retreating German forces in northern Finland.

The Armistice and treaty signed with the Soviet Union in 1944 and 1948 included Finnish obligations, restraints, and reparations, as well as further territorial concessions. As a result of the two wars, Finland lost 12% of its land area, 20% of its industrial capacity, its second largest city, Vyborg ( Finnish : Viipuri ), and the ice-free port of Liinakhamari ( Finnish : Liinahamari ).

[ 92 ] The Finns lost around 97,000 soldiers and were forced to pay war reparations initially set at $300 million in 1938 prices, later adjusted to $226.5 million.

[ 95 ] However, the country avoided occupation by Soviet forces and managed to retain its independence. Along with Great Britain , Finland emerged from the war as one of the only European countries to have taken part in hostilities that was never occupied and managed to preserve its democracy throughout.

[ 96 ] In the decades following World War II, the Communists were a strong political party. Furthermore, the Soviet Union persuaded Finland to refuse Marshall Plan aid. However, in the hope of preserving Finland's independence, the United States provided secret development aid and supported the Social Democratic Party .

[ 97 ] After the war Urho Kekkonen was Finland's longest-serving president in 1956–1982.

The development of trade with the Western powers, such as the United Kingdom, and the payment of reparations to the Soviet Union led to Finland's transformation from a primarily agrarian society to an industrialised one.

Valmet , originally a shipyard and then several metal workshops, was established to produce materials for war reparations. After the reparations were paid, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union as part of bilateral trade .

In 1950, 46% of Finnish workers were employed in agriculture and a third lived in urban areas, but new jobs in manufacturing, services and trade quickly attracted people to the cities.

[ 98 ] The average number of births per woman fell from a baby boom peak of 3.5 in 1947 to 1.5 in 1973. As the baby boomers entered the workforce, the economy failed to create jobs fast enough and hundreds of thousands emigrated to more industrialised Sweden, with emigration peaking in 1969 and 1970.

[ 98 ] Finland participated in trade liberalisation in the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .

During the Cold War , Finland officially embraced a policy of neutrality . The YYA Treaty (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance) recognized Finland's desire to remain outside great-power conflicts. From 1956 president Urho Kekkonen had a virtual monopoly on relations with the Soviet Union, which was crucial to his continued popularity. In politics, there was a tendency to avoid any policy or statement that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. This phenomenon was dubbed " Finlandisation " by the West German press.

[ 99 ] Alvar Aalto 's Finlandia Hall hosted the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in 1975.

A market economy was maintained in Finland. Various industries benefited from trade privileges with the Soviets. Economic growth was rapid in the post-war period, and by 1975 Finland's GDP per capita was the 15th highest in the world. During the 1970s and 1980s, Finland built one of the most extensive welfare states in the world. In 1973, Finland negotiated a treaty with the European Economic Community (EEC) that reduced tariffs, enhancing trade relations.

[ 100 ] Miscalculated macroeconomic decisions, a banking crisis , the collapse of its largest trading partner, the Soviet Union, and a global economic downturn caused a deep recession in Finland in the early 1990s . The recession bottomed out in 1993 and Finland enjoyed more than a decade of steady economic growth.

[ 101 ] After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Finland began to integrate more closely with the West.

[ 102 ] Finland joined the European Union in 1995 and the euro zone in 1999. Much of the economic growth of the late 1990s was fuelled by the success of mobile phone manufacturer Nokia .

[ 47 ] [ 103 ] 21st century Prime Minister Sanna Marin and President Sauli Niinistö at the press conference announcing Finland's intent to apply to NATO on 15 May 2022 The Finnish people elected Tarja Halonen in the 2000 Presidential election , making her the first female President of Finland.

[ 104 ] Her predecessor, President Martti Ahtisaari , later won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008. The 2008 financial crisis paralysed  Finland's exports in 2008, leading to weaker economic growth throughout the decade.

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] Sauli Niinistö was elected President of Finland from 2012 until 2024, when Alexander Stubb took over.

[ 107 ] [ 108 ] Finnish support for NATO rose sharply after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 . Before February 2022, opinion polls showed a narrow but decisive majority against NATO membership; [ 109 ] by April, a supermajority was in favour of membership.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ] On 11 May 2022, Finland signed a mutual security pact with the United Kingdom.

[ 114 ] On 12 May, Finland's president and Prime Minister called for NATO membership "without delay".

[ 115 ] Subsequently, on 17 May, the Finnish Parliament voted 188–8 in favour of Finland's accession to NATO.

[ 116 ] Finland became a member of NATO on 4 April 2023.

Find sources: "Finland" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( April 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Topographic map of Finland Lying approximately between latitudes 60° and 70° N , and longitudes 20° and 32° E , Finland is one of the world's northernmost countries. Of world capitals, only Reykjavík lies more to the north than Helsinki. The distance from the southernmost point – Hanko in Uusimaa – to the northernmost – Nuorgam in Lapland – is 1,160 kilometres (720 mi).

Finland has about 168,000 lakes (of area larger than 500 m 2 or 0.12 acres) and 179,000 islands.

[ 118 ] Its largest lake, Saimaa , is the fourth largest in Europe. The Finnish Lakeland is the area with the most lakes in the country; [ 16 ] many of the major cities in the area, most notably Tampere , Jyväskylä and Kuopio , are located near the large lakes. Lying off the coast of Finland is the world's largest archipelago, a formation consisting of more than 50,000 islands. The greatest concentration of these islands is found in the southwest in a part of the Baltic Sea called the Archipelago Sea , between continental Finland and the island of Åland .

[ 119 ] Much of the geography of Finland is a result of the Ice Age. The glaciers were thicker and lasted longer in Fennoscandia compared with the rest of Europe. The eroding effects have contributed to a mostly flat landscape in Finland, characterized by hills. However, in the northern regions, including areas bordering the Scandinavian Mountains , the terrain features mountainous elevations. At 1,324 metres (4,344 ft), Halti is the highest point in Finland. It is found in the north of Lapland at the border between Finland and Norway. The highest mountain whose peak is entirely in Finland is Ridnitšohkka at 1,316 m (4,318 ft), directly adjacent to Halti.

The view from the top of Saana fell in Kilpisjärvi There are some 187,888 lakes in Finland larger than 500 square metres and 75,818 islands of over 0,5 km2 area, leading to the denomination "the land of a thousand lakes".

[ 15 ] Picture of Lake Pielinen in North Karelia .

The retreating glaciers have left the land with morainic deposits in formations of eskers . These are ridges of stratified gravel and sand, running northwest to southeast, where the ancient edge of the glacier once lay. Among the biggest of these are the three Salpausselkä ridges that run across southern Finland.

Having been compressed under the enormous weight of the glaciers, terrain in Finland is rising due to the post-glacial rebound . The effect is strongest around the Gulf of Bothnia, where land steadily rises about 1 cm (0.4 in) a year. As a result, the old sea bottom turns little by little into dry land: the surface area of the country is expanding by about 7 square kilometres (2.7 sq mi) annually.

[ 120 ] Relatively speaking, Finland is rising from the sea.

[ 121 ] The landscape is covered mostly by coniferous taiga forests and fens , with little cultivated land. Of the total area, 10% is lakes, rivers, and ponds, and 78% is forest. The forest consists of pine , spruce , birch , and other species.

[ 122 ] Finland is the largest producer of wood in Europe and among the largest in the world. The most common type of rock is granite . It is a ubiquitous part of the scenery, visible wherever there is no soil cover. Moraine or till is the most common type of soil, covered by a thin layer of humus of biological origin.

Podzol profile development is seen in most forest soils except where drainage is poor.

Gleysols and peat bogs occupy poorly drained areas.

Biodiversity Main articles: Fauna of Finland and Wildlife of Finland In Finland, reindeer graze in Lapland area and on the fells .

The brown bear is Finland's national animal.

[ 123 ] It is also the largest carnivore in Finland.

Phytogeographically , Finland is shared between the Arctic, central European, and northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom . According to the WWF , the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three ecoregions : the Scandinavian and Russian taiga , Sarmatic mixed forests , and Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands .

[ 124 ] Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland. On the southwestern coast, south of the Helsinki- Rauma line, forests are characterized by mixed forests, that are more typical in the Baltic region. In the extreme north of Finland, near the tree line and Arctic Ocean, Montane Birch forests are common. Finland had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.08/10, ranking it 109th globally out of 172 countries.

[ 125 ] Similarly, Finland has a diverse and extensive range of fauna. There are at least sixty native mammalian species, 248 breeding bird species, over 70 fish species, and 11 reptile and frog species present today, many migrating from neighbouring countries thousands of years ago.
Large and widely recognized wildlife mammals found in Finland are the brown bear , grey wolf , wolverine , and elk . Three of the more striking birds are the whooper swan , a large European swan and the national bird of Finland; the Western capercaillie , a large, black-plumaged member of the grouse family; and the Eurasian eagle-owl . The latter is considered an indicator of old-growth forest connectivity, and has been declining because of landscape fragmentation.

[ 126 ] Around 24,000 species of insects are prevalent in Finland some of the most common being hornets with tribes of beetles such as the Onciderini also being common. The most common breeding birds are the willow warbler , common chaffinch , and redwing .

[ 127 ] Of some seventy species of freshwater fish, the northern pike , perch , and others are plentiful.

Atlantic salmon remains the favourite of fly rod enthusiasts.

The endangered Saimaa ringed seal , one of only three lake seal species in the world, exists only in the Saimaa lake system of southeastern Finland, down to only 390 seals today.

[ 128 ] [ 129 ] The species has become the emblem of the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation.

[ 130 ] A third of Finland's land area originally consisted of moorland , about half of this area has been drained for cultivation over the past centuries.

[ 131 ] Climate Main article: Climate of Finland Köppen climate classification types of Finland The main factor influencing Finland's climate is the country's geographical position between the 60th and 70th northern parallels in the Eurasian continent's coastal zone. In the Köppen climate classification , the whole of Finland lies in the boreal zone , characterized by warm summers and freezing winters. Within the country, the temperateness varies considerably between the southern coastal regions and the extreme north, showing characteristics of both a maritime and a continental climate . Finland is near enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be continuously warmed by the Gulf Stream . The Gulf Stream combines with the moderating effects of the Baltic Sea and numerous inland lakes to explain the unusually warm climate compared with other regions that share the same latitude , such as Alaska , Siberia , and southern Greenland .

[ 132 ] Share of forest area in total land area, top countries (2021). Finland has the tenth highest percentage of forest cover in the world.

Winters in southern Finland (when the mean daily temperature remains below 0 °C or 32 °F) are usually about 100 days long, and in the inland the snow typically covers the land from about late November to April, and on the coastal areas such as Helsinki, snow often covers the land from late December to late March.

[ 133 ] Even in the south, the harshest winter nights can see the temperatures fall to −30 °C (−22 °F), although on coastal areas like Helsinki, temperatures below −30 °C (−22 °F) are rare. Climatic summers (when mean daily temperature remains above 10 °C or 50 °F) in southern Finland last from about late May to mid-September, and in the inland, the warmest days of July can reach over 35 °C (95 °F).

[ 132 ] Although most of Finland lies on the taiga belt, the southernmost coastal regions are sometimes classified as hemiboreal .

[ 134 ] In northern Finland, particularly in Lapland, the winters are long and cold, while the summers are relatively warm but short. On the most severe winter days in Lapland can see the temperature fall to −45 °C (−49 °F). The winter of the north lasts for about 200 days with permanent snow cover from about mid-October to early May. Summers in the north are quite short, only two to three months, but can still see maximum daily temperatures above 25 °C (77 °F) during heat waves.

[ 132 ] No part of Finland has Arctic tundra , but Alpine tundra can be found at the fells Lapland.

[ 134 ] The Finnish climate is suitable for cereal farming only in the southernmost regions, while the northern regions are suitable for animal husbandry .

[ 135 ] A quarter of Finland's territory lies within the Arctic Circle and the midnight sun can be experienced for more days the farther north one travels. At Finland's northernmost point, the sun does not set for 73 consecutive days during summer and does not rise at all for 51 days during winter.

[ 132 ] Finland is ranked 4th in Environmental Performance Index for year 2024.

[ 136 ] This Index combines various indicators around known issues around the world and measures how good they fit in among each countries on a scale. Finland scores good in parameters like Climate Change Mitigation, Waste Management, Air pollution, Air quality etc.

[ 137 ] Regions Main article: Regions of Finland Finland consists of 19 regions ( maakunta ). The counties are governed by regional councils which serve as forums of cooperation for the municipalities of a county. The main tasks of the counties are regional planning and development of enterprise and education. In addition, the public health services are usually organized based on counties. Regional councils are elected by municipal councils, each municipality sending representatives in proportion to its population. In addition to inter-municipal cooperation, which is the responsibility of regional councils, each county has a state Employment and Economic Development Centre which is responsible for the local administration of labour, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and entrepreneurial affairs. Historically, counties are divisions of historical provinces of Finland , areas that represent local dialects and culture more accurately.

Six Regional State Administrative Agencies are responsible for one of the counties called alue in Finnish; in addition, Åland was designated a seventh county.

[ 140 ] Administrative divisions Main articles: Administrative divisions of Finland , Sub-regions of Finland , Municipalities of Finland , and Historical provinces of Finland Municipalities (thin borders) and regions (thick borders) of Finland (2021) The fundamental administrative divisions of the country are the municipalities , which may also call themselves towns or cities. They account for half of the public spending. Spending is financed by municipal income tax, state subsidies, and other revenue. As of 2021 [update] , there are 309 municipalities, [ 141 ] and most have fewer than 6,000 residents.

In addition to municipalities, two intermediate levels are defined. Municipalities co-operate in seventy sub-regions and nineteen counties . These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. The autonomous province of Åland has a permanent democratically elected regional council. Sami people have a semi-autonomous Sami native region in Lapland for issues on language and culture.

Health , social and emergency services are organised by the Wellbeing services counties . Finland has 21 Wellbeing services counties and the county structure is mainly based on the region structure. The County council , which is responsible for the operation, administration and finances of the area, is the highest decision-making body in the Wellbeing services county. The delegates and deputy commissioners of the county council are elected in the county elections for a term of office of four years. Wellbeing services counties are self-governing. However, they do not have the right to levy taxes and their funding is based on central government funding.

[ 142 ] The capital region – comprising Helsinki, Vantaa , Espoo and Kauniainen – forms a continuous conurbation of approximately 1.28 million people. However, common administration is limited to voluntary cooperation of all municipalities, e.g. in Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council .

Government and politics Main article: Politics of Finland Alexander Stubb , 13th President since 1 March 2024 Petteri Orpo , 47th Prime Minister since 20 June 2023 Modern Finnish values are rooted in egalitarian ideals.

[ 148 ] Finland is a member of: the Eurozone the European Union Constitution The Constitution of Finland defines the political system; Finland is a parliamentary republic within the framework of a representative democracy . The Prime Minister is the country's most powerful person. Citizens can run and vote in parliamentary, municipal, presidential, and European Union elections .

President Main article: President of Finland Finland's head of state is the President of the Republic . Finland had, for most of its independence a semi-presidential system of government, but in the last few decades the powers of the president have become more circumscribed, and consequently the country is now considered a parliamentary republic .

[ 2 ] A new constitution, enacted in 2000, made the presidency primarily a ceremonial office. The president appoints the prime minister as elected by Parliament , appoints and dismisses the other ministers of the Finnish Government on the recommendation of the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, and confers state honors. Nevertheless, the president remains responsible for Finland's foreign relations , including the making of war and peace, but excluding matters related to the European Union .

[ 149 ] Moreover, the president exercises supreme command over the Finnish Defence Forces as commander-in-chief. In the exercise of his or her foreign and defense powers, the president is required to consult the Finnish government , but the government's advice is not binding. In addition, the president has several domestic reserve powers , including the authority to veto legislation, to grant pardons, and to appoint several public officials.

[ 150 ] The president is also required by the Constitution to dismiss individual ministers or the entire government upon a parliamentary vote of no confidence.

[ 151 ] The president is directly elected via runoff voting and may serve for a maximum of two consecutive 6-year terms. The current president is Alexander Stubb , who took office on 1 March 2024 . His predecessors were Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg (1919–1925), Lauri Kristian Relander (1925–1931), Pehr Evind Svinhufvud (1931–1937), Kyösti Kallio (1937–1940), Risto Ryti (1940–1944), Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim (1944–1946), Juho Kusti Paasikivi (1946–1956), Urho Kekkonen (1956–1982), Mauno Koivisto (1982–1994), Martti Ahtisaari (1994–2000), Tarja Halonen (2000–2012), and Sauli Niinistö (2012–2024).

Its acts are not subject to judicial review; the constitutionality of new laws is assessed by the parliament's constitutional law committee . The parliament is elected for a term of four years using the proportional D'Hondt method within several multi-seat constituencies through the most open list multi-member districts. Various parliament committees listen to experts and prepare legislation.

Significant parliamentary parties are Centre Party , Christian Democrats , Finns Party , Green League , Left Alliance , National Coalition Party , Social Democrats and Swedish People's Party .

Cabinet Main article: Finnish Government See also: Prime Minister of Finland After parliamentary elections, the parties negotiate among themselves on forming a new cabinet (the Finnish Government ), which then has to be approved by a simple majority vote in the parliament. The cabinet can be dismissed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, although this rarely happens, as the parties represented in the cabinet usually make up a majority in the parliament.

The cabinet exercises most executive powers and originates most of the bills that the parliament then debates and votes on. It is headed by the Prime Minister of Finland , and consists of him or her, other ministers, and the Chancellor of Justice . Each minister heads his or her ministry, or, in some cases, has responsibility for a subset of a ministry's policy. After the prime minister, the most powerful minister is often the minister of finance .

As no one party ever dominates the parliament, Finnish cabinets are multi-party coalitions. As a rule, the post of prime minister goes to the leader of the biggest party and that of the minister of finance to the leader of the second biggest.

The Orpo Cabinet is the incumbent 77th government of Finland. It took office on 20 June 2023. The cabinet is headed by Petteri Orpo and is a coalition between the National Coalition Party, Finns Party, the Swedish People's Party, and the Christian Democrats.

[ 172 ] [ 173 ] On 18 December 2023, Finland signed the Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) with the United States, which regulates the presence of the U.S. armed forces and their dependents on Finnish territory and the presence and activities of U.S. defence suppliers.

[ 174 ] Human rights Main article: Human rights in Finland People gathering at the Senate Square , Helsinki , before the 2022 Helsinki Pride parade started Finland has one of the world's most extensive welfare systems , one that guarantees decent living conditions for all residents. The welfare system was created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II.

Additionally, Finland boasts a well-developed welfare system that encompasses free education and universal healthcare, contributing to its reputation as one of the wealthiest nations.

The service sector constitutes the largest segment of the economy, amounting to 66% of the GDP, while manufacturing and refining make up 31%.

Primary production accounts for 2.9% of the economy.

[ 183 ] Manufacturing is the primary economic sector concerning foreign trade .

[ 184 ] The predominant industrial sectors in 2007 were electronics (22%), machinery, vehicles, and other engineered metal products (21.1%), forest industry (13%), and chemicals (11%). The gross domestic product reached its peak in 2021.

[ 189 ] For the rural population, forestry , paper mills and agriculture are important. The Helsinki metropolitan area accounts for roughly one-third of Finland's GDP. Private services represent the largest employer in Finland.

Finland's soil and climate pose particular challenges for crop production, with harsh winters and relatively short growing seasons, often interrupted by frost. However, the prevalence of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current in Finland's temperate climate allows for half of the world's arable land north of the 60° north latitude. Although annual precipitation is generally adequate, it mostly transpires during winter, which poses a continuous risk of summer droughts. Farmers have adapted to the climate by relying on quick-ripening and frost-resistant crop varieties. They cultivate south-facing slopes and rich bottomlands to ensure year-round production, even during summer frosts. Drainage systems are often utilized to remove excess water. Finland's agricultural sector has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and productivity, particularly in comparison to its European counterparts.

[ 175 ] Forests are crucial to the nation's economy, making it one of the world's foremost wood producers and offering raw materials at competitive prices to the wood processing industries. The government has played an important role in forestry for a considerable period similar to that in agriculture. It has regulated tree cutting, sponsored technical improvements, and established long-term plans to guarantee the sustainability of the country's forests in supplying the wood-processing industries.

[ 175 ] As of 2008 [update] , the average level of income, adjusted for purchasing power, was comparable to that of Italy, Sweden, Germany and France.

A Finnair airplane in Helsinki Airport Finland's road system is utilized by most internal cargo and passenger traffic. The annual state operated road network expenditure of around €1 billion is paid for with vehicle and fuel taxes which amount to around €1.5 billion and €1 billion, respectively. Among the Finnish highways , the most significant and busiest main roads include the Turku Highway ( E18 ), the Tampere Highway ( E12 ), the Lahti Highway ( E75 ), and the ring roads ( Ring I and Ring III ) of the Helsinki metropolitan area and the Tampere Ring Road of the Tampere urban area .

[ 207 ] The main international passenger gateway is Helsinki Airport , which handled about 15.3 million passengers in 2023.

[ 208 ] Another 26 airports have scheduled passenger services.

[ 209 ] The Helsinki Airport-based Finnair , Blue1 , and Nordic Regional Airlines , Norwegian Air Shuttle sell air services both domestically and internationally.

The Government annually spends around €350 million to maintain the 5,865-kilometre-long (3,644 mi) network of railway tracks. Rail transport is handled by the state-owned VR Group .

[ 210 ] Finland's first railway was opened in 1862, [ 211 ] [ 212 ] and today it forms part of the Finnish Main Line , which is more than 800 kilometers long. Helsinki opened the world's northernmost metro system in 1982.

The majority of international cargo shipments are handled at ports.

Vuosaari Harbour in Helsinki is the largest container port in Finland; others include Kotka , Hamina , Hanko , Pori , Rauma , and Oulu . There is passenger traffic from Helsinki and Turku, which have ferry connections to Tallinn , Mariehamn , Stockholm and Travemünde . The Helsinki-Tallinn route is one of the busiest passenger sea routes in the world.

[ 213 ] Industry Main article: Economy of Finland The Oasis of the Seas was built at the Perno shipyard in Turku .

Finland rapidly industrialized after World War II, achieving GDP per capita levels comparable to that of Japan or the UK at the beginning of the 1970s. Initially, most of the economic development was based on two broad groups of export-led industries, the "metal industry" ( metalliteollisuus ) and "forest industry" ( metsäteollisuus ). The "metal industry" includes shipbuilding, metalworking, the automotive industry , engineered products such as motors and electronics , and production of metals and alloys including steel , copper and chromium . Many of the world's biggest cruise ships , including MS Freedom of the Seas and the Oasis of the Seas have been built in Finnish shipyards.

[ 214 ] [ 215 ] The "forest industry" includes forestry, timber, pulp and paper, and is often considered a logical development based on Finland's extensive forest resources, as 73% of the area is covered by forest. In the pulp and paper industry , many major companies are based in Finland; Ahlstrom-Munksjö , Metsä Board , and UPM are all Finnish forest-based companies with revenues exceeding €1 billion. However, in recent decades, the Finnish economy has diversified, with companies expanding into fields such as electronics ( Nokia ), metrology ( Vaisala ), petroleum ( Neste ), and video games ( Rovio Entertainment ), and is no longer dominated by the two sectors of metal and forest industry. Likewise, the structure has changed, with the service sector growing. Despite this, production for export is still more prominent than in Western Europe, thus making Finland possibly more vulnerable to global economic trends.

In 2023, the Finnish economy was estimated to consist of approximately 2.3% agriculture, 23.9% manufacturing, and 61.4% services.

[ 216 ] In 2019, the per-capita income of Finland was estimated to be $48,869. In 2020, Finland was ranked 20th on the ease of doing business index , among 190 jurisdictions.

[ 221 ] In Finland, collective labour agreements are universally valid. These are drafted every few years for each profession and seniority level, with only a few jobs outside the system. The agreement becomes universally enforceable provided that more than 50% of the employees support it, in practice by being a member of a relevant trade union. The unionization rate is high (70%), especially in the middle class ( AKAVA , mostly for university-educated professionals: 80%).

[ 223 ] In 2017, there were 15.2 million overnight stays of domestic tourists and 6.7 million overnight stays of foreign tourists.

[ 224 ] Tourism contributes roughly 2.7% to Finland's GDP.

[ 225 ] Lapland has the highest tourism consumption of any Finnish region.

[ 225 ] Above the Arctic Circle , in midwinter, there is a polar night , a period when the sun does not rise for days or weeks, or even months, and correspondingly, midnight sun in the summer, with no sunset even at midnight (for up to 73 consecutive days, at the northernmost point). Lapland is so far north that the aurora borealis , fluorescence in the high atmosphere due to solar wind , is seen regularly in the fall, winter, and spring. Finnish Lapland is also locally regarded as the home of Santa Claus , with several theme parks, such as Santa Claus Village and Santa Park in Rovaniemi .

[ 16 ] [ 226 ] [ 227 ] Other significant tourist destinations in Lapland also include ski resorts (such as Levi , Ruka and Ylläs ) [ 16 ] [ 228 ] and sleigh rides led by either reindeer or huskies .

[ 229 ] [ 230 ] Now lying within Helsinki, Suomenlinna is a UNESCO World Heritage Site consisting of an inhabited 18th-century sea fortress built on six islands. It is one of Finland's most popular tourist attractions.

Tourist attractions in Finland include the natural landscape found throughout the country as well as urban attractions. Finland contains 40 national parks (such as Koli National Park in North Karelia ), from the Southern shores of the Gulf of Finland to the high fells of Lapland. Outdoor activities range from Nordic skiing , golf, fishing, yachting , lake cruises, hiking, and kayaking , among many others.

Bird-watching is popular for those fond of avifauna, however, hunting is also popular.

The birth rate is 7.8 per 1,000 inhabitants, giving a fertility rate of 1.26 children born per woman , [ 235 ] one of the lowest in the world and well below the replacement rate of 2.1. In 1887, Finland recorded its highest rate, with 5.17 children born per woman.

[ 236 ] The child mortality rate is 2.1 deaths per every 1,000 births, one of the lowest in the world; this is attributed to a strong medical system and robust maternal care initiatives, including the maternity package programme .

[ 237 ] Finland has one of the oldest populations in the world, with a median age of 44.0 years and 23.6% of the population aged 65 and over.

[ 1 ] Finland has an average population density of 19 inhabitants per square kilometre.

[ 1 ] This is the third lowest population density in Europe, after Norway and Iceland , and the lowest in the European Union. Finland's population has always been concentrated in the southern parts of the country, a phenomenon that became more pronounced during the urbanisation of the 20th century. Three of Finland's four largest cities are located in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area : Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa .

[ 238 ] The city of Tampere is third after Helsinki and Espoo, and Vantaa is fourth. Other cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants are Turku , Oulu , Jyväskylä , Kuopio and Lahti .

Finland's immigrant population is growing.

[ 1 ] As of 2024 [update] , there were 623,949 people with a foreign background living in Finland (11.1% of the population), most of them from the former Soviet Union, Estonia, Iraq, Somalia, Ukraine, China and India.

[ 1 ] The children of foreigners are not automatically granted Finnish citizenship, as Finnish citizenship law maintains a policy of jus sanguinis , whereby only children born to at least one Finnish parent are granted citizenship.  If they are born in Finland and cannot obtain citizenship of another country, they become Finnish citizens.

[ 239 ] In addition, certain people of Finnish descent living in countries that were once part of the Soviet Union retain the right of return , i.e. the right to establish permanent residence in the country, which would eventually entitle them to citizenship.

[ 240 ] As of 2024 [update] , 10.3% of the Finnish population were foreign born. As a result of recent immigration, the country has significant populations of ethnic Estonians , Russians , Ukrainians , Iraqis , Chinese , Somalis , Filipinos , Indians and Iranians .

[ 246 ] ) and in the autonomous region of Åland , which is the only monolingual Swedish-speaking region in Finland.

[ 247 ] As of 2024 [update] , the native language of 84.1% of the population was Finnish, [ 1 ] which is part of the Finnic subgroup of the Uralic language . The language is one of only four official EU languages not of Indo-European origin, and has no relation through descent to the other national languages of the Nordics . Conversely, Finnish is closely related to Estonian and Karelian , and more distantly to Hungarian and the Sami languages .

Swedish is the native language of 5.1% of the population ( Swedish-speaking Finns ).

[ 1 ] Swedish is a compulsory school subject and general knowledge of the language is good among many non-native speakers.

[ 248 ] Likewise, a majority of Swedish-speaking non-Ålanders can speak Finnish.

[ 249 ] The Finnish side of the land border with Sweden is unilingually Finnish-speaking. The Swedish across the border is distinct from the Swedish spoken in Finland. There is a sizeable pronunciation difference between the varieties of Swedish spoken in the two countries, although their mutual intelligibility is nearly universal.

[ 250 ] Finnish Romani is spoken by some 5,000–6,000 people; there are 13,000-14,000 Romani people in Finland [ 251 ] Romani and Finnish Sign Language are also recognized in the constitution.

Tatar is spoken by a Finnish Tatar minority of about 800 people whose ancestors moved to Finland mainly between the 1870s and 1920s.

[ 253 ] The Sámi languages have an official status in parts of Lapland, where the Sámi , numbering over 10,000 [ 254 ] are recognized as an indigenous people . About a quarter of them speak a Sami language as their mother tongue.

[ 255 ] The Sami languages that are spoken in Finland are Northern Sami , Inari Sami , and Skolt Sami .

[ note 4 ] The rights of minority groups (in particular Sami, Swedish speakers, and Romani people) are protected by the constitution.

[ 1 ] The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland has seen its share of the country's population declining by roughly one percent annually in recent years. The decline has been due to both church membership resignations and falling baptism rates.

[ 264 ] [ 265 ] The second largest group, accounting for 26.3% of the population [ 266 ] in 2017, has no religious affiliation. A small minority belongs to the Finnish Orthodox Church (1.1%). Other Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church are significantly smaller, as are the Jewish and other non-Christian communities (totalling 1.6%). The Pew Research Center estimated the Muslim population at 2.7% in 2016.

[ 267 ] Finland's state church was the Church of Sweden until 1809. As an autonomous Grand Duchy under Russia from 1809 to 1917, Finland retained the Lutheran State Church system, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland was established. After Finland had gained independence in 1917, religious freedom was declared in the constitution of 1919, and a separate law on religious freedom in 1922. Through this arrangement, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland gained a constitutional status as a national church alongside the Finnish Orthodox Church, whose position however is not codified in the constitution. The main Lutheran and Orthodox churches have special roles such as in state ceremonies and schools.

[ 268 ] In 2016, 69.3% of Finnish children were baptized , [ 269 ] but by 2019, this figure had declined to around 62% [ 270 ] and 82.3% were confirmed in 2012 at the age of 15, [ 271 ] and over 90% of the funerals are Christian. However, the majority of Lutherans attend church only for special occasions like Christmas ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. The Lutheran Church estimates that approximately 1.8% of its members attend church services weekly.

[ 273 ] According to a 2010 Eurobarometer poll, 33% of Finnish citizens responded that they "believe there is a God"; 42% answered that they "believe there is some sort of spirit or life force"; and 22% that they "do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force".

[ 274 ] According to ISSP survey data (2008), 8% consider themselves "highly religious", and 31% "moderately religious". In the same survey, 28% reported themselves as "agnostic" and 29% as "non-religious".

[ 277 ] The fertility rate in 2023 stood at 1.26 children born/per woman and has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 since 1969.

[ 278 ] With a low birth rate women also become mothers at a later age, the mean age at first live birth being 30.3 in 2023.

[ 278 ] A 2011 study published in The Lancet medical journal found that Finland had the lowest stillbirth rate out of 193 countries.

[ 279 ] Since 1948, Finland has provided all mothers a maternity package , containing children's clothes and other necessary items. The package seen in the picture is from 2000.

There has been a slight increase or no change in welfare and health inequalities between population groups in the 21st century. Lifestyle-related diseases are on the rise. More than half a million Finns suffer from diabetes , type 1 diabetes being globally the most common in Finland. Many children are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes . The number of musculoskeletal diseases and cancers are increasing, although the cancer prognosis has improved. Allergies and dementia are also growing health problems in Finland. One of the most common reasons for work disability are due to mental disorders, in particular depression .

[ 280 ] Without age standardization , the suicide rates were 13 per 100 000 in 2015, close to the North European average.

[ 281 ] Age-standardized suicide rates are still among the highest among developed countries in the OECD.

In tertiary education, two mostly separate and non-interoperating sectors are found: the profession-oriented polytechnics and the research-oriented universities. Education is free and living expenses are to a large extent financed by the government through student benefits . There are 15 universities and 24 Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) in the country.

[ 175 ] More than 30% of tertiary graduates are in science-related fields. Forest improvement, materials research, environmental sciences, neural networks, low-temperature physics, brain research, biotechnology, genetic technology, and communications showcase fields of study where Finnish researchers have had a significant impact.

[ 301 ] Finland is highly productive in scientific research. In 2005, Finland had the fourth most scientific publications per capita of the OECD countries.

[ 302 ] In 2007, 1,801 patents were filed in Finland.

[ 303 ] Culture Main article: Culture of Finland Literature Main article: Finnish literature Writer and artist Tove Jansson Written Finnish could be said to have existed since Mikael Agricola translated the New Testament into Finnish during the Protestant Reformation , but few notable works of literature were written until the 19th century and the beginning of a Finnish national Romantic Movement . This prompted Elias Lönnrot to collect Finnish and Karelian folk poetry and arrange and publish them as the Kalevala , the Finnish national epic . The era saw a rise of poets and novelists who wrote in Finnish, notably the national writer of Finland, Aleksis Kivi ( The Seven Brothers ), and Minna Canth , Eino Leino , and Juhani Aho . Many writers of the national awakening wrote in Swedish, such as the national poet J. L. Runeberg ( The Tales of Ensign Stål ) and Zachris Topelius .

After Finland became independent, there was a rise of modernist writers , most famously the Swedish-speaking poet Edith Södergran . Finnish-speaking authors explored national and historical themes. Most famous of them were Frans Eemil Sillanpää , who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1939, historical novelist Mika Waltari , and Väinö Linna with his The Unknown Soldier and Under the North Star trilogy . Beginning with Paavo Haavikko , Finnish poetry adopted modernism. Besides Lönnrot's Kalevala and Waltari, the Swedish-speaking Tove Jansson , best known as the creator of The Moomins , is the most translated Finnish writer; [ 304 ] her books have been translated into more than 40 languages.

The best known Finnish painters, Akseli Gallen-Kallela , started painting in a naturalist style but moved to national romanticism. Other notable painters of the era include Pekka Halonen , Eero Järnefelt , Helene Schjerfbeck and Hugo Simberg . In the late 20th century, the homoerotic art of Touko Laaksonen, pseudonym Tom of Finland , found a worldwide audience.

[ 306 ] [ 307 ] Finland's best-known sculptor of the 20th century was Wäinö Aaltonen , remembered for his monumental busts and sculptures. The works of Eila Hiltunen and Laila Pullinen exemplifies the modernism in sculpture.

Finns have made major contributions to handicrafts and industrial design : among the internationally renowned figures are Timo Sarpaneva , Tapio Wirkkala and Ilmari Tapiovaara . Finnish architecture is famous around the world, and has contributed significantly to several styles internationally, such as Jugendstil (or Art Nouveau ), Nordic Classicism and functionalism . Among the top 20th-century Finnish architects to gain international recognition are Eliel Saarinen and his son Eero Saarinen . Architect Alvar Aalto is regarded as among the most important 20th-century designers in the world; [ 308 ] he helped bring functionalist architecture to Finland, but soon was a pioneer in its development towards an organic style.

[ 309 ] Aalto is also famous for his work in furniture, lamps, textiles, and glassware , which were usually incorporated into his buildings.

Music Main articles: Music of Finland and Sami music The kantele is Finland's national and traditional instrument.

Folk Finnish folk music can be divided into Nordic dance music and the older tradition of poem singing, poems from which the national epic, the Kalevala , was created.
Much of Finland's classical music is influenced by traditional Finnish and Karelian melodies and lyrics, as comprised in the Kalevala . In the historical region of Finnish Karelia , as well as other parts of Eastern Finland, the old poem singing traditions were preserved better than in the western parts of the country. In the 19th century Nordic folk dance music largely replaced the kalevaic tradition. Finnish folk music has undergone a roots revival and has become a part of popular music . The people of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, the Sami , are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called joik .

Classical The Finnish composer Jean Sibelius (1865–1957) was a significant figure in the history of classical music .

The first Finnish opera was written by the German-born composer Fredrik Pacius in 1852. Pacius also wrote the music to the poem Maamme/Vårt land (Our Country) , Finland's national anthem . In the 1890s Finnish nationalism based on the Kalevala spread, and Jean Sibelius became famous for his vocal symphony Kullervo . In 1899 he composed Finlandia , which played an important role in Finland gaining independence. He remains one of Finland's most popular national figures.

Alongside Sibelius, the distinct Finnish style of music was created by Oskar Merikanto , Toivo Kuula , Erkki Melartin , Leevi Madetoja and Uuno Klami . Important modernist composers include Einojuhani Rautavaara , Aulis Sallinen and Magnus Lindberg , among others.

Kaija Saariaho was ranked the world's greatest living composer in a 2019 composers' poll.

[ 310 ] Many Finnish musicians have achieved international success. Among them are the conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen , the opera singer Karita Mattila and the violinist Pekka Kuusisto .

Popular music Perttu Kivilaakso of Apocalyptica Iskelmä (coined directly from the German word Schlager , meaning "hit") is a traditional Finnish word for a light popular song. Finnish popular music also includes various kinds of dance music ; tango , a style of Argentine music , is also popular.

[ 311 ] The light music in Swedish-speaking areas has more influences from Sweden. At least a couple of Finnish polkas are known worldwide, such as Säkkijärven polkka [ 312 ] and " Ievan polkka ".

[ 313 ] During the 1970s, progressive rock group Wigwam and rock and roll group Hurriganes gained respect abroad. The Finnish punk scene produced some internationally acknowledged names including Terveet Kädet in the 1980s.

Hanoi Rocks was a pioneering glam rock act.
