Minh-ha Produced by Co-produced by Jean-Paul Bourdier and Trinh T. Minh-ha Release date 1982 ( 1982 ) Running time 40 minutes Countries Senegal United States Language English Reassemblage is a 1982 film by Trinh T. Minh-ha , shot in Senegal picturing the dwellings and everyday life of the Sereer people.

[ 1 ] The first film by the Vietnamese born filmmaker, writer, literary theorist, composer, and professor, Reassemblage focuses especially on the lives of the village women.

[ 2 ] Shot on 16mm film and released in 1982, the film challenges ethnographic documentary conventions (eg.

National Geographic [ 3 ] ) and explores experimental ways of representing native culture.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Minh-ha explains that she intends "not to speak about/Just speak nearby," unlike more conventional ethnographic documentary film. The film is a montage of fleeting images, sounds, and music from Senegal and includes no narration, although there are occasional statements by Trinh T. Minh-ha. None of the statements given by her assign meaning to the scenes, refusing to make the film "about" a "culture". It points to the viewers expectation and the need for the assignment of meaning.

Content [ edit ] Reassemblage does not follow a conventional plot, but rather presents sounds and visuals through non-linear montage. The film consists of a various shots capturing different landscapes, activities, animals, conversations, and people. The accompanying sounds include indigenous music, diegetic sounds and conversations, and a voiceover from Minh-ha. The voiceover does not provide narration or explanation of the scenes, but rather critical reflections on the filmmaking process and ethnographic documentary.
