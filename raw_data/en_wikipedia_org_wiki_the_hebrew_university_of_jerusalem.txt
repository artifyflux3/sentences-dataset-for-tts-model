Co-founded by Albert Einstein and Chaim Weizmann in July 1918, it is the second-oldest institution of higher learning in Israel, having been founded 30 years before the establishment of the State of Israel but six years after the older Technion university.

The university has five affiliated teaching hospitals (including the Hadassah Medical Center ), seven faculties, more than 100 research centers, and 315 academic departments. As of 2018 [update] , one-third of all the doctoral candidates in Israel were studying at the HUJI. The HUJI has three campuses in Jerusalem : one in Rehovot , one in Rishon LeZion and one in Eilat .

[ 5 ] Until 2023, the world's largest library for Jewish studies —the National Library of Israel —was located on its Edmond J. Safra campus in the Givat Ram neighbourhood of Jerusalem.

Among its first board of governors were Sigmund Freud and Martin Buber . Four of Israel's prime ministers are alumni of the university. As of 2018 [update] , 15 Nobel Prize winners (8 alumni and teachers), two Fields Medalists (one alumnus), and three Turing Award winners have been affiliated with the HUJI. It is ranked as the 77th best university in the world.

The AHL replaced in 1953 the Hebrew Language Committee, established in 1890.

A vision of the Zionist movement was the establishment of a Jewish university in the Land of Israel . Founding a university was proposed as far back as 1884 in the Kattowitz (Katowice) conference of the Hovevei Zion society, and by Hermann Schapira at the First Zionist Congress of 1897.

The cornerstone for the university was laid on 24 July 1918. Seven years later, on 1 April 1925, the Hebrew University campus on Mount Scopus was opened at a gala ceremony attended by the leaders of the Jewish world, distinguished scholars and public figures, and British dignitaries, including the Earl of Balfour , Viscount Allenby , Winston Churchill and Sir Herbert Samuel .

[ 7 ] The university's first chancellor was Judah Magnes , who led the school as chancellor from 1924 to 1935.

[ 8 ] In 1935 to 1948 he led the school as president.

[ 8 ] One of the most controversial issues during the conceptualization of the university regarded its future official language. Whereas one side, the so-called "Germanists", proposed a combination of German and Arabic for all non-Jewish subjects, the other side opted for the general use of Hebrew. The former party was afraid the very recent Modern Hebrew might not yet allow high-level academic discussions since it still suffered from a lack of specific technical terms in non-religious contexts. Although this concern can not simply be dismissed as unreasonable, the representatives of this position underestimated the symbolic significance of Hebrew for many Jews, not least of all for those outside the academia. Therefore, they were not able to prevail in the discussion and had to give in to the decision that the new university would be an explicitly Hebrew one.

[ 9 ] The question, what would define the specific Hebrew character of the university did not only regard the choice of an official language but also organizational aspects, as for example the establishment of departments and the definition of their respective research areas, and the outline of its overall academic profile. Therefore, in 1919, Shmaryahu Levin inquired a number of prominent Jewish European scholars about their opinions on the subject. One of the respondents was Ignaz Goldziher whose proposals were at least partly implemented: oriental languages, Jewish literature, and archaeology were among the first subjects studied at the university.

[ 10 ] By 1947, the university had become a large research and teaching institution. Sir Leon Simon was Acting President from 1948 to 1949, and he was succeeded as president by Professor Selig Brodetsky , who served from 1949 to 1952.

[ 8 ] Plans for a medical school were approved in May 1949, and in November 1949, a faculty of law was inaugurated. In 1952, it was announced that the agricultural institute founded by the university in 1940 would become a full-fledged faculty.

[ 11 ] During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War , attacks were carried out against convoys moving between the Israeli-controlled section of Jerusalem and the university.

[ 12 ] The leader of the Arab forces in Jerusalem, Abdul Kader Husseini , threatened military action against the university Hadassah Hospital "if the Jews continued to use them as bases for attacks." [ 13 ] After the April 1948 Hadassah medical convoy massacre , in which 79 Jews, including doctors and nurses, were killed, the Mount Scopus campus was cut off from Jerusalem.

[ 14 ] British soldier Jack Churchill coordinated the evacuation of 700 Jewish doctors, students and patients from the hospital.

[ 15 ] When the Jordanian government denied Israeli access to Mount Scopus, a new campus was built at Givat Ram in western Jerusalem and completed in 1958. In the interim, classes were held in 40 different buildings around the city.

[ 16 ] Benjamin Mazar was President of the university from 1953 to 1961, Giulio Racah was Acting President from 1961 to 1962, and Eliahu Eilat was president from 1962 to 1968.

[ 8 ] The Terra Santa building in Rehavia , rented from the Franciscan Custodians of the Latin Holy Places, was also used for this purpose.

[ 17 ] A few years later, together with the Hadassah Medical Organization, a medical science campus was built in the south-west Jerusalem neighborhood of Ein Kerem .

By the beginning of 1967, the students numbered 12,500, spread among the two campuses in Jerusalem and the agricultural faculty in Rehovot . After the unification of Jerusalem, following the Six-Day War of June 1967, the university was able to return to Mount Scopus, which was rebuilt. According to the Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem , Israel confiscated 568 Dunams of land from the Palestinian village of Isawiya for the Hebrew University in 1968.

[ 18 ] In 1981 the construction work was completed, and Mount Scopus again became the main campus of the university.

[ citation needed ] Avraham Harman was President of the university from 1968 to 1983, Don Patinkin from 1983 to 1986, Amnon Pazy from 1986 to 1990, Yoram Ben-Porat from 1990 to 1992, Hanoch Gutfreund from 1992 to 1997, and Menachem Magidor from 1997 to 2009.

[ 8 ] On 31 July 2002, a member of a terrorist cell detonated a bomb during lunch hour at the university's "Frank Sinatra" cafeteria when it was crowded with staff and students. Nine people—five Israelis, three Americans, and one dual French-American citizen—were murdered and more than 70 wounded. World leaders, including Kofi Annan , President George W. Bush , and the EU's High Representative Javier Solana issued statements of condemnation.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Menachem Ben-Sasson was President of the university from 2009 to 2017, succeeded by Asher Cohen in 2017.

[ 8 ] In 2017 the Hebrew University of Jerusalem launched a marijuana research center, intended to "conduct and coordinate research on cannabis and its biological effects with an eye toward commercial applications." [ 22 ] Campuses Mount Scopus Further information: Mount Scopus § Hebrew University of Jerusalem Mount Scopus campus Mount Scopus campus: Rothberg amphitheater Mount Scopus (Hebrew: Har HaTzofim הר הצופים), in the north-eastern part of Jerusalem, is home to the main campus, which contains the Faculties of Humanities, Social Sciences, Law, Jerusalem School of Business Administration , Seymour Fox School of Education, Baerwald School of Social Work, Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace, Rothberg International School, and the Mandel Institute of Jewish Studies .

The Rothberg International School features secular studies and Jewish/Israeli studies. Included for foreign students is also a mandatory Ulpan program for Hebrew language study which includes a mandatory course in Israeli culture and customs. All Rothberg Ulpan classes are taught by Israeli natives. However, many other classes at the Rothberg School are taught by Jewish immigrants to Israel.

The land on Mt. Scopus was purchased before World War I from Sir John Gray-Hill , along with the Gray-Hill mansion.

[ 23 ] The master plan for the university was designed by Patrick Geddes and his son-in-law, Frank Mears in December 1919. Only two buildings of this original scheme were built: the David Wolffsohn University and National Library, and the Mathematics Institute, with the Physics Institute probably being built to the designs of their Jerusalem-based partner, Benjamin Chaikin.

[ 24 ] Housing for students at Hebrew University who live on Mount Scopus is located at the three dormitories located near the university. These are the Maiersdorf (מאירסדורף) dormitories, the Bronfman (ברונפמן) dormitories, and the Kfar HaStudentim (כפר הסטודנטים, Student Village).

Nearby is the Nicanor Cave , an ancient cave that was planned to be a national pantheon.

Paul Baerwald School of Social Work and Social Welfare The first Bachelor of Social Work in Israel, the school was founded in 1958.  The school was named after Paul Baerwald , a leader of the Jewish Distribution Committee (JDC) . The JDC was an initial funder of the school along with the Ministry of Welfare and the Tel Aviv Municipality .

[ 25 ] A new self-standing building was dedicated on the Givat Ram university campus in April 1967.

[ 26 ] The school has been called "the leader in training and research in the fields of social work and social policy." [ 27 ] It has been ranked the highest rated school of social work in Israel.

[ 28 ] The Master of Social Work was introduced in 1970.

[ 25 ] The school houses the Israel Gerontological Data Center, Nevet- Greenhouse of Context-Informed Research and Training for Children in Need, The Center for the Study of Philanthropy in Israel, The Resilience Research Group.
