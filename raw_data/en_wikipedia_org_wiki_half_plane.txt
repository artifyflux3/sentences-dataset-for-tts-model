Find sources: "Upper half-plane" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( February 2010 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , the upper half-plane , ⁠ H , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}},} ⁠ is the set of points ⁠ ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} ⁠ in the Cartesian plane with ⁠ y > 0.

{\displaystyle y>0.} ⁠ The lower half-plane is the set of points ⁠ ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} ⁠ with ⁠ y < 0 {\displaystyle y<0} ⁠ instead. Arbitrary oriented half-planes can be obtained via a planar rotation . Half-planes are an example of two-dimensional half-space . A half-plane can be split in two quadrants .

Affine geometry [ edit ] The affine transformations of the upper half-plane include shifts ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ ( x + c , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto (x+c,y)} , c ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle c\in \mathbb {R} } , and dilations ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ ( λ λ x , λ λ y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto (\lambda x,\lambda y)} , λ λ > 0.

{\displaystyle \lambda >0.} Proposition: Let ⁠ A {\displaystyle A} ⁠ and ⁠ B {\displaystyle B} ⁠ be semicircles in the upper half-plane with centers on the boundary. Then there is an affine mapping that takes A {\displaystyle A} to B {\displaystyle B} .

Proof: First shift the center of ⁠ A {\displaystyle A} ⁠ to ⁠ ( 0 , 0 ) .

{\displaystyle (0,0).} ⁠ Then take λ λ = ( diameter of B ) / ( diameter of A ) {\displaystyle \lambda =({\text{diameter of}}\ B)/({\text{diameter of}}\ A)} and dilate. Then shift ⁠ ( 0 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (0,0)} ⁠ to the center of ⁠ B .

{\displaystyle B.} ⁠ Inversive geometry [ edit ] Definition: Z := { ( cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ , 1 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ 2 θ θ ) ∣ ∣ 0 < θ θ < π π } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {Z}}:=\left\{\left(\cos ^{2}\theta ,{\tfrac {1}{2}}\sin 2\theta \right)\mid 0<\theta <\pi \right\}} .

⁠ Z {\displaystyle {\mathcal {Z}}} ⁠ can be recognized as the circle of radius ⁠ 1 2 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}} ⁠ centered at ⁠ ( 1 2 , 0 ) , {\displaystyle {\bigl (}{\tfrac {1}{2}},0{\bigr )},} ⁠ and as the polar plot of ρ ρ ( θ θ ) = cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ .

{\displaystyle \rho (\theta )=\cos \theta .} Proposition: ⁠ ( 0 , 0 ) , {\displaystyle (0,0),} ⁠ ⁠ ρ ρ ( θ θ ) {\displaystyle \rho (\theta )} ⁠ in ⁠ Z , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {Z}},} ⁠ and ⁠ ( 1 , tan ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) {\displaystyle (1,\tan \theta )} ⁠ are collinear points .

In fact, Z {\displaystyle {\mathcal {Z}}} is the inversion of the line { ( 1 , y ) ∣ ∣ y > 0 } {\displaystyle {\bigl \{}(1,y)\mid y>0{\bigr \}}} in the unit circle . Indeed, the diagonal from ⁠ ( 0 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (0,0)} ⁠ to ⁠ ( 1 , tan ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) {\displaystyle (1,\tan \theta )} ⁠ has squared length 1 + tan 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ = sec 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle 1+\tan ^{2}\theta =\sec ^{2}\theta } , so that ρ ρ ( θ θ ) = cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle \rho (\theta )=\cos \theta } is the reciprocal of that length.

Metric geometry [ edit ] The distance between any two points ⁠ p {\displaystyle p} ⁠ and ⁠ q {\displaystyle q} ⁠ in the upper half-plane can be consistently defined as follows: The perpendicular bisector of the segment from ⁠ p {\displaystyle p} ⁠ to ⁠ q {\displaystyle q} ⁠ either intersects the boundary or is parallel to it. In the latter case ⁠ p {\displaystyle p} ⁠ and ⁠ q {\displaystyle q} ⁠ lie on a ray perpendicular to the boundary and logarithmic measure can be used to define a distance that is invariant under dilation. In the former case ⁠ p {\displaystyle p} ⁠ and ⁠ q {\displaystyle q} ⁠ lie on a circle centered at the intersection of their perpendicular bisector and the boundary. By the above proposition this circle can be moved by affine motion to ⁠ Z .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {Z}}.} ⁠ Distances on ⁠ Z {\displaystyle {\mathcal {Z}}} ⁠ can be defined using the correspondence with points on { ( 1 , y ) ∣ ∣ y > 0 } {\displaystyle {\bigl \{}(1,y)\mid y>0{\bigr \}}} and logarithmic measure on this ray. In consequence, the upper half-plane becomes a metric space . The generic name of this metric space is the hyperbolic plane . In terms of the models of hyperbolic geometry , this model is frequently designated the Poincaré half-plane model .

Complex plane [ edit ] Mathematicians sometimes identify the Cartesian plane with the complex plane , and then the upper half-plane corresponds to the set of complex numbers with positive imaginary part : H := { x + i y ∣ ∣ y > 0 ; x , y ∈ ∈ R } .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}:=\{x+iy\mid y>0;\ x,y\in \mathbb {R} \}.} The term arises from a common visualization of the complex number x + i y {\displaystyle x+iy} as the point ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} in the plane endowed with Cartesian coordinates . When the y {\displaystyle y} axis is oriented vertically, the "upper half-plane " corresponds to the region above the x {\displaystyle x} axis and thus complex numbers for which y > 0 {\displaystyle y>0} .

It is the domain of many functions of interest in complex analysis , especially modular forms . The lower half-plane, defined by ⁠ y < 0 {\displaystyle y<0} ⁠ is equally good, but less used by convention. The open unit disk ⁠ D {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}} ⁠ (the set of all complex numbers of absolute value less than one) is equivalent by a conformal mapping to ⁠ H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} ⁠ (see " Poincaré metric "), meaning that it is usually possible to pass between ⁠ H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} ⁠ and ⁠ D .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}.} ⁠ It also plays an important role in hyperbolic geometry , where the Poincaré half-plane model provides a way of examining hyperbolic motions . The Poincaré metric provides a hyperbolic metric on the space.

The uniformization theorem for surfaces states that the upper half-plane is the universal covering space of surfaces with constant negative Gaussian curvature .

The closed upper half-plane is the union of the upper half-plane and the real axis. It is the closure of the upper half-plane.

Generalizations [ edit ] One natural generalization in differential geometry is hyperbolic n {\displaystyle n} -space ⁠ H n , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}^{n},} ⁠ the maximally symmetric, simply connected , ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ -dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature − − 1 {\displaystyle -1} . In this terminology, the upper half-plane is ⁠ H 2 {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}^{2}} ⁠ since it has real dimension ⁠ 2.

{\displaystyle 2.} ⁠ In number theory , the theory of Hilbert modular forms is concerned with the study of certain functions on the direct product ⁠ H n {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}^{n}} ⁠ of ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ copies of the upper half-plane. Yet another space interesting to number theorists is the Siegel upper half-space ⁠ H n , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}_{n},} ⁠ which is the domain of Siegel modular forms .
