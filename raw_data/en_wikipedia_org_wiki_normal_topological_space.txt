In [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") and related branches of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **normal space** is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") in which any two disjoint [closed sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set "Closed set") have disjoint [open neighborhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_neighborhood "Open neighborhood"). Such spaces need not be [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space") in general. A normal Hausdorff space is called a **T 4 space**. Strengthenings of these concepts are detailed in the article below and include **completely normal spaces** and **perfectly normal spaces**, and their Hausdorff variants: **T 5 spaces** and **T 6 spaces**. All these conditions are examples of [separation axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_axiom "Separation axiom").

A [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space")_X_ is a **normal space** if, given any [disjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets "Disjoint sets")[closed sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set "Closed set")_E_ and _F_, there are [neighbourhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(topology) "Neighbourhood (topology)")_U_ of _E_ and _V_ of _F_ that are also disjoint. More intuitively, this condition says that _E_ and _F_ can be [separated by neighbourhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separated_set "Separated set").

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Normal_space.svg/250px-Normal_space.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Normal_space.svg)

The closed sets _E_ and _F_, here represented by closed disks on opposite sides of the picture, are separated by their respective neighbourhoods _U_ and _V_, here represented by larger, but still disjoint, open disks.

A **T 4 space** is a [T 1 space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T1_space "T1 space")_X_ that is normal; this is equivalent to _X_ being normal and [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space").

A **completely normal space**, or **hereditarily normal space**, is a topological space _X_ such that every [subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspace_(topology) "Subspace (topology)") of _X_ is a normal space. It turns out that _X_ is completely normal if and only if every two [separated sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separated_set "Separated set") can be separated by neighbourhoods. Also, _X_ is completely normal if and only if every open subset of _X_ is normal with the subspace topology.

A **T 5 space**, or **completely T 4 space**, is a completely normal T 1 space _X_, which implies that _X_ is Hausdorff; equivalently, every subspace of _X_ must be a T 4 space.

A **perfectly normal space** is a topological space ![Image 2: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) in which every two disjoint closed sets ![Image 3: {\displaystyle E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b) and ![Image 4: {\displaystyle F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57) can be [precisely separated by a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precisely_separated_by_a_function "Precisely separated by a function"), in the sense that there is a continuous function ![Image 5: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) from ![Image 6: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) to the interval ![Image 7: {\displaystyle [0,1]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/738f7d23bb2d9642bab520020873cccbef49768d) such that ![Image 8: {\displaystyle f^{-1}(\{0\})=E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8c573ec4836391d0abbbfa05494ff72e22a7ff17) and ![Image 9: {\displaystyle f^{-1}(\{1\})=F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b38a095f58bd449119363bed61a3610f765ac5b).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_topological_space#cite_note-1) This is a stronger separation property than normality, as by [Urysohn's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urysohn%27s_lemma "Urysohn's lemma") disjoint closed sets in a normal space can be [separated by a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separated_by_a_function "Separated by a function"), in the sense of ![Image 10: {\displaystyle E\subseteq f^{-1}(\{0\})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1efd6834b40057c06096bf26c46f896953c229ca) and ![Image 11: {\displaystyle F\subseteq f^{-1}(\{1\})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6351361b8d0127e03b92fd550a608848db7a7408), but not precisely separated in general. It turns out that _X_ is perfectly normal if and only if _X_ is normal and every closed set is a [G δ set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-delta_set "G-delta set"). Equivalently, _X_ is perfectly normal if and only if every closed set is the [zero set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_set "Zero set") of a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"). The equivalence between these three characterizations is called **Vedenissoff's theorem**.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_topological_space#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_topological_space#cite_note-3) Every perfectly normal space is completely normal, because perfect normality is a [hereditary property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_property "Hereditary property").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_topological_space#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_topological_space#cite_note-Munkres_p213-5)

A **T 6 space**, or **perfectly T 4 space**, is a perfectly normal Hausdorff space.

Note that the terms "normal space" and "T 4" and derived concepts occasionally have a different meaning. (Nonetheless, "T 5" always means the same as "completely T 4", whatever the meaning of T 4 may be.) The definitions given here are the ones usually used today. For more on this issue, see [History of the separation axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_separation_axioms "History of the separation axioms").

Terms like "normal [regular space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_space "Regular space")" and "normal Hausdorff space" also turn up in the literature—they simply mean that the space both is normal and satisfies the other condition mentioned. In particular, a normal Hausdorff space is the same thing as a T 4 space. Given the historical confusion of the meaning of the terms, verbal descriptions when applicable are helpful, that is, "normal Hausdorff" instead of "T 4", or "completely normal Hausdorff" instead of "T 5".

[Fully normal spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_normal_space "Fully normal space") and [fully T 4 spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracompact_Hausdorff_space "Paracompact Hausdorff space") are discussed elsewhere; they are related to [paracompactness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracompactness "Paracompactness").

A [locally normal space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_normal_space "Locally normal space") is a topological space where every point has an open neighbourhood that is normal. Every normal space is locally normal, but the converse is not true. A classical example of a completely regular locally normal space that is not normal is the [Nemytskii plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemytskii_plane "Nemytskii plane").

Examples of normal spaces
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Normal_space&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Examples of normal spaces")]

Most spaces encountered in [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis") are normal Hausdorff spaces, or at least normal regular spaces:

*   All [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_spaces "Metric spaces") (and hence all [metrizable spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrizable_space "Metrizable space")) are perfectly normal Hausdorff;
*   All [pseudometric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudometric_space "Pseudometric space") (and hence all [pseudometrizable spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudometrizable_space "Pseudometrizable space")) are perfectly normal regular, although not in general Hausdorff;
*   All [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") Hausdorff spaces are normal;
*   In particular, the [Stone–Čech compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93%C4%8Cech_compactification "Stone–Čech compactification") of a [Tychonoff space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonoff_space "Tychonoff space") is normal Hausdorff;
*   Generalizing the above examples, all [paracompact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracompact "Paracompact") Hausdorff spaces are normal, and all paracompact regular spaces are normal;
*   All paracompact [topological manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_manifold "Topological manifold") are perfectly normal Hausdorff. However, there exist non-paracompact manifolds that are not even normal.
*   All [order topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_topology "Order topology") on [totally ordered sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totally_ordered_set "Totally ordered set") are hereditarily normal and Hausdorff.
*   Every regular [second-countable space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-countable_space "Second-countable space") is completely normal, and every regular [Lindelöf space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindel%C3%B6f_space "Lindelöf space") is normal.

Also, all [fully normal spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_normal_space "Fully normal space") are normal (even if not regular). [Sierpiński space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_space "Sierpiński space") is an example of a normal space that is not regular.

Examples of non-normal spaces
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Normal_space&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Examples of non-normal spaces")]

An important example of a non-normal topology is given by the [Zariski topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_topology "Zariski topology") on an [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") or on the [spectrum of a ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_a_ring "Spectrum of a ring"), which is used in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry").

A non-normal space of some relevance to analysis is the [topological vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector_space "Topological vector space") of all [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") from the [real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line")**R** to itself, with the [topology of pointwise convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_of_pointwise_convergence "Topology of pointwise convergence"). More generally, a theorem of [Arthur Harold Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Harold_Stone "Arthur Harold Stone") states that the [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_topology "Product topology") of [uncountably many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable "Uncountable") non-[compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") metric spaces is never normal.

Every closed subset of a normal space is normal. The continuous and closed image of a normal space is normal.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_topological_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWillard1970[httpsarchiveorgdetailsgeneraltopology00will_0page100_100%E2%80%93101]-6)

The main significance of normal spaces lies in the fact that they admit "enough" [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function_(topology) "Continuous function (topology)")[real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")-valued [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)"), as expressed by the following theorems valid for any normal space _X_.

[Urysohn's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urysohn%27s_lemma "Urysohn's lemma"): If _A_ and _B_ are two [disjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets "Disjoint sets") closed subsets of _X_, then there exists a continuous function _f_ from _X_ to the real line **R** such that _f_(_x_) = 0 for all _x_ in _A_ and _f_(_x_) = 1 for all _x_ in _B_. In fact, we can take the values of _f_ to be entirely within the [unit interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_interval "Unit interval") [0,1]. In fancier terms, disjoint closed sets are not only separated by neighbourhoods, but also [separated by a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separated_by_a_function "Separated by a function").

More generally, the [Tietze extension theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tietze_extension_theorem "Tietze extension theorem"): If _A_ is a closed subset of _X_ and _f_ is a continuous function from _A_ to **R**, then there exists a continuous function _F_: _X_ → **R** that extends _f_ in the sense that _F_(_x_) = _f_(_x_) for all _x_ in _A_.

The map _![Image 12: {\displaystyle \emptyset \rightarrow X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/0824e51cce520be5752b00c0d65587ba3bf164a0)_ has the [lifting property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_property "Lifting property") with respect to a map from a certain finite topological space with five points (two open and three closed) to the space with one open and two closed points.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_topological_space#cite_note-7)

If **U** is a locally finite [open cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cover "Open cover") of a normal space _X_, then there is a [partition of unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_unity "Partition of unity") precisely subordinate to **U**. This shows the relationship of normal spaces to [paracompactness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracompactness "Paracompactness").

In fact, any space that satisfies any one of these three conditions must be normal.

A [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_space "Product space") of normal spaces is not necessarily normal. This fact was first proved by [Robert Sorgenfrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sorgenfrey "Robert Sorgenfrey"). An example of this phenomenon is the [Sorgenfrey plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorgenfrey_plane "Sorgenfrey plane"). In fact, since there exist spaces which are [Dowker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowker_space "Dowker space"), a product of a normal space and [0, 1] need not to be normal. Also, a subset of a normal space need not be normal (i.e. not every normal Hausdorff space is a completely normal Hausdorff space), since every Tychonoff space is a subset of its Stone–Čech compactification (which is normal Hausdorff). A more explicit example is the [Tychonoff plank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonoff_plank "Tychonoff plank"). The only large class of product spaces of normal spaces known to be normal are the products of compact Hausdorff spaces, since both compactness ([Tychonoff's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonoff%27s_theorem "Tychonoff's theorem")) and the T 2 axiom are preserved under arbitrary products.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_topological_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWillard1970Section_17-8)

Relationships to other separation axioms
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Normal_space&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Relationships to other separation axioms")]

If a normal space is [R 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R0_space "R0 space"), then it is in fact [completely regular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_regular "Completely regular"). Thus, anything from "normal R 0" to "normal completely regular" is the same as what we usually call _normal regular_. Taking [Kolmogorov quotients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_quotient "Kolmogorov quotient"), we see that all normal [T 1 spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T1_space "T1 space") are [Tychonoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonoff_space "Tychonoff space"). These are what we usually call _normal Hausdorff_ spaces.

A topological space is said to be [pseudonormal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonormal_space "Pseudonormal space") if given two disjoint closed sets in it, one of which is countable, there are disjoint open sets containing them. Every normal space is pseudonormal, but not vice versa.

Counterexamples to some variations on these statements can be found in the lists above. Specifically, [Sierpiński space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_space "Sierpiński space") is normal but not regular, while the space of functions from **R** to itself is Tychonoff but not normal.
