With headquarters located in Murray Hill, New Jersey , the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world.

As a former subsidiary of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T), Bell Labs and its researchers have been credited with the development of radio astronomy , the transistor , the laser , the photovoltaic cell , the charge-coupled device (CCD), information theory , the Unix operating system, and the programming languages B , C , C++ , S , SNOBOL , AWK , AMPL , and others, throughout the 20th century. Eleven Nobel Prizes and five Turing Awards have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories.

[ 1 ] Bell Labs had its origin in the complex corporate organization of the Bell System telephone conglomerate. The laboratory began operating in the late 19th century as the Western Electric Engineering Department, located at 463 West Street in New York City. After years of advancing telecommunication innovations, the department was reformed into Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1925 and placed under the shared ownership of Western Electric and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. In the 1960s, laboratory and company headquarters were moved to Murray Hill, New Jersey.

Its alumni during this time include a plethora of world-renowned scientists and engineers.

With the breakup of the Bell System , Bell Labs became a subsidiary of AT&T Technologies in 1984, which resulted in a drastic decline in its funding.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In 1996, AT&T spun off AT&T Technologies, which was renamed to Lucent Technologies , using the Murray Hill site for headquarters. Bell Laboratories was split with AT&T retaining parts as AT&T Laboratories . In 2006, Lucent merged with French telecommunication company Alcatel to form Alcatel-Lucent , which was acquired by Nokia in 2016.

Origin and historical locations [ edit ] Bell's personal research after the telephone [ edit ] Bell's 1893 Volta Bureau building in Washington, D.C.

In 1880, when the French government awarded Alexander Graham Bell the Volta Prize of 50,000 francs for the invention of the telephone (equivalent to about US$10,000 at the time, or about $340,000 now), [ 4 ] he used the award to fund the Volta Laboratory (also known as the "Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory") in Washington, D.C.

in collaboration with Sumner Tainter and Bell's cousin Chichester Bell .

[ 5 ] The laboratory was variously known as the Volta Bureau , the Bell Carriage House , the Bell Laboratory and the Volta Laboratory .

It focused on the analysis, recording, and transmission of sound. Bell used his considerable profits from the laboratory for further research and education advancing the diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf.

[ 5 ] This resulted in the founding of the Volta Bureau ( c.

1887 ) at the Washington, D.C. home of his father, linguist Alexander Melville Bell . The carriage house there, at 1527 35th Street N.W., became their headquarters in 1889.

[ 5 ] In 1893, Bell constructed a new building close by at 1537 35th Street N.W., specifically to house the lab.

[ 5 ] This building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] After the invention of the telephone, Bell maintained a relatively distant role with the Bell System as a whole, but continued to pursue his own personal research interests.

[ 9 ] Early antecedent [ edit ] The Bell Patent Association was formed by Alexander Graham Bell , Thomas Sanders, and Gardiner Hubbard when filing the first patents for the telephone in 1876.

Bell Telephone Company, the first telephone company, was formed a year later. It later became a part of the American Bell Telephone Company.

In 1884, the American Bell Telephone Company created the Mechanical Department from the Electrical and Patent Department formed a year earlier.

The American Telephone and Telegraph Company and its own subsidiary company took control of American Bell and the Bell System by 1899.

American Bell held a controlling interest in Western Electric (which was the manufacturing arm of the business) whereas AT&T was doing research into the service providers.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Formal organization and location changes [ edit ] The Bell Laboratories Building , built at 463 West Street in New York City in 1925 In 1896, Western Electric bought property at 463 West Street to centralize the manufacturers and engineers which had been supplying AT&T with such technology as telephones, telephone exchange switches and transmission equipment.

During the early 20th century, several historically significant laboratories were established. In 1915, the first radio transmissions were made from a shack in Montauk, Long Island . That same year, tests were performed on the first transoceanic radio telephone at a house in Arlington County, Virginia .  A radio reception laboratory was established in 1919 in the Cliffwood section of Aberdeen Township, New Jersey . Additionally for 1919, a transmission studies site was established in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania that built, in 1929, the coaxial conductor line for first tests of long-distance transmission in various frequencies.

[ 12 ] On January 1, 1925, Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. was organized to consolidate the development and research activities in the communication field and allied sciences for the Bell System. Ownership was evenly shared between Western Electric and AT&T. The new company had 3600 engineers, scientists, and support staff. Its 400,000-square-foot (37,000 m 2 ) space was expanded with a new building occupying about one quarter of a city block.

[ 13 ] The first chairman of the board of directors was John J. Carty , AT&T's vice president, and the first president was Frank B. Jewett , [ 13 ] also a board member, who stayed there until 1940.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] The operations were directed by E. B. Craft, executive vice-president, and formerly chief engineer at Western Electric.

In the early 1920s, a few outdoor facilities and radio communications development facilities were developed. In 1925, the test plot studies were established at Gulfport, Mississippi , where there were numerous telephone pole samples established for wood preservation. At the Deal, New Jersey location, work was done on ship-to-shore radio telephony. In 1926, in the Whippany section of Hanover Township, New Jersey , land was acquired and established for the development of a 50-kilowatt broadcast transmitter. In 1931, Whippany increased with 75 acres (30 ha) added from a nearby property. In 1928, a 15-acre (6.1 ha) site in Chester Township, New Jersey , was leased for outdoor tests, though the facility became inadequate for such purposes. In 1930, the Chester location required the purchase of an additional 85 acres (34 ha) of land to be used for a new outdoor plant development laboratory. Prior to Chester being established, a test plot was installed in Limon, Colorado in 1929, similar to the one in Gulfport. The three test plots at Gulfport, Limon, and Chester were outdoor facilities for preservatives and prolonging the use of telephone poles. Additionally, in 1929, a land expansion was done at the Deal Labs to 208 acres (84 ha). This added land increased the facility for radio transmission studies.

[ 17 ] The beginning of 1930s, established three facilities with radio communications experiments and chemical aspects testing. By 1939, the Summit, New Jersey , chemical laboratory was nearly 10 years established in a three-story building conducted experiments in corrosion, using various fungicides tests on cables, metallic components, or wood. For 1929, land was purchased in Holmdel Township, New Jersey , for a radio reception laboratory to replace the Cliffwood location that had been in operation since 1919. In 1930, the Cliffwood location was ending its operations as Holmdel was established. Whereas, in 1930, a location in Mendham Township, New Jersey , was established to continue radio receiver developments farther from the Whippany location and eliminate transmitter interference at that facility with developments. The Mendham location worked on communication equipment and broadcast receivers. These devices were used for marine, aircraft, and police services as well as the location performed precision frequency-measuring apparatus, field strength measurements, and conducted radio interference.

[ 18 ] By the early 1940s, Bell Labs engineers and scientists had begun to move to other locations away from the congestion and environmental distractions of New York City, and in 1967 Bell Laboratories headquarters was officially relocated to Murray Hill, New Jersey .

Among the later Bell Laboratories locations in New Jersey were Holmdel Township , Crawford Hill , the Deal Test Site , Freehold , Lincroft , Long Branch , Middletown , Neptune Township , Princeton , Piscataway , Red Bank , Chester Township , and Whippany . Of these, Murray Hill and Crawford Hill remain in existence (the Piscataway and Red Bank locations were transferred to and are now operated by Telcordia Technologies and the Whippany site was purchased by Bayer [ 19 ] ).

The largest grouping of people in the company was in Illinois , at Naperville - Lisle , in the Chicago area, which had the largest concentration of employees (about 11,000) prior to 2001. There also were groups of employees in Indianapolis , Indiana; Columbus, Ohio ; North Andover, Massachusetts ; Allentown, Pennsylvania ; Reading, Pennsylvania ; and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania ; Burlington, North Carolina (1950s–1970s, moved to Greensboro 1980s) and Westminster, Colorado . Since 2001, many of the former locations have been scaled down or closed.

The Old Bell Labs Holmdel Complex , located about 20 miles south of New York City, in New Jersey Bell's Holmdel research and development lab , a 1,900,000-square-foot (180,000 m 2 ) structure set on 473 acres (191 ha), was closed in 2007. The mirrored-glass building was designed by Eero Saarinen . In August 2013, Somerset Development bought the building, intending to redevelop it into a mixed commercial and residential project. A 2012 article expressed doubt on the success of the newly named Bell Works site, [ 20 ] but several large tenants had announced plans to move in through 2016 and 2017.

( December 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Bell Laboratories was, and is, regarded by many as the premier research facility of its type, developing a wide range of revolutionary technologies, including radio astronomy , the transistor , the laser , information theory , the operating system Unix , the programming languages C and C++ , solar cells , the charge-coupled device (CCD), and many other optical, wireless, and wired communications technologies and systems.

1920s [ edit ] In 1924, Bell Labs physicist Walter A. Shewhart proposed the control chart as a method to determine when a process was in a state of statistical control. Shewhart's methods were the basis for statistical process control (SPC): the use of statistically based tools and techniques to manage and improve processes. This was the origin of the modern quality control movement, including Six Sigma .

In 1926, the laboratories invented an early synchronous-sound motion picture system, in competition with Fox Movietone and DeForest Phonofilm .

[ 40 ] In 1927, a Bell team headed by Herbert E. Ives successfully transmitted long-distance 128-line television images of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover from Washington to New York. In 1928 the thermal noise in a resistor was first measured by John B. Johnson , for which Harry Nyquist provided the theoretical analysis; this is now termed Johnson-Nyquist noise . During the 1920s, the one-time pad cipher was invented by Gilbert Vernam and Joseph Mauborgne at the laboratories. Bell Labs' Claude Shannon later proved that it is unbreakable.

In 1928, Harold Black invented the negative feedback system commonly used in amplifiers. Later, Harry Nyquist analyzed Black's design rule for negative feedback. This work was published in 1932 and became known as the Nyquist criterion .

1930s [ edit ] Reconstruction of the directional antenna used in the discovery of radio emission of extraterrestrial origin by Karl Guthe Jansky at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1932 In 1931, a foundation for radio astronomy was laid by Karl Jansky during his work investigating the origins of static on long-distance shortwave communications . He discovered that radio waves were being emitted from the center of the galaxy .

In 1931 and 1932, the labs made experimental high fidelity, long playing, and even stereophonic recordings of the Philadelphia Orchestra , conducted by Leopold Stokowski .

[ 41 ] In 1933, stereo signals were transmitted live from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C.

In 1937, the vocoder , an electronic speech compression device, or codec, and the Voder , the first electronic speech synthesizer , were developed and demonstrated by Homer Dudley , the Voder being demonstrated at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Bell researcher Clinton Davisson shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with George Paget Thomson for the discovery of electron diffraction , which helped lay the foundation for solid-state electronics .

1940s [ edit ] A replica of the first transistor , a point-contact germanium device, invented at Bell Laboratories in 1947 In the early 1940s, the photovoltaic cell was developed by Russell Ohl . In 1943, Bell developed SIGSALY , the first digital scrambled speech transmission system, used by the Allies in World War II . The British wartime codebreaker Alan Turing visited the labs at this time, working on speech encryption and meeting Claude Shannon .

[ 42 ] Bell Labs Quality Assurance Department gave the world and the United States such statisticians as Walter A. Shewhart , W. Edwards Deming , Harold F. Dodge , George D. Edwards , Harry Romig, R. L. Jones, Paul Olmstead, E.G.D. Paterson, and Mary N. Torrey . During World War II, Emergency Technical Committee – Quality Control, drawn mainly from Bell Labs' statisticians, was instrumental in advancing Army and Navy ammunition acceptance and material sampling procedures.

In 1947, the transistor , arguably the most important invention developed by Bell Laboratories, was invented by John Bardeen , Walter Houser Brattain , and William Bradford Shockley (who subsequently shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956). In 1947, Richard Hamming invented Hamming codes for error detection and correction . For patent reasons, the result was not published until 1950.

In 1948, " A Mathematical Theory of Communication ", one of the founding works in information theory , was published by Claude Shannon in the Bell System Technical Journal . It built in part on earlier work in the field by Bell researchers Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley , but went much further. Bell Labs also introduced a series of increasingly complex calculators through the decade. Shannon was also the founder of modern cryptography with his 1949 paper Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems .

Calculators [ edit ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Model I: A complex number calculator , completed in 1939 and put into operation in 1940, for doing calculations of complex numbers .

Model II: Relay Computer / Relay Interpolator, [ 45 ] September 1943, for interpolating data points of flight profiles (needed for performance testing of a gun director).

[ 46 ] This model introduced error detection (self checking).

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] Model III: Ballistic Computer, [ 49 ] [ 50 ] June 1944, for calculations of ballistic trajectories.

Model IV: Error Detector Mark II, March 1945, [ 51 ] an improved ballistic computer.

Model V : [ 52 ] General-purpose electromechanical computer, of which two were built, July 1946 and February 1947 [ 53 ] [ 51 ] [ 54 ] Model VI : 1949, an enhanced Model V.

The central development was binary code systems. Efforts concentrated on the prime mission of supporting the Bell System with engineering advances, including the N-carrier system, TD microwave radio relay , direct distance dialing , E- repeater , wire spring relay , and the Number Five Crossbar Switching System .

In 1952, William Gardner Pfann revealed the method of zone melting , which enabled semiconductor purification and level doping.

In 1953, Maurice Karnaugh developed the Karnaugh map , used for managing of Boolean algebraic expressions.

In January 1954, Bell Labs built one of the first completely transistorized computer machines, [ 55 ] TRADIC or Flyable TRADIC, [ 56 ] for the United States Air Force with 10,358 germanium point-contact diodes and 684 Bell Labs Type 1734 Type A cartridge transistors.

[ citation needed ] The design team was led by electrical engineer Jean Howard Felker with James R. Harris and Louis C. Brown ("Charlie Brown") as the lead engineers on the project, which started in 1951.

[ 57 ] The device took only 3 cubic-feet and consumed 100 watt power for its small and low powered design in comparison to the vacuum tube designs of the times. The device could be installed in a B-52 Stratofortress Bomber and had a performance up to one million logical operations a second. The flyable program used a Mylar sheet with punched holes, instead of the removable plugboard.

[ 58 ] In 1954, the first modern solar cell was invented at Bell Laboratories.

In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick discovered semiconductor surface passivation by silicon dioxide.

[ 59 ] In 1956 TAT-1 , the first transatlantic communications cable to carry telephone conversations, was laid between Scotland and Newfoundland in a joint effort by AT&T, Bell Laboratories, and British and Canadian telephone companies.

In 1957, Max Mathews created MUSIC , one of the first computer programs to play electronic music .

Robert C. Prim and Joseph Kruskal developed new greedy algorithms that revolutionized computer network design .

In 1957 Frosch and Derick, using masking and predeposition, were able to manufacture silicon dioxide field effect transistors; the first planar transistors, in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface. They showed that silicon dioxide insulated, protected silicon wafers and prevented dopants from diffusing into the wafer.

[ 60 ] In 1958, a technical paper by Arthur Schawlow and Charles Hard Townes first described the laser .

Following Frosch and Derick research, Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng proposed a silicon MOS transistor in 1959 [ 61 ] and successfully demonstrated a working MOS device with their Bell Labs team in 1960.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Their team included E. E. LaBate and E. I. Povilonis who fabricated the device; M. O. Thurston, L. A. D’Asaro, and J. R. Ligenza who developed the diffusion processes, and H. K. Gummel and R. Lindner who characterized the device.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] K. E. Daburlos and H. J. Patterson of Bell Laboratories continued on the work of C. Frosch and L. Derick, and developed a process similar to Hoerni's planar process about the same time.

[ 66 ] J.R. Ligenza and W.G. Spitzer studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides, fabricated a high quality Si/ SiO 2 stack and published their results in 1960.

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] 1960s [ edit ] On October 1, 1960, the Kwajalein Field Station was announced as a location for the Nike Zeus test program. Mr. R. W. Benfer was the first director to arrive shortly on October 5 for the program. Bell Labs designed many of the major system elements and conducted fundamental investigations of phase-controlled scanning antenna arrays.

[ 70 ] The patent for the electret microphone, an invention by Gerhard Sessler and James West Logo used from 1969 until 1983, featuring the icon designed by Saul Bass In December 1960, Ali Javan , PhD physicist from the University of Tehran, Iran with help by Rolf Seebach and his associates William Bennett and Donald Heriot, successfully operated the first gas laser , the first continuous-light laser, operating at an unprecedented accuracy and color purity.

In 1962, the electret microphone was invented by Gerhard M. Sessler and James E. West . Also in 1962, John R. Pierce 's vision of communications satellites was realized by the launch of Telstar .

On July 10, 1962, the Telstar spacecraft was launched into orbit by NASA and it was designed and built by Bell Laboratories. The first worldwide television broadcast was July 23, 1962 with a press conference by President Kennedy.

[ 71 ] In Spring 1964, the building of an electronic switching systems center was planned at Bell Laboratories near Naperville, Illinois. The building in 1966 would be called Indian Hill, and development work from former electronic switching organization at Holmdel and Systems Equipment Engineering organization would occupy the laboratory with engineers from Western Electric Hawthorne Works. Scheduled for work were about 1,200 people when completed in 1966, and peaked at 11,000 before October 2001 Lucent Technologies downsizing occurred.

[ 72 ] In 1964, the carbon dioxide laser was invented by Kumar Patel and the discovery/operation of the Nd:YAG laser was demonstrated by Joseph E. Geusic et al.

Experiments by Myriam Sarachik provided the first data that confirmed the Kondo effect .

[ 73 ] The research of Philip W. Anderson into electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems led to improved understanding of metals and insulators for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1977.

[ 74 ] In 1965, Penzias and Wilson discovered the cosmic microwave background , for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978.

[ 75 ] Frank W. Sinden, Edward E. Zajac, Ken Knowlton , and A. Michael Noll made computer-animated movies during the early to mid-1960s.

In 1969, Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson created the computer operating system UNIX for the support of telecommunication switching systems as well as general-purpose computing. Also, in 1969, the charge-coupled device (CCD) was invented by Willard Boyle and George E. Smith , for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.

From 1969 to 1971, Aaron Marcus , the first graphic designer involved with computer graphics, researched, designed, and programmed a prototype interactive page-layout system for the Picturephone.

1970s [ edit ] The C programming language was developed in 1972.

The 1970s and 1980s saw more and more computer-related inventions at the Bell Laboratories as part of the personal computing revolution.

In the 1970s, major central office technology evolved from crossbar electromechanical relay-based technology and discrete transistor logic to Bell Labs-developed thick film hybrid and transistor–transistor logic (TTL), stored program-controlled switching systems; 1A / #4 TOLL Electronic Switching Systems (ESS) and 2A Local Central Offices produced at the Bell Labs Naperville and Western Electric Lisle, Illinois facilities. This technology evolution dramatically reduced floor space needs. The new ESS also came with its own diagnostic software that needed only a switchman and several frame technicians to maintain.

About 1970, the coax-22 cable was developed by Bell Labs. This coax cable with 22 strands had a total capacity of 132,000 telephone calls. Previously, a 12-strand coax cable was used for L-carrier systems. Both of these types of cables were manufactured at Western Electrics' Baltimore Works facility on machines designed by a Western Electric Senior development engineer.

[ 76 ] In 1970, A. Michael Noll invented a tactile, force-feedback system, coupled with interactive stereoscopic computer display.

In 1971, an improved task priority system for computerized telephone exchange switching systems for telephone traffic was invented by Erna Schneider Hoover , who received one of the first software patents for it.

In 1972, Dennis Ritchie developed the compiled programming language C as a replacement for the interpreted language B , which was then used in a worse is better rewrite of UNIX. Also, the language AWK was designed and implemented by Alfred Aho , Peter Weinberger , and Brian Kernighan of Bell Laboratories. Also in 1972, Marc Rochkind invented the Source Code Control System .

In 1976, optical fiber systems were first tested in Georgia .

Production of their first internally designed microprocessor , the BELLMAC-8 , began in 1977. In 1980 they demonstrated the first single-chip 32-bit microprocessor, the Bellmac 32 A, which went into production in 1982.

In 1978, the proprietary operating system Oryx/Pecos was developed from scratch by Bell Labs in order to run AT&T's large-scale PBX switching equipment. It was first used with AT&T's flagship System 75, and until very recently was used in all variations up through and including Definity G3 (Generic 3) switches, now manufactured by Avaya .

1980s [ edit ] Bell Laboratories logo, used from 1984 until 1996 Teletype/AT&T 5620 DMD version of the Blit. Terminal software written by Rob Pike and hardware designed by Bart Locanthi, Jr.

During the 1980s, the operating system Plan 9 from Bell Labs was developed extending the UNIX model. Also, the Radiodrum , an electronic music instrument played in three space dimensions, was invented.

In 1980, the TDMA digital cellular telephone technology was patented.

In late 1981, the Bell Labs Research organization internal use of a terminal called Jerq led to the Blit terminal being renamed by designers Rob Pike and Bart Locanthi, Jr for the UNIX operating system. It was a programmable bitmap graphics terminal using multi-layers of opened windows operated by a keyboard and a distinguished red-colored three-button digitized mouse.

[ 77 ] It was later known as the AT&T 5620 DMD terminal for commercial sales. The Blit used the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, whereas the Teletype/AT&T 5620 Dot Mapped Display terminal used the Western Electric WE32000 microprocessor.

[ 78 ] The launching of the Bell Labs Fellows Award started in 1982 to recognize and honor scientists and engineers who have made outstanding and sustained R&D contributions at AT&T with a level of distinction. As of the 2021 inductees, 336 people have received the honor.

[ 79 ] Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie were also Bell Labs Fellows for 1982. Ritchie started in 1967 at Bell Labs in the Bell Labs Computer Systems Research department.

[ 80 ] Thompson started in 1966. Both co-inventors of the UNIX operating system and C language were also awarded decades later the 2011 Japan Prize for Information and Communications.

In 1982, fractional quantum Hall effect was discovered by Horst Störmer and former Bell Laboratories researchers Robert B. Laughlin and Daniel C. Tsui ; they consequently won a Nobel Prize in 1998 for the discovery.

In 1984, the first photoconductive antennas for picosecond electromagnetic radiation were demonstrated by Auston and others. This type of antenna became an important component in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy . In 1984, Karmarkar's algorithm for linear programming was developed by mathematician Narendra Karmarkar . Also in 1984, a divestiture agreement signed in 1982 with the American Federal government forced the breakup of AT&T, and Bellcore (now iconectiv ) was split off from Bell Laboratories to provide the same R&D functions for the newly created local exchange carriers . AT&T also was limited to using the Bell trademark only in association with Bell Laboratories.

Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc.

became a wholly owned company of the new AT&T Technologies unit, the former Western Electric. The 5ESS Switch was developed during this transition.

The National Medal of Technology was awarded to Bell Labs, the first corporation to achieve this honor in February 1985.

[ 81 ] In 1985, laser cooling was used to slow and manipulate atoms by Steven Chu and team. In 1985, the modeling language A Mathematical Programming Language , AMPL , was developed by Robert Fourer , David M. Gay and Brian Kernighan at Bell Laboratories. Also in 1985, Bell Laboratories was awarded the National Medal of Technology "For contribution over decades to modern communication systems".

In 1985, [ 82 ] the programming language C++ had its first commercial release.

[ 83 ] Bjarne Stroustrup started developing C++ at Bell Laboratories in 1979 as an extension to the original C language.

[ 83 ] Arthur Ashkin invented optical tweezers that grab particles, atoms, viruses and other living cells with their laser beam fingers. A major breakthrough came in 1987, when Ashkin used the tweezers to capture living bacteria without harming them. He immediately began studying biological systems using the optical tweezers, which are now widely used to investigate the machinery of life.

[ 84 ] He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics (2018) for his work involving optical tweezers and their application to biological systems.

In the mid-1980s, the Transmission System departments of Bell Labs developed highly reliable long-haul fiber-optic communications systems based on SONET , and network operations techniques that made very high-volume, near-instantaneous communications across the North American continent possible. Fail-safe and disaster-related traffic management operations systems enhanced the usefulness of the fiber optics. There was a synergy in the land-based and sea-based fiber optic systems even though they were developed by different divisions within the company. These systems are still in use throughout the U.S. today.

Charles A. Burrus became a Bell Labs Fellow in 1988 for his work done as a Technical Staff member. Prior to this accomplishment, was awarded in 1982 the AT&T Bell Laboratories Distinguished Technical Staff Award. Charles started in 1955 at the Holmdel Bell Labs location and retired in 1996 with consultations to Lucent Technologies up to 2002.

[ 85 ] In 1988, TAT-8 became the first transatlantic fiber-optic cable . Bell Labs in Freehold, NJ developed the 1.3-micron fiber, cable, splicing, laser detector, and 280 Mbit/s repeater for 40,000 telephone-call capacity.

In the late 1980s, realizing that voiceband modems were approaching the Shannon limit on bit rate, Richard D. Gitlin , Jean-Jacques Werner and their colleagues pioneered a major breakthrough. They invented DSL ( digital subscriber line ), the technology that achieved megabit transmission on installed copper telephone lines, and this facilitated the broadband era.

[ 89 ] The scientist, W. Lincoln Hawkins in 1992 received the National Medal of Technology for work done at Bell Labs.

[ 87 ] In 1992, Jack Salz, Jack Winters and Richard D. Gitlin provided the foundational technology to demonstrate that adaptive antenna arrays at the transmitter and receiver can substantially increase both the reliability (via diversity) and capacity (via spatial multiplexing) of wireless systems without expanding the bandwidth.

[ 90 ] Subsequently, the BLAST system proposed by Gerard Foschini and colleagues dramatically expanded the capacity of wireless systems.

[ 91 ] This technology, known today as MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output), was a significant factor in the standardization, commercialization, performance improvement, and growth of cellular and wireless LAN systems.

Amos Joel in 1993 received the National Medal of Technology.

[ 87 ] Two AT&T Bell Labs scientists, Joel Engel and Richard Frenkiel, were honored with the National Medal of Technology, in 1994.

In April 2006, Bell Laboratories' parent company, Lucent Technologies, signed a merger agreement with Alcatel . On December 1, 2006, the merged company, Alcatel-Lucent , began operations. This deal raised concerns in the United States, where Bell Laboratories works on defense contracts. A separate company, LGS Innovations, with an American board was set up to manage Bell Laboratories' and Lucent's sensitive U.S. government contracts. In March 2019, LGS Innovations was purchased by CACI .

[ 96 ] In December 2007, it was announced that the former Lucent Bell Laboratories and the former Alcatel Research and Innovation would be merged into one organization under the name of Bell Laboratories.
