An animation of the [inner Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Solar_System "Inner Solar System") planets' orbit around the Sun. The duration of the year is the time taken to go around the Sun.

A **year** is a [unit of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_time "Unit of time") based on how long it takes the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") to orbit the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-1) In scientific use, the [tropical year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year "Tropical year") (approximately 365 [solar days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_day "Synodic day"), 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds) and the [sidereal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year "Sidereal year") (about 20 minutes longer) are more exact. The modern [calendar year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_year "Calendar year"), as reckoned according to the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar"), approximates the tropical year by using a system of [leap years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_years "Leap years").

The term 'year' is also used to indicate other periods of roughly similar duration, such as the lunar year (a roughly 354-day cycle of twelve of the Moon's phases‚Äì see [lunar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar "Lunar calendar")), as well as periods loosely associated with the calendar or astronomical year, such as the [seasonal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_year "Seasonal year"), the [fiscal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year "Fiscal year"), the [academic year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_year "Academic year"), etc.

Due to the Earth's [axial tilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt "Axial tilt"), the course of a year sees the passing of the [seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season"), marked by changes in [weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather "Weather"), the hours of [daylight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight "Daylight"), and, consequently, [vegetation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation "Vegetation") and [soil fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_fertility "Soil fertility"). In [temperate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate "Temperate") and [subpolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpolar_climate "Subpolar climate") regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(season) "Spring (season)"), [summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer "Summer"), [autumn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn "Autumn"), and [winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter "Winter"). In [tropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics "Tropics") and [subtropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics "Subtropics") regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [seasonal tropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics#Seasons_and_climate "Tropics"), the annual [wet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season "Wet season") and [dry seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season "Dry season") are recognized and tracked.

By extension, the term 'year' can also be applied to the time taken for the [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") of any [astronomical object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") around its [primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_body "Primary body")‚Äì for example the [Martian year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Year "Timekeeping on Mars") of roughly 1.88 Earth years.

The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [Great Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Year "Great Year").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-2)

Calendar year
-------------

A [calendar year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_year "Calendar year") is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given [calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar "Calendar"). The [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar"), or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [common year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_year "Common year") of 365 days or a [leap year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year "Leap year") of 366 days, as do the [Julian calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar "Julian calendar"). For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days (97 out of 400 years are leap years).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-3)

Abbreviation
------------

In English, the [unit of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_time "Unit of time") for year is commonly abbreviated as "y" or "yr". The symbol "a" (for [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _annus_, year) is sometimes used in scientific literature, though its exact duration may be inconsistent.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Etymology
---------

English _year_ (via [West Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Saxon_dialect_(Old_English) "West Saxon dialect (Old English)")_ƒ°ƒìar_ (/j…õar/), [Anglian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglian_dialects "Anglian dialects")_ƒ°ƒìr_) continues [Proto-Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic "Proto-Germanic")_*j«£ran_ (_*j[ƒì‚ÇÅ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic\_language#%C4%93%E2%82%81\_and\_%C4%93%E2%82%82 "Proto-Germanic language")ran_). Cognates are [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language")_Jahr_, [Old High German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_High_German "Old High German")_jƒÅr_, [Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse "Old Norse")_√°r_ and [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_language "Gothic language")_[jer](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%90%8C%BE%F0%90%8C%B4%F0%90%8D%82 "wikt:êåæêå¥êçÇ")_, from the [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European "Proto-Indo-European") noun _[*yeh‚ÇÅr-om](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh%E2%82%81- "wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh‚ÇÅ-")_ "year, season". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [ablaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablaut "Ablaut")) are [Avestan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avestan "Avestan")_yƒÅr«ù_ "year", [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek")·Ω•œÅŒ± (_h·πìra_) "year, season, period of time" (whence "[hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour "Hour")"), [Old Church Slavonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Church_Slavonic "Old Church Slavonic")_jar≈≠_, and [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin")_hornus_ "of this year".[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Latin _[annus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus "Annus")_ (a [2nd declension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_declension "2nd declension") masculine noun; _annum_ is the [accusative singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accusative_case "Accusative case"); _annƒ´_ is [genitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive "Genitive") singular and [nominative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative "Nominative") plural; _ann≈ç_ the [dative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dative "Dative") and [ablative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablative "Ablative") singular) is from a [PIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language "Proto-Indo-European language") noun _*h‚ÇÇet-no-_, which also yielded Gothic _a√æn_ "year" (only the dative plural _a√ænam_ is attested).

Although most languages treat the word as thematic _*yeh‚ÇÅr-o-_, there is evidence for an original derivation with an _*-r/n_ suffix, _*yeh‚ÇÅ-ro-_. Both Indo-European words for year, _*yeh‚ÇÅ-ro-_ and _*h‚ÇÇet-no-_, would then be derived from verbal roots meaning "to go, move", _*h‚ÇÅey-_ and _*h‚ÇÇet-_, respectively (compare [Vedic Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_Sanskrit "Vedic Sanskrit")_√©ti_ "goes", _atasi_ "thou goest, wanderest"). A number of English words are derived from Latin _annus_, such as [annual](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/annual "wikt:annual"), [annuity](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/annuity "wikt:annuity"), [anniversary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anniversary "wikt:anniversary"), etc.; _[per annum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/per\_annum "wikt:per annum")_ means "each year", _[ann≈ç Dominƒ´](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno\_Domini "Anno Domini")_ means "in the year of the Lord".

The Greek word for "year", ·ºîœÑŒøœÇ, is cognate with Latin _vetus_ "old", from the PIE word _*wetos-_ "year", also preserved in this meaning in [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit")_\_vat-sa-ras\__ "year" and _\_vat-sa-\__ "yearling (calf)", the latter also reflected in Latin _[vitulus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vitulus "wikt:vitulus")_ "bull calf", English _wether_ "ram" (Old English _we√∞er_, Gothic _wi√ærus_ "lamb").

In some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in "summers", or "winters", or "harvests". Examples include Chinese [Âπ¥](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%B9%B4 "wikt:Âπ¥") "year", originally [ÁßÇ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A7%82 "wikt:ÁßÇ"), an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting "harvest". Slavic besides _[god≈≠](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/god%D1%8A "wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/god—ä")_ "time period; year" uses _[lƒõto](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/l%C4%9Bto "wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/lƒõto")_ "summer; year".

Intercalation
-------------

Astronomical years do not have an [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") number of days or lunar months. Any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [intercalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping) "Intercalation (timekeeping)") such as leap years.

### Julian calendar

In the [Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar "Julian calendar"), the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year during which a leap day is [intercalated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping)#Solar_calendars "Intercalation (timekeeping)") into the month of February. The name "Leap Day" is applied to the added day.

In astronomy, the [Julian year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_year_(astronomy) "Julian year (astronomy)") is a unit of time defined as 365.25 days, each of exactly 86 400[seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second") ([SI base unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit "SI base unit")), totaling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-5)

#### Revised Julian calendar

The [Revised Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Julian_calendar "Revised Julian calendar"), proposed in 1923 and used in some [Eastern Orthodox Churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church"), has 218 leap years every 900 years, for the average (mean) year length of 365.242 2222 days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, 365.242 19 days (relative error of 9¬∑10). In the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-6)

### Gregorian calendar

The [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar") aims to ensure that the [northward equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northward_equinox "Northward equinox") falls on or shortly before March 21 and hence it follows the [northward equinox year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year "Tropical year"), or [tropical year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year "Tropical year").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-7) Because 97 out of 400 years are leap years, the mean length of the Gregorian calendar year is 365.2425 days; with a relative error below one [ppm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_million "Parts per million") (8¬∑10) relative to the current length of the mean [tropical year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year "Tropical year") (365.242 189 days) and even closer to the current _March equinox year_ of 365.242 374 days that it aims to match.

### Other calendars

Historically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [leap months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_month "Leap month") on an observational basis. Lunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([Hebrew calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar "Hebrew calendar"), various [Hindu calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_calendar "Hindu calendar")).

A modern adaptation of the historical [Jalali calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalali_calendar "Jalali calendar"), known as the [Solar Hijri calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Hijri_calendar "Solar Hijri calendar") (1925), is a purely [solar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar "Solar calendar") with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([Nowruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz "Nowruz")) on the day of [vernal equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox "March equinox") (for the time zone of [Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran "Tehran")), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.

Year numbering
--------------

A [calendar era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_era "Calendar era") assigns a [cardinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number_(linguistics) "Cardinal number (linguistics)") to each sequential year, using a reference event in the past (called the [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch "Epoch")) as the beginning of the era.

The Gregorian calendar era is the world's most widely used [civil calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_calendar "Civil calendar").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-8) Its epoch is a [6th century estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_Exiguus#Anno_Domini "Dionysius Exiguus") of the date of birth of [Jesus of Nazareth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_of_Nazareth "Jesus of Nazareth"). Two notations are used to indicate year numbering in the Gregorian calendar: the Christian "[Anno Domini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini "Anno Domini")" (meaning "in the year of the Lord"), abbreviated AD; and "[Common Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era "Common Era")", abbreviated CE, preferred by many of other faiths and none. Year numbers are based on [inclusive counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_counting "Inclusive counting"), so that there is no "year zero". Years before the epoch are abbreviated BC for [Before Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Christ "Before Christ") or BCE for [Before the Common Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_the_Common_Era "Before the Common Era"). In [Astronomical year numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering "Astronomical year numbering"), positive numbers indicate years AD/CE, the number [0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(year) "0 (year)") designates 1 BC/BCE, ‚àí1 designates 2 BC/BCE, and so on.

Other eras include that of [Ancient Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome"), _[Ab Urbe Condita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab\_Urbe\_Condita "Ab Urbe Condita")_ ("from the foundation of [the city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome")), abbreviated AUC; _[Anno Mundi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno\_Mundi "Anno Mundi")_ ("year of the world"), used for the [Hebrew calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar "Hebrew calendar") and abbreviated AM; and the [Japanese imperial eras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_calendar "Japanese calendar"). The Islamic [Hijri year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijri_year "Hijri year"), (year of the [Hijrah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijrah "Hijrah"), _[Anno Hegirae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno\_Hegirae "Anno Hegirae")_ abbreviated AH), is a [lunar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar "Lunar calendar") of twelve [lunar months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month "Lunar month") and thus is shorter than a solar year.

Pragmatic divisions
-------------------

Financial and scientific calculations often use a [365-day calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/365-day_calendar "365-day calendar") to simplify daily rates.

### Fiscal year

A [fiscal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year "Fiscal year") or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.

For example, in [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada") and [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits; in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia") it runs from July 1; while in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") the fiscal year of the [federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States") runs from October 1.

### Academic year

An academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [educational institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_institution "Educational institution"). The academic year may be divided into [academic terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_term "Academic term"), such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries in the [Northern Hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere "Northern Hemisphere") starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July, providing a summer break from study between academic years. In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the Hebrew calendar.

Some schools in the UK, Canada and the United States divide the academic year into _three_ roughly equal-length terms (called _trimesters_ or _quarters_ in the United States), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis. Other schools break the year into _two_ main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a _quarter_ (or _term_ in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session or a short January session.

Some other schools, including some in the United States, have _four_ marking periods. Some schools in the United States, notably [Boston Latin School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Latin_School "Boston Latin School"), may divide the year into _five or more_ marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [positive correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_correlation "Positive correlation") between report frequency and academic achievement.

There are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Schools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.

Astronomical years
------------------

### Julian year

The Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit now defined as exactly 365.25 days of 86 400[SI seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second") each[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-ESttAA-9) ("[ephemeris days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris_day "Ephemeris day")"). This is one meaning of the unit "year" used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of 36 525 ephemeris days and the Julian millennium of 365 250 ephemeris days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify an amount of time (not how many "real" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of ephemeris days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [light-year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year").

In the [Unified Code for Units of Measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Code_for_Units_of_Measure "Unified Code for Units of Measure") (but not according to the [International Union of Pure and Applied Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Physics "International Union of Pure and Applied Physics") or the [International Union of Geological Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Geological_Sciences "International Union of Geological Sciences"), see below), the symbol 'a' (without subscript) always refers to the Julian year, 'a j', of exactly 31 557 600[seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second").

365.25 d √ó 86 400 s = 1 a = 1 a j = 31.5576[Ms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second#SI_multiples "Second")
The [SI multiplier prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#SI_prefix_multipliers) may be applied to it to form "ka", "Ma", etc.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-UCUM-10)

The scientific Julian year is not to be confused with a year in the Jullian calendar. The scientific Julian year is a multiple of the SI second; it is today "astronomical" only in the sense "used in astronomy", whilst true astronomical years are based on the movements of celestial bodies.

### Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years

Each of these three years can be loosely called an _astronomical year_.

The sidereal year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit"), as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin _sidera_, singular _sidus_). Its average duration is 365.256 363 004 days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [J2000.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J2000.0 "J2000.0") = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [TT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time "Terrestrial Time")).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-11)

Today the mean tropical year is defined as the period of time for the mean [ecliptic longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic_longitude "Ecliptic longitude") of the Sun to increase by 360 degrees.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-12) Since the Sun's ecliptic longitude is measured with respect to the equinox,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-13) the tropical year comprises a complete cycle of the seasons and is the basis of [solar calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar "Solar calendar") such as the internationally used [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar"). The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox, by a minute or two, for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's [axial precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession_(astronomy) "Axial precession (astronomy)"), this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year. The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-14) (= 365.242 19 d √ó 86 400 s). The length of the tropical year varies a bit over thousands of years because the rate of axial precession is not constant.

The anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [apsides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis "Apsis"). The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [perihelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion "Perihelion"), where the Earth is closest to the Sun, and the [aphelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphelion "Aphelion"), where the Earth is farthest from the Sun. The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages. Its average duration is 365.259636 days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-15)

### Draconic year

The draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taken for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the same [lunar node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_node "Lunar node") (a point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic). The year is associated with [eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse "Eclipse"): these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [eclipse seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_season "Eclipse season") every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is

346.620 075 883 days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).
This term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [lunar precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_precession "Lunar precession"), that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: 18.612 815 932 Julian years (6 798.331 019 days; at the epoch J2000.0).

### Full moon cycle

The [full moon cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon_cycle "Full moon cycle") is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [perigee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perigee "Perigee") of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [full moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon "Full moon"), and also with the varying duration of the [synodic month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month "Month"). The duration of one full moon cycle is:

411.784 430 29 days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 35 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).
### Lunar year

The [lunar year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_year "Lunar year") comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims") use this for religious purposes, including calculating the date of the [Hajj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj "Hajj") and the fasting month of [Ramadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan "Ramadan"), and thus also the [Eids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_holidays "Muslim holidays"). The [Jewish calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar "Hebrew calendar") is also mainly lunar, but with the addition of an intercalary lunar month once every two or three years, designed to keep the calendar broadly synchronous with the solar cycle. Thus, a lunar year on the Jewish (Hebrew) calendar consists of either twelve or thirteen lunar months.

### Vague year

The vague year, from _annus vagus_ or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years. Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [schematic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/schematic "wikt:schematic") months of 30 days each plus 5 [epagomenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping) "Intercalation (timekeeping)") days. The vague year was used in the calendars of [Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_calendar "Ethiopian calendar"), [Ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_calendar "Egyptian calendar"), [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendar "Iranian calendar"), [Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_calendar "Armenian calendar") and in [Mesoamerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_calendars "Mesoamerican calendars") among the [Aztecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_calendar "Aztec calendar") and [Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haab%27 "Haab'").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-16) It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.

### Heliacal year

A heliacal year is the interval between the [heliacal risings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliacal_rising "Heliacal rising") of a star. It differs from the [sidereal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year "Sidereal year") for stars away from the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic") due mainly to the [precession of the equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession_of_the_equinoxes "Precession of the equinoxes").

#### Sothic year

The [Sothic year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sothic_cycle "Sothic cycle") is the heliacal year, the interval between heliacal risings, of the star [Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius "Sirius"). It is currently less than the [sidereal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#Sidereal,_tropical,_and_anomalistic_years) and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.

### Gaussian year

The [Gaussian year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_year "Gaussian year") is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [Gaussian gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_gravitational_constant "Gaussian gravitational constant"). Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:

365.256 8983 days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).
### Besselian year

The [Besselian year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besselian_epoch#Besselian_years "Besselian epoch") is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280¬∞. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician [Friedrich Bessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Bessel "Friedrich Bessel"). The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-17)

B = 1900.0 + (Julian date TT ‚àí 2 415 020.313 52) / 365.242 198 781
The TT subscript indicates that for this formula, the Julian date should use the [Terrestrial Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time "Terrestrial Time") scale, or its predecessor, [ephemeris time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris_time "Ephemeris time").

### Variation in the length of the year and the day

The exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.

*   The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession "Precession"), and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets. Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year. So a "tropical year" measured from one passage of the northward ("vernal") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward ("autumnal") equinox. The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.
*   Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet. This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year. Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.
*   [Tidal drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_drag "Tidal drag") between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease. The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [post-glacial rebound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound "Post-glacial rebound") and [sea level rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise "Sea level rise").

Numerical value of year variation

 Mean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years. In the tables a day is 86 400 SI seconds long.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-21)

Mean year lengths for 2000 | Type of year | Days | Hours | Minutes | Seconds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Tropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year "Tropical year") | 365 | 5 | 48 | 45 |
| [Sidereal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year "Sidereal year") | 365 | 6 | 9 | 10 |
| Anomalistic | 365 | 6 | 13 | 53 |
| Eclipse | 346 | 14 | 52 | 55 |

Year length difference from 2000

### Summary

Some of the year lengths in this table are in average [solar days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_day "Solar day"), which are slowly getting longer (at a rate that cannot be exactly predicted in advance) and are now around 86 400.002[SI seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second").

| Days | Year type |
| --- | --- |
| 346.62 | Draconic, also called eclipse |
| 354.37 | Lunar |
| 365 | Solar days: vague, and a [common year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_year "Common year") in many [solar calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar "Solar calendar") |
| 365.242 19 | Tropical, also called solar, averaged and then rounded for epoch [J2000.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J2000.0 "J2000.0") |
| 365.2425 | Gregorian, solar days averaged over the 400-year cycle |
| 365.25 | Julian, solar days averaged over the four-year cycle |
| 365.256 36 | Sidereal, for epoch [J2000.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J2000.0 "J2000.0") |
| 365.259 636 | Anomalistic, averaged and then rounded for epoch J2011.0 |
| 366 | [Leap year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year "Leap year") in many [solar calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar "Solar calendar") |

An average Gregorian year may be said to be 365.2425 [days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day "Day") (52.1775 [weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week "Week"), and if an hour is defined as one twenty-fourth of a day, 8 765.82[hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour "Hour"), 525 949.2[minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute "Minute") or 31 556 952[seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second")). Note however that in absolute time the average Gregorian year is not adequately defined unless the period of the averaging (start and end dates) is stated, because each period of 400 years is longer (by more than 1000 seconds) than the preceding one as the rotation of the Earth slows. In this calendar, a common year is 365 days (8760 hours, 525 600 minutes or 31 536 000 seconds), and a leap year is 366 days (8784 hours, 527 040 minutes or 31 622 400 seconds). The 400-year civil cycle of the Gregorian calendar has 146 097 days and hence exactly 20 871 weeks.

Greater astronomical years
--------------------------

### Equinoctial cycle

The [Great Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Year "Great Year"), or equinoctial cycle, corresponds to a complete revolution of the equinoxes around the ecliptic. Its length is about 25,700 years.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-23)

### Galactic year

The [Galactic year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_year "Galactic year") is the time it takes Earth's [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") to revolve once around the [Galactic Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center "Galactic Center"). It comprises roughly 230 million Earth years.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-24)

IUPAC‚ÄìIUGS proposal
-------------------

In 2011, a task group of the IUPAC and the [International Union of Geological Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Geological_Sciences "International Union of Geological Sciences") (IUGS) jointly recommended defining the annus for geological purposes as

> 1 a=31 556 925.445 seconds[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-IUPAC%E2%80%93IUGS-25) (approximately 365.242 192 65[ephemeris days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris_day "Ephemeris day"))

They chose a value close to the length of tropical year for the [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy) "Epoch (astronomy)") 2000.0 (which is roughly the length of the tropical year 2000; the length of the tropical year is slowly decreasing).[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-IUPAC%E2%80%93IUGS-25) However, the definition is as a multiple of the second, the SI base unit of time, and independent of astronomical definitions, since "[d]efinitions of the annus that are based on an intermediate relationship via the day, such as the Julian and Gregorian year, bear an inherent, pre-programmed obsolescence because of the variability of Earth's orbital movement".[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-IUPAC%E2%80%93IUGS-25) It differs from the Julian year of 365.25 days (3.1557600 √ó 10 7 s) by about 21 [parts per million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_million "Parts per million").

As of April 2025, the IUPAC Green Book (4th edition) provides a definition of the year as a = 31 556 925.9747 seconds.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-26)

Seasonal year
-------------

A seasonal year is the time between successive recurrences of a seasonal event such as the flooding of a river, the migration of a species of bird, the flowering of a species of plant, the first frost, or the first scheduled game of a certain sport. All of these events can have wide variations of more than a [month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month "Month") from year to year.

Symbols and abbreviations
-------------------------

A common symbol for the year as a [unit of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_time "Unit of time") is "a", taken from the Latin word _annus_. For example, the U.S. [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology") (NIST) _Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)_ supports the symbol "a" as the unit of time for a year.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-NIST-27)

In English, the abbreviations "y" or "yr" are more commonly used in non-scientific literature.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-How-28) In some [Earth sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_sciences "Earth sciences") branches ([geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology") and [paleontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology "Paleontology")), "[kyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyr "Kyr"), [myr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myr "Myr"), [byr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byr "Byr")" (thousands, millions, and billions of years, respectively) and similar abbreviations are used to denote intervals of time remote from the present.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-AGUStyle-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-Strat-30) In [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") the abbreviations kyr, Myr and Gyr are in common use for kiloyears, megayears and gigayears.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-MNRAS_Style-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-AAS_Style-32)

The [Unified Code for Units of Measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Code_for_Units_of_Measure "Unified Code for Units of Measure") (UCUM) disambiguates the varying symbologies of ISO 1000, ISO 2955 and ANSI X3.50 by using:[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-UCUM-10)

a t = 365.242 19 days for the mean tropical year;a j = 365.25 days for the mean Julian year;a g = 365.2425 days for the mean [Gregorian year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_year "Gregorian year");
In the UCUM, the symbol "a", without any qualifier, equals 1 a j. The UCUM also minimizes confusion with _[are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare#Are "Hectare")_, a unit of area, by using the abbreviation "ar".

Since 1989, the [International Astronomical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union "International Astronomical Union") (IAU) recognizes the symbol "a" rather than "yr" for a year, notes the different kinds of year, and recommends adopting the Julian year of 365.25 days, unless otherwise specified (IAU _Style Manual_).[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-IAU-34)

Since 1987, the [International Union of Pure and Applied Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Physics "International Union of Pure and Applied Physics") (IUPAP) notes "a" as the general symbol for the time unit year ([IUPAP _Red Book_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAP_Red_Book "IUPAP Red Book")).[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-35) Since 1993, the [International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry "International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry") (IUPAC) [_Green Book_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC_Green_Book "IUPAC Green Book") also uses the same symbol "a", notes the difference between Gregorian year and Julian year, and adopts the former (a = 365.2425 days),[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-36) also noted in the [IUPAC _Gold Book_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC_Gold_Book "IUPAC Gold Book").[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-Gold-37)

In 2011, a task group of IUPAC and IUGS recommended the use of a as the symbol for the annus (along with multiples such as Ma) for both time intervals and absolute ages.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-IUPAC%E2%80%93IUGS-25) This proved controversial as it conflicts with an earlier convention among geoscientists to use "a" specifically for absolute age before the present (e.g. 1 Ma for 1 million years ago), and "y" or "yr" (and My, Myr etc) for a time interval or period of time.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-Biever-war-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-iupac2011-39)

### SI prefix multipliers

For the following, there are alternative forms that elide the consecutive vowels, such as _kilannus_, _megannus_, etc. The exponents and exponential notations are typically used for calculating and in displaying calculations, and for conserving space, as in tables of data.

Units of time with SI prefixes | Symbol | Definition | Common scientific uses and notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ka (for _kiloannus_) | One [thousand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand "Thousand") or 10 3 years, also known as a [millennium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium "Millennium") in [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology") and calendar uses. | Geology, paleontology, and [archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology "Archaeology") for the [Holocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene "Holocene") and [Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene "Pleistocene")[periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(geology) "Period (geology)"), where a non‚àí[radiocarbon dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating "Radiocarbon dating") technique such as [ice core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core "Ice core") dating, [dendrochronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology "Dendrochronology"), [uranium-thorium dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-thorium_dating "Uranium-thorium dating") or [varve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varve "Varve") analysis is used as the primary method for age determination. If age is determined primarily by radiocarbon dating, then the age should be expressed in either radiocarbon or calendar (calibrated) years [Before Present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present "Before Present"). |
| Ma (for _megaannus_) | One [million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million "Million") or 10 6 years. | Geology, paleontology, and [celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics"). In astronomical applications, the year used is the Julian year of precisely 365.25 days. In geology and paleontology, the year is not so precise and varies depending on the author. |
| Ga (for _gigaannus_) | One [billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000_(number) "1000000000 (number)") or 10 9 years. | [Cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology") and geology.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-40) For example, [the formation of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth "History of Earth") occurred approximately 4.54 Ga (4.54 billion years) ago and the [age of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe "Age of the universe") is approximately 13.8 Ga. |
| Ta (for _teraannus_) | One [trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000000_(number) "1000000000000 (number)") or 10 12 years | An extremely long unit of time, about 70 times as long as the age of the universe. It is the same order of magnitude as the expected life span of a small [red dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf "Red dwarf"). |
| Pa (for _petaannus_) | One [quadrillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%5E15 "10^15") or 10 15 years. | The [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life "Half-life") of the [nuclide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclide "Nuclide")[cadmium-113](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium-113 "Cadmium-113") is about 8 Pa.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-41) This symbol coincides with that for the [pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit) "Pascal (unit)") without a multiplier prefix, but context will normally be sufficient to distinguish long time periods from pressure values. |
| Ea (for _exaannus_) | One [quintillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintillion "Quintillion") or 10 18 years. | The half-life of [tungsten-180](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten-180 "Tungsten-180") is 1.8 Ea.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-42) |

### Abbreviations for "years ago"

In geology and paleontology, a distinction sometimes is made between abbreviation "yr" for _years_ and "ya" for _years ago_, combined with prefixes for thousand, million, or billion.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-AGUStyle-29)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-NASC-43) In archaeology, dealing with more recent periods, normally expressed dates, e.g. "10,000 BC", may be used as a more traditional form than [Before Present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present "Before Present") ("BP").

These abbreviations include:

| Non-SI abbreviations | Short for | SI-prefixed equivalent | Definition | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event | Time |
| [kyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyr "Kyr") | kilo years | ka | Thousand years |  |

Use of "mya" and "bya" is deprecated in modern geophysics, the recommended usage being "Ma" and "Ga" for dates [Before Present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present "Before Present"), but "m.y." for the durations of epochs.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-AGUStyle-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-Strat-30) This _ad hoc_ distinction between "absolute" time and time intervals is somewhat controversial amongst members of the Geological Society of America.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#cite_note-45)

Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The "present" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as "ago" or "before the present" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.
