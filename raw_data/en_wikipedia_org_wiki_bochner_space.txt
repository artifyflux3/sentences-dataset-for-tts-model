The space L p ( X ) {\displaystyle L^{p}(X)} consists of (equivalence classes of) all Bochner measurable functions f {\displaystyle f} with values in the Banach space X {\displaystyle X} whose norm ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ X {\displaystyle \|f\|_{X}} lies in the standard L p {\displaystyle L^{p}} space. Thus, if X {\displaystyle X} is the set of complex numbers, it is the standard Lebesgue L p {\displaystyle L^{p}} space.

Almost all standard results on L p {\displaystyle L^{p}} spaces do hold on Bochner spaces too; in particular, the Bochner spaces L p ( X ) {\displaystyle L^{p}(X)} are Banach spaces for 1 ≤ ≤ p ≤ ≤ ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle 1\leq p\leq \infty .} Bochner spaces are named for the mathematician Salomon Bochner .

Definition [ edit ] Given a measure space ( T , Σ Σ ; μ μ ) , {\displaystyle (T,\Sigma ;\mu ),} a Banach space ( X , ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ X ) {\displaystyle \left(X,\|\,\cdot \,\|_{X}\right)} and 1 ≤ ≤ p ≤ ≤ ∞ ∞ , {\displaystyle 1\leq p\leq \infty ,} the Bochner space L p ( T ; X ) {\displaystyle L^{p}(T;X)} is defined to be the Kolmogorov quotient (by equality almost everywhere ) of the space of all Bochner measurable functions u : T → → X {\displaystyle u:T\to X} such that the corresponding norm is finite: ‖ ‖ u ‖ ‖ L p ( T ; X ) := ( ∫ ∫ T ‖ ‖ u ( t ) ‖ ‖ X p d μ μ ( t ) ) 1 / p < + ∞ ∞ for 1 ≤ ≤ p < ∞ ∞ , {\displaystyle \|u\|_{L^{p}(T;X)}:=\left(\int _{T}\|u(t)\|_{X}^{p}\,\mathrm {d} \mu (t)\right)^{1/p}<+\infty {\mbox{ for }}1\leq p<\infty ,} ‖ ‖ u ‖ ‖ L ∞ ∞ ( T ; X ) := e s s s u p t ∈ ∈ T ‖ ‖ u ( t ) ‖ ‖ X < + ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle \|u\|_{L^{\infty }(T;X)}:=\mathrm {ess\,sup} _{t\in T}\|u(t)\|_{X}<+\infty .} In other words, as is usual in the study of L p {\displaystyle L^{p}} spaces, L p ( T ; X ) {\displaystyle L^{p}(T;X)} is a space of equivalence classes of functions, where two functions are defined to be equivalent if they are equal everywhere except upon a μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } - measure zero subset of T .

{\displaystyle T.} As is also usual in the study of such spaces, it is usual to abuse notation and speak of a "function" in L p ( T ; X ) {\displaystyle L^{p}(T;X)} rather than an equivalence class (which would be more technically correct).

Applications [ edit ] Bochner spaces are often used in the functional analysis approach to the study of partial differential equations that depend on time, e.g. the heat equation : if the temperature g ( t , x ) {\displaystyle g(t,x)} is a scalar function of time and space, one can write ( f ( t ) ) ( x ) := g ( t , x ) {\displaystyle (f(t))(x):=g(t,x)} to make f {\displaystyle f} a family f ( t ) {\displaystyle f(t)} (parametrized by time) of functions of space, possibly in some Bochner space.

Application to PDE theory [ edit ] Very often, the space T {\displaystyle T} is an interval of time over which we wish to solve some partial differential equation, and μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } will be one-dimensional Lebesgue measure . The idea is to regard a function of time and space as a collection of functions of space, this collection being parametrized by time. For example, in the solution of the heat equation on a region Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and an interval of time [ 0 , T ] , {\displaystyle [0,T],} one seeks solutions u ∈ ∈ L 2 ( [ 0 , T ] ; H 0 1 ( Ω Ω ) ) {\displaystyle u\in L^{2}\left([0,T];H_{0}^{1}(\Omega )\right)} with time derivative ∂ ∂ u ∂ ∂ t ∈ ∈ L 2 ( [ 0 , T ] ; H − − 1 ( Ω Ω ) ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}{\partial t}}\in L^{2}\left([0,T];H^{-1}(\Omega )\right).} Here H 0 1 ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle H_{0}^{1}(\Omega )} denotes the Sobolev Hilbert space of once- weakly differentiable functions with first weak derivative in L 2 ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle L^{2}(\Omega )} that vanish at the boundary of Ω (in the sense of trace, or, equivalently, are limits of smooth functions with compact support in Ω); H − − 1 ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle H^{-1}(\Omega )} denotes the dual space of H 0 1 ( Ω Ω ) .

{\displaystyle H_{0}^{1}(\Omega ).} (The " partial derivative " with respect to time t {\displaystyle t} above is actually a total derivative , since the use of Bochner spaces removes the space-dependence.)
