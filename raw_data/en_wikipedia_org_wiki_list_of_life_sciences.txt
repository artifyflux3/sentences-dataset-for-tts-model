Different kinds of living creatures studied in life sciences top: an animal ( Goliath beetle ) and microorganisms ( E. coli bacteria ) bottom: a plant ( tree fern ) and humans Part of a series on Science General History Literature Method Philosophy Branches Formal Natural Physical Life Social Behavioural Cognitive Applied In society Communication Community Education Funding Policy Pseudoscience Scientist Science fiction Science portal Outline Category Article indexes Glossaries v t e This list of life sciences comprises the branches of science that involve the scientific study of life—such as microorganisms , plants , and animals , including human beings . This is one of the two major branches of natural science , the other being physical science , which is concerned with non-living matter.

Biology is the overall natural science that studies life, with the other life sciences as its sub-disciplines.

Some life sciences focus on a specific type of organism. For example, zoology is the study of animals, while botany is the study of plants. Other life sciences focus on aspects common to all or many life forms, such as anatomy and genetics . Some focus on the micro scale (e.g., molecular biology , biochemistry ), while others focus on larger scales (e.g., cytology , immunology , ethology , pharmacy, ecology). Another major branch of life sciences involves understanding the mind — neuroscience . Life-science discoveries are helpful in improving the quality and standard of life and have applications in health, agriculture, medicine, and the pharmaceutical and food science industries. For example, they have provided information on certain diseases, which has helped in the understanding of human health.

( May 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Agriculture – science and practice of cultivating plants and livestock Agronomy – science of cultivating plants for resources Biocomputers – systems of biologically derived molecules, such as DNA and proteins , are used to perform computational calculations involving storing, retrieving, and processing data. The development of biological computing has been made possible by the expanding new science of nanobiotechnology .

[ 20 ] Biocontrol – bioeffector -method of controlling pests (including insects, mites , weeds and plant diseases ) using other living organisms.

[ 21 ] Bioengineering – study of biology through the means of engineering with an emphasis on applied knowledge and especially related to biotechnology Bioelectronics – field at the convergence of electronics and biological sciences. The electrical state of biological matter significantly affects its structure and function, compare for instance the membrane potential , the signal transduction by neurons , the isoelectric point (IEP) and so on. Micro- and nano-electronic components and devices have increasingly been combined with biological systems like medical implants , biosensors , lab-on-a-chip devices etc. causing the emergence of this new scientific field.

[ 22 ] Biomaterials – any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with biological systems. As a science, biomaterials is about fifty years old. The study of biomaterials is called biomaterials science. It has experienced steady and strong growth over its history, with many companies investing large amounts of money into the development of new products. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology , chemistry , tissue engineering and materials science .

Biomedical science – healthcare science, also known as biomedical science, is a set of applied sciences applying portions of natural science or formal science , or both, to develop knowledge, interventions, or technology of use in healthcare or public health . Such disciplines as medical microbiology , clinical virology , clinical epidemiology , genetic epidemiology and pathophysiology are medical sciences.

Biomonitoring – measurement of the body burden of toxic chemical compounds , elements , or their metabolites , in biological substances.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] Often, these measurements are done in blood and urine.

[ 25 ] Biopolymer – polymers produced by living organisms; in other words, they are polymeric biomolecules . Since they are polymers , biopolymers contain monomeric units that are covalently bonded to form larger structures. There are three main classes of biopolymers, classified according to the monomeric units used and the structure of the biopolymer formed: polynucleotides ( RNA and DNA ), which are long polymers composed of 13 or more nucleotide monomers ; polypeptides , which are short polymers of amino acids; and polysaccharides , which are often linear bonded polymeric carbohydrate structures.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Biotechnology – manipulation of living matter, including genetic modification and synthetic biology [ 29 ] Conservation biology – the management of nature and of Earth's biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions. It is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on natural and social sciences, and the practice of natural resource management.

[ 30 ] Environmental health – multidisciplinary field concerned with environmental epidemiology , toxicology , and exposure science .

Fermentation technology – study of use of microorganisms for industrial manufacturing of various products like vitamins , amino acids , antibiotics , beer, wine, etc.

[ 31 ] Food science – applied science devoted to the study of food. Activities of food scientists include the development of new food products, design of processes to produce and conserve these foods, choice of packaging materials, shelf-life studies, study of the effects of food on the human body, sensory evaluation of products using panels or potential consumers, as well as microbiological, physical (texture and rheology ) and chemical testing.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Genomics – application of recombinant DNA , DNA sequencing methods, and bioinformatics to sequence, assemble, and analyze the function and structure of genomes (the complete set of DNA within a single cell of an organism).

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] The field includes efforts to determine the entire DNA sequence of organisms and fine-scale genetic mapping . The field also includes studies of intragenomic phenomena such as heterosis , epistasis , pleiotropy and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome.

[ 37 ] In contrast, the investigation of the roles and functions of single genes is a primary focus of molecular biology or genetics and is a common topic of modern medical and biological research. Research of single genes does not fall into the definition of genomics unless the aim of this genetic, pathway, and functional information analysis is to elucidate its effect on, place in, and response to the entire genome's networks.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] Health sciences – sciences which focus on health, or health care, as core parts of their subject matter. These two subject matters relate to multiple academic disciplines, both STEM disciplines, as well as emerging patient safety disciplines (such as social care research ), and are both relevant to current health science knowledge.

Medical devices – A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implant, in vitro reagent, or similar or related article that is used to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease or other conditions, and does not achieve its purposes through chemical action within or on the body (which would make it a drug).

[ 40 ] Whereas medicinal products (also called pharmaceuticals ) achieve their principal action by pharmacological, metabolic or immunological means, medical devices act by other means like physical, mechanical, or thermal means.

Medical imaging – the technique and process used to create images of the human body (or parts and function thereof) for clinical or physiological research purposes [ 41 ] Immunotherapy – the " treatment of disease by inducing, enhancing, or suppressing an immune response".

[ 42 ] Immunotherapies designed to elicit or amplify an immune response are classified as activation immunotherapies, while immunotherapies that reduce or suppress are classified as suppression immunotherapies .

[ 43 ] Kinesiology – scientific study of human movement. Kinesiology, also known as human kinetics, addresses physiological, mechanical, and psychological mechanisms. Applications of kinesiology to human health include: biomechanics and orthopedics ; strength and conditioning; sport psychology ; methods of rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy; and sport and exercise. Individuals who have earned degrees in kinesiology can work in research, the fitness industry, clinical settings, and in industrial environments.

[ 44 ] Studies of human and animal motion include measures from motion tracking systems, electrophysiology of muscle and brain activity, various methods for monitoring physiological function, and other behavioral and cognitive research techniques.

[ 45 ] Parasagittal MRI of the head, with aliasing artifacts Optogenetics – a neuromodulation technique employed in neuroscience that uses a combination of techniques from optics and genetics to control and monitor the activities of individual neurons in living tissue —even within freely-moving animals—and to precisely measure the effects of those manipulations in real-time.

[ 46 ] The key reagents used in optogenetics are light-sensitive proteins. Spatially-precise neuronal control is achieved using optogenetic actuators like channelrhodopsin , halorhodopsin , and archaerhodopsin , while temporally-precise recordings can be made with the help of optogenetic sensors like Clomeleon, Mermaid, and SuperClomeleon.

[ 47 ] Pharmacogenomics – field of science and technology that analyses how genetic makeup affects an individual's response to drugs.

[ 48 ] Pharmacogenomics (a portmanteau of pharmacology and genomics ) deals with the influence of genetic variation on drug response in patients by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with a drug's efficacy or toxicity .

[ 49 ] Pharmacology – branch of medicine and biology concerned with the study of drug action, [ 50 ] where a drug can be broadly defined as any human-made, natural, or endogenous (within the body) molecule which exerts a biochemical and/or physiological effect on the cell, tissue, organ, or organism. More specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function. If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered pharmaceuticals .

Proteomics – the large-scale study of proteins , particularly their structures and functions .

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] Proteins are vital parts of living organisms, as they are the main components of the physiological metabolic pathways of cells . The proteome is the entire set of proteins, [ 53 ] produced or modified by an organism or system. This varies with time and distinct requirements, or stresses, that a cell or organism undergoes.
