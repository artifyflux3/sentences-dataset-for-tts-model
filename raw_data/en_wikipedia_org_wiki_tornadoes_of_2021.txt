Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States , Argentina , Brazil , Bangladesh , and Eastern India , but can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere 's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe , Asia , Argentina , Australia and New Zealand . Tornadic events are often accompanied by other forms of severe weather , including strong thunderstorms , strong winds , and hail . Worldwide, 150 tornado-related deaths were confirmed with 103 in the United States, 28 in China , six in the Czech Republic , four in Russia , three in Italy , two in India , and one each in Canada, New Zealand, Indonesia , and Turkey .

The year started well below average with the lowest amount of tornado reports through the first two months in the past 16 years and remained below-average for most of the year due to inactivity during April, June, September, and November.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Despite this, several intense outbreaks occurred in March, May, July, August, and October. The year ended on a destructive note, however, as December was incredibly active, more than doubling the previous record, which pushed 2021 above average. Additionally, 2021 had the most tornado fatalities in the United States since 2011 .

The deadliest December tornado outbreak in United States history caused catastrophic damage and numerous fatalities, as multiple strong to violent long-tracked tornadoes devastated portions of the Southern United States and Ohio Valley from the evening of December 10, into the early morning hours of December 11. The event came to fruition as a trough progressed eastward across the United States, interacting with an unseasonably moist, unstable, and highly sheared environment across the Mississippi Valley . The SPC had issued a moderate risk of severe weather prior to the outbreak, including a 15% hatched risk area for tornadoes. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed, and tornadic activity began later that evening in northeastern Arkansas , before progressing into Missouri , Illinois , Tennessee , and Kentucky . A high-end EF3 tornado damaged or destroyed multiple homes near Defiance, Missouri , killing one person and injuring two others. An EF3 tornado also destroyed an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois , killing six employees. Several other strong EF2 tornadoes touched down in more rural areas of Illinois with one of them tearing the roof off of a house, flipping tanker trucks, and destroying buildings at an agricultural services plant near Gays . Farther south, another EF2 tornado destroyed homes, mobile homes, and a vacant grocery story building in Trumann, Arkansas , and damaged the town's fire department building.

[ 82 ] EF4 damage to well-built brick buildings in downtown Mayfield, Kentucky.

The most significant tornadoes of the outbreak were spawned by a long-tracked supercell thunderstorm that produced a violent tornado family across four states.

[ 193 ] Initially, media reports suggested that the tornado family, which was inaccurately identified by some media outlets as the "Quad-State tornado" due to the storm's similar characteristics to the Tri-State tornado of 1925 , may have actually been a single, extremely long-tracked tornado that cut a path of destruction of up to 250 miles (400 km) from near Bay, Arkansas , to Rough River Lake in Kentucky.

[ 194 ] However, a path break in Obion County, Tennessee , confirmed two separate EF4 tornadoes, one tracking 81.2 miles (130.7 km) and the other tracking 165.7 miles (266.7 km). The first of these tornadoes first caused major damage in the Arkansas towns of Monette and Leachville , as many homes and businesses were destroyed in both towns. The tornado crossed into the Missouri Bootheel , where homes were swept completely away near Braggadocio , and semi-trucks were thrown from roadways near Hayti before it crossed the Mississippi River into Tennessee. There, many other structures were completely destroyed at a resort along the shores of Reelfoot Lake , and in Samburg . A total of eight people were killed by this first tornado, and 16 others were injured. The second violent tornado, which was rated high-end EF4, caused catastrophic damage and 57 fatalities as it tore through the towns of Cayce , Mayfield , Princeton , Dawson Springs , and Bremen . Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed along the path, many of which were leveled or swept from their foundations. Trees were debarked, vehicles were thrown and mangled, severe ground scouring occurred, and 24 people were killed in Mayfield and surrounding Graves County alone. Mayfield sustained near-total destruction of its historic downtown square, and nine of the fatalities occurred at a candle factory that was flattened in the southwest part of town.

[ 82 ] [ 195 ] [ 196 ] The city of Bowling Green, Kentucky , sustained major damage as it was struck by a high-end EF3 tornado during the very early morning hours of December 11, which destroyed numerous homes, and inflicted severe structural damage to townhouses and apartment buildings as it moved through multiple neighborhoods. Many businesses also sustained severe damage or were destroyed, including the GM Corvette Assembly Plant , which had much of its roofing torn off. The main Bowling Green tornado was accompanied by an EF2 satellite tornado that caused additional significant damage in the city. The supercell that produced the two Bowling Green tornadoes also produced an EF3 tornado that destroyed a dairy farm, homes and mobile homes, chicken houses, and a metal truss tower near Russellville . Another long-tracked, high-end EF3 tornado caused severe damage to homes in Kenton, Tennessee , before destroying many homes and businesses in Dresden , where major structural damage occurred in the downtown area. It continued past Dresden and eventually crossed into Kentucky, where additional significant damage occurred in the town of Pembroke before the tornado dissipated, resulting in 34 injuries but no fatalities along its path. Yet another EF3 tornado destroyed houses, tossed vehicles, killed one person, and injured 31 others near Saloma, Kentucky , while an EF2 tornado heavily damaged hotels, restaurants, and a trailer park in Cave City . Overall, this outbreak produced a total of 71 tornadoes, resulting in 89 fatalities and over 650 injuries.

A large and powerful low-pressure system that had previously produced heavy rain and snow to the Western United States the previous two days rapidly deepened and contributed to a historic expanse of inclement weather on December 15. On the west side of the system, a destructive wind storm impacted Colorado and Kansas . In Colorado, a 107 mph (172 km/h) wind gust was recorded in Lamar with widespread power outages and damage to homes recorded elsewhere. In Kansas, the intense winds led to substantial amounts of dust being stirred up. The massive dust storms closed several highways and led to numerous crashes along Interstate 70 , including two crashes that resulted in three fatalities. The wind storms also contributed to an outbreak of wildfires in the drought-stricken north-central part of the state with 163,755 acres (66,269 ha) of land being burned across the region.

[ 199 ] The wildfires burned numerous buildings and killed hundreds of livestock. Two men were killed as a result of being burned and three other people were hospitalized due to their injuries. (These casualties were labeled as indirect.) [ 200 ] [ 201 ] On the warm side of the system, an intense derecho struck areas of the Midwest, including Kansas, Nebraska , Iowa , Wisconsin , and Minnesota . In Russell, Kansas , wind gusts measured at 100 mph (160 km/h) blew roofs off homes and uprooted trees while Lincoln Airport in Lincoln, Nebraska , measured peak winds of 93 mph (150 km/h). At least 57 hurricane-force wind reports were received by the National Weather Service, signaling the most prolific wind event in the United States dating back to at least 2004.

[ 202 ] A semi-truck on US 151 near Walford, Iowa , was blown over, ejecting and fatally injuring the driver who was not wearing a seatbelt.

[ 202 ] [ 203 ] The derecho was also a prolific tornado producer with dozens of tornado touchdowns being confirmed in Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, including several strong tornadoes in the Omaha metropolitan area and across Guthrie , Greene , and Webster counties in Iowa. Although none of the tornadoes exceeded EF2 intensity, 33 of the tornadoes were given this rating, which was 10 more than the amount of EF2+ tornadoes that occurred in the outbreak a few days prior . One EF2 tornado struck Columbus, Nebraska , causing minor to heavy damage to homes, snapping power lines, and damaging trees. It was the only tornado of the event to cause casualties as two people were injured.

[ 204 ] The tornado outbreak set a new record for the most tornadoes to hit Iowa in a single day with 61, far exceeding the previous record of 35 tornadoes set on August 31, 2014 . Additionally, 21 of the tornadoes in Iowa were rated EF2 which beat the previous record of 16 EF2/F2 or greater tornadoes set on June 7, 1984 . Prior to this event, there had only been five December tornadoes in Iowa, all in southeast Iowa.

[ 205 ] This outbreak also marked the first time that tornadoes were recorded in Minnesota in the month of December.

[ 206 ] Additionally, it was the first time since record keeping began in 1986 that the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Sioux Falls, South Dakota , had to issue both severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings during the month of December, with 6 and 8 issued, respectively. All of the severe storms took place in their coverage area in northwest Iowa.

[ 207 ] Total damage from the tornado outbreak amounted to at least $16.6 million in damage.

[ 208 ] Although the tornadoes were not as intense as the ones produced by the outbreak a few days prior, this event produced the most total confirmed tornadoes ever recorded in a December outbreak, with 120 in total. Ultimately, this became one of the largest single-day tornado outbreaks–in terms of number of confirmed tornadoes–in recorded history.

[ 209 ] Temperatures behind the derecho also dropped tremendously across the region, leading to light snow that was accompanied by strong winds. This triggered the first issuance of snow squall warnings by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Hastings, Nebraska . As a whole, the event caused seven total deaths and at least $1.8 billion in damage.

The first tornado touched down near Baochang in Inner Mongolia before devastating the small village of Jianguo at high-end EF3 strength, completely leveling brick homes, debarking trees, tossing cars and farm implements, producing ground scouring in open fields, and killing at least six people. After the initial tornado dissipated, a second tornado touched down and struck Guyuan in Hebei Province , leveling additional homes and structures, causing major tree damage, and killing two others. A third significant tornado caused severe damage to homes near Fengning in Hebei Province , including some that sustained loss of roofs and exterior walls. A fourth tornado that blew over metal truss transmission towers, ripped roofs off of homes, and downed power poles was also confirmed in a rural area. Only the first tornado was officially rated.

Tractors and farm implements were thrown as well. The following day, a large and slow-moving EF3 stovepipe tornado moved through remote, mountainous terrain in Inner Mongolia , completely mowing down large swaths of trees in densely forested areas. Extreme tree damage was noted, with all trees stripped of limbs and bark in the most severely impacted areas, and some were reduced to debarked stumps. Ground scouring occurred, and large metal truss transmission towers were ripped from their footings, thrown, and torn apart as well.

The tornado threw vehicles and snapped concrete power poles before moving into more populated areas of Gaotang, causing severe damage to homes and other structures. In Binzhou , a tornado snapped concrete power poles, damaged industrial buildings, flipped vehicles, and destroyed several manufactured homes. Major damage and at least one fatality was also reported in the Zhanhua area, where another apparent strong tornado completely destroyed several brick homes and a furniture factory. On July 13, tornadic activity continued as a large wedge tornado moved through areas near Zalantun , causing significant damage in several villages. Most of the tornadoes that occurred as a result of this outbreak were never officially rated, though analysis indicated that several of them produced damage consistent with at least EF2 or EF3 strength. One fatality and at least 11 tornadoes were confirmed as a result of this outbreak, though many other tornadoes and fatalities are suspected to have occurred.

Brick fencing was blown over, and projectiles were driven into the exterior walls of structures as well. A high-end EF2 tornado also touched down in a rural area outside of Jinzhou , knocking down metal truss electrical transmission towers, and snapping or uprooting many hardwood trees, a few of which sustained some low-end debarking. Power poles were snapped, vehicles were damaged, and a brick outbuilding was destroyed. Farm fields were also scoured by the tornado.

[ 280 ] [ 281 ] December 2 (Indonesia) [ edit ] A tornado spawned by a severe thunderstorm struck Parakan , Temanggung , Central Java . The tornado caused significant damage to five homes and two religious places. There were no fatalities or injuries as a result of this tornado.

[ 282 ] Elsewhere [ edit ] June 19 (New Zealand) [ edit ] On the morning of June 19, a tornado moved through the densely populated Auckland suburb of Papatoetoe , causing extensive damage. A stack of large metal shipping containers was blown over at a freight hub, and a worker was killed at this location after being picked up and thrown by the tornado. Numerous homes sustained severe roof damage and broken windows, and a few houses had large portions of their roofs torn off. A two-story apartment building had its entire roof ripped off, a church building lost a large portion of its roof, vehicles were overturned, and many trees were downed. Power poles were also toppled to the ground, fences were destroyed, and sheet metal was wrapped around power lines.
