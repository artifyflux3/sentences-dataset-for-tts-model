Application (or repeated application) of the rule often converts an indeterminate form to an expression that can be easily evaluated by substitution. The rule is named after the 17th-century French mathematician Guillaume de l'Hôpital . Although the rule is often attributed to de l'Hôpital, the theorem was first introduced to him in 1694 by the Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli .

L'Hôpital's rule states that for functions f and g which are defined on an open interval I and differentiable on I ∖ ∖ { c } {\textstyle I\setminus \{c\}} for a (possibly infinite) accumulation point c of I , if lim x → → c f ( x ) = lim x → → c g ( x ) = 0 or ± ± ∞ ∞ , {\textstyle \lim \limits _{x\to c}f(x)=\lim \limits _{x\to c}g(x)=0{\text{ or }}\pm \infty ,} and g ′ ( x ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\textstyle g'(x)\neq 0} for all x in I ∖ ∖ { c } {\textstyle I\setminus \{c\}} , and lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) {\textstyle \lim \limits _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}} exists, then lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) = lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}=\lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}.} The differentiation of the numerator and denominator often simplifies the quotient or converts it to a limit that can be directly evaluated by continuity .

History [ edit ] Guillaume de l'Hôpital (also written l'Hospital [ a ] ) published this rule in his 1696 book Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes (literal translation: Analysis of the Infinitely Small for the Understanding of Curved Lines ), the first textbook on differential calculus .

[ 1 ] [ b ] However, it is believed that the rule was discovered by the Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli .

[ 3 ] General form [ edit ] The general form of l'Hôpital's rule covers many cases. Let c and L be extended real numbers : real numbers, as well as positive and negative infinity. Let I be an open interval containing c (for a two-sided limit) or an open interval with endpoint c (for a one-sided limit , or a limit at infinity if c is infinite). On I ∖ ∖ { c } {\displaystyle I\smallsetminus \{c\}} , the real-valued functions f and g are assumed differentiable with g ′ ( x ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle g'(x)\neq 0} . It is also assumed that lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) = L {\textstyle \lim \limits _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}=L} , a finite or infinite limit.

If either lim x → → c f ( x ) = lim x → → c g ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=\lim _{x\to c}g(x)=0} or lim x → → c | f ( x ) | = lim x → → c | g ( x ) | = ∞ ∞ , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}|f(x)|=\lim _{x\to c}|g(x)|=\infty ,} then lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) = L .

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}=L.} Although we have written x → c throughout, the limits may also be one-sided limits ( x → c + or x → c − ), when c is a finite endpoint of I .

In the second case, the hypothesis that f diverges to infinity is not necessary; in fact, it is sufficient that lim x → → c | g ( x ) | = ∞ ∞ .

{\textstyle \lim _{x\to c}|g(x)|=\infty .} The hypothesis that g ′ ( x ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle g'(x)\neq 0} appears most commonly in the literature, but some authors sidestep this hypothesis by adding other hypotheses which imply g ′ ( x ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle g'(x)\neq 0} . For example, [ 4 ] one may require in the definition of the limit lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) = L {\textstyle \lim \limits _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}=L} that the function f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) {\textstyle {\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}} must be defined everywhere on an interval I ∖ ∖ { c } {\displaystyle I\smallsetminus \{c\}} .

[ c ] Another method [ 5 ] is to require that both f and g be differentiable everywhere on an interval containing c .

Necessity of conditions: Counterexamples [ edit ] All four conditions for l'Hôpital's rule are necessary: Indeterminacy of form: lim x → → c f ( x ) = lim x → → c g ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=\lim _{x\to c}g(x)=0} or ± ± ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \pm \infty } ; Differentiability of functions: f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} and g ( x ) {\displaystyle g(x)} are differentiable on an open interval I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} except possibly at the limit point c {\displaystyle c} in I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} ; Non-zero derivative of denominator: g ′ ( x ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle g'(x)\neq 0} for all x {\displaystyle x} in I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} with x ≠ ≠ c {\displaystyle x\neq c} ; Existence of limit of the quotient of the derivatives: lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}} exists.

Where one of the above conditions is not satisfied, l'Hôpital's rule is not valid in general, and its conclusion may be false in certain cases.

1. Form is not indeterminate [ edit ] The necessity of the first condition can be seen by considering the counterexample where the functions are f ( x ) = x + 1 {\displaystyle f(x)=x+1} and g ( x ) = 2 x + 1 {\displaystyle g(x)=2x+1} and the limit is x → → 1 {\displaystyle x\to 1} .

The first condition is not satisfied for this counterexample because lim x → → 1 f ( x ) = lim x → → 1 ( x + 1 ) = ( 1 ) + 1 = 2 ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 1}f(x)=\lim _{x\to 1}(x+1)=(1)+1=2\neq 0} and lim x → → 1 g ( x ) = lim x → → 1 ( 2 x + 1 ) = 2 ( 1 ) + 1 = 3 ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 1}g(x)=\lim _{x\to 1}(2x+1)=2(1)+1=3\neq 0} . This means that the form is not indeterminate.

The second and third conditions are satisfied by f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} and g ( x ) {\displaystyle g(x)} . The fourth condition is also satisfied with lim x → → 1 f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) = lim x → → 1 ( x + 1 ) ′ ( 2 x + 1 ) ′ = lim x → → 1 1 2 = 1 2 .

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 1}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}=\lim _{x\to 1}{\frac {(x+1)'}{(2x+1)'}}=\lim _{x\to 1}{\frac {1}{2}}={\frac {1}{2}}.} But the conclusion fails, since lim x → → 1 f ( x ) g ( x ) = lim x → → 1 x + 1 2 x + 1 = lim x → → 1 ( x + 1 ) lim x → → 1 ( 2 x + 1 ) = 2 3 ≠ ≠ 1 2 .

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 1}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}=\lim _{x\to 1}{\frac {x+1}{2x+1}}={\frac {\lim _{x\to 1}(x+1)}{\lim _{x\to 1}(2x+1)}}={\frac {2}{3}}\neq {\frac {1}{2}}.} 2. Differentiability of functions [ edit ] Differentiability of functions is a requirement because if a function is not differentiable, then the derivative of the function is not guaranteed to exist at each point in I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} . The fact that I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} is an open interval is grandfathered in from the hypothesis of the Cauchy's mean value theorem . The notable exception of the possibility of the functions being not differentiable at c {\displaystyle c} exists because l'Hôpital's rule only requires the derivative to exist as the function approaches c {\displaystyle c} ; the derivative does not need to be taken at c {\displaystyle c} .

For example, let f ( x ) = { sin ⁡ ⁡ x , x ≠ ≠ 0 1 , x = 0 {\displaystyle f(x)={\begin{cases}\sin x,&x\neq 0\\1,&x=0\end{cases}}} , g ( x ) = x {\displaystyle g(x)=x} , and c = 0 {\displaystyle c=0} . In this case, f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} is not differentiable at c {\displaystyle c} . However, since f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} is differentiable everywhere except c {\displaystyle c} , then lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f'(x)} still exists. Thus, since lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) = 0 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}={\frac {0}{0}}} and lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}} exists, l'Hôpital's rule still holds.

3. Derivative of denominator is zero [ edit ] The necessity of the condition that g ′ ( x ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle g'(x)\neq 0} near c {\displaystyle c} can be seen by the following counterexample due to Otto Stolz .

[ 6 ] Let f ( x ) = x + sin ⁡ ⁡ x cos ⁡ ⁡ x {\displaystyle f(x)=x+\sin x\cos x} and g ( x ) = f ( x ) e sin ⁡ ⁡ x .

{\displaystyle g(x)=f(x)e^{\sin x}.} Then there is no limit for f ( x ) / g ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)/g(x)} as x → → ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle x\to \infty .} However, f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) = 2 cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ x ( 2 cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ x ) e sin ⁡ ⁡ x + ( x + sin ⁡ ⁡ x cos ⁡ ⁡ x ) e sin ⁡ ⁡ x cos ⁡ ⁡ x = 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ x 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ x + x + sin ⁡ ⁡ x cos ⁡ ⁡ x e − − sin ⁡ ⁡ x , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}&={\frac {2\cos ^{2}x}{(2\cos ^{2}x)e^{\sin x}+(x+\sin x\cos x)e^{\sin x}\cos x}}\\&={\frac {2\cos x}{2\cos x+x+\sin x\cos x}}e^{-\sin x},\end{aligned}}} which tends to 0 as x → → ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle x\to \infty } , although it is undefined at infinitely many points. Further examples of this type were found by Ralph P. Boas Jr.

[ 7 ] 4. Limit of derivatives does not exist [ edit ] The requirement that the limit lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}} exists is essential; if it does not exist, the original limit lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}} may nevertheless exist. Indeed, as x {\displaystyle x} approaches c {\displaystyle c} , the functions f {\displaystyle f} or g {\displaystyle g} may exhibit many oscillations of small amplitude but steep slope, which do not affect lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}} but do prevent the convergence of lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}} .

For example, if f ( x ) = x + sin ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)=x+\sin(x)} , g ( x ) = x {\displaystyle g(x)=x} and c = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle c=\infty } , then f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) = 1 + cos ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) 1 , {\displaystyle {\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}={\frac {1+\cos(x)}{1}},} which does not approach a limit since cosine oscillates infinitely between 1 and −1 . But the ratio of the original functions does approach a limit, since the amplitude of the oscillations of f {\displaystyle f} becomes small relative to g {\displaystyle g} : lim x → → ∞ ∞ f ( x ) g ( x ) = lim x → → ∞ ∞ ( x + sin ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) x ) = lim x → → ∞ ∞ ( 1 + sin ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) x ) = 1 + 0 = 1.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}=\lim _{x\to \infty }\left({\frac {x+\sin(x)}{x}}\right)=\lim _{x\to \infty }\left(1+{\frac {\sin(x)}{x}}\right)=1+0=1.} In a case such as this, all that can be concluded is that lim inf x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) ≤ ≤ lim inf x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) ≤ ≤ lim sup x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) ≤ ≤ lim sup x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) , {\displaystyle \liminf _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}\leq \liminf _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}\leq \limsup _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}\leq \limsup _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}},} so that if the limit of f g {\textstyle {\frac {f}{g}}} exists, then it must lie between the inferior and superior limits of f ′ g ′ {\textstyle {\frac {f'}{g'}}} .  In the example, 1 does indeed lie between 0 and 2.) Note also that by the contrapositive form of the Rule, if lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}} does not exist, then lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}} also does not exist.

Examples [ edit ] In the following computations, each application of l'Hôpital's rule is indicated by the symbol = H {\displaystyle \ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ } .

Here is a basic example involving the exponential function, which involves the indeterminate form ⁠ 0 / 0 ⁠ at x = 0 : lim x → → 0 e x − − 1 x 2 + x = H lim x → → 0 d d x ( e x − − 1 ) d d x ( x 2 + x ) = lim x → → 0 e x 2 x + 1 = 1.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {e^{x}-1}{x^{2}+x}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {{\frac {d}{dx}}(e^{x}-1)}{{\frac {d}{dx}}(x^{2}+x)}}=\lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {e^{x}}{2x+1}}=1.} This is a more elaborate example involving ⁠ 0 / 0 ⁠ . Applying l'Hôpital's rule a single time still results in an indeterminate form. In this case, the limit may be evaluated by applying the rule three times: lim x → → 0 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) − − sin ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 x ) x − − sin ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) = H lim x → → 0 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) − − 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 x ) 1 − − cos ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) = H lim x → → 0 − − 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) + 4 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 x ) sin ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) = H lim x → → 0 − − 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) + 8 cos ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 x ) cos ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) = − − 2 + 8 1 = 6.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {2\sin(x)-\sin(2x)}{x-\sin(x)}}&\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {2\cos(x)-2\cos(2x)}{1-\cos(x)}}\\[4pt]&\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {-2\sin(x)+4\sin(2x)}{\sin(x)}}\\[4pt]&\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {-2\cos(x)+8\cos(2x)}{\cos(x)}}={\frac {-2+8}{1}}=6.\end{aligned}}} Here is an example involving ⁠ ∞ / ∞ ⁠ : lim x → → ∞ ∞ x n ⋅ ⋅ e − − x = lim x → → ∞ ∞ x n e x = H lim x → → ∞ ∞ n x n − − 1 e x = n ⋅ ⋅ lim x → → ∞ ∞ x n − − 1 e x .

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }x^{n}\cdot e^{-x}=\lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {x^{n}}{e^{x}}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {nx^{n-1}}{e^{x}}}=n\cdot \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {x^{n-1}}{e^{x}}}.} Repeatedly apply l'Hôpital's rule until the exponent is zero (if n is an integer) or negative (if n is fractional) to conclude that the limit is zero.

Here is an example involving the indeterminate form 0 · ∞ (see below), which is rewritten as the form ⁠ ∞ / ∞ ⁠ : lim x → → 0 + x ln ⁡ ⁡ x = lim x → → 0 + ln ⁡ ⁡ x 1 x = H lim x → → 0 + 1 x − − 1 x 2 = lim x → → 0 + − − x = 0.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}x\ln x=\lim _{x\to 0^{+}}{\frac {\ln x}{\frac {1}{x}}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}{\frac {\frac {1}{x}}{-{\frac {1}{x^{2}}}}}=\lim _{x\to 0^{+}}-x=0.} Here is an example involving the mortgage repayment formula and ⁠ 0 / 0 ⁠ . Let P be the principal (loan amount), r the interest rate per period and n the number of periods.  When r is zero, the repayment amount per period is P n {\displaystyle {\frac {P}{n}}} (since only principal is being repaid); this is consistent with the formula for non-zero interest rates: lim r → → 0 P r ( 1 + r ) n ( 1 + r ) n − − 1 = H P lim r → → 0 ( 1 + r ) n + r n ( 1 + r ) n − − 1 n ( 1 + r ) n − − 1 = P n .

{\displaystyle \lim _{r\to 0}{\frac {Pr(1+r)^{n}}{(1+r)^{n}-1}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ P\lim _{r\to 0}{\frac {(1+r)^{n}+rn(1+r)^{n-1}}{n(1+r)^{n-1}}}={\frac {P}{n}}.} One can also use l'Hôpital's rule to prove the following theorem. If f is twice-differentiable in a neighborhood of x and its second derivative is continuous on this neighborhood, then lim h → → 0 f ( x + h ) + f ( x − − h ) − − 2 f ( x ) h 2 = lim h → → 0 f ′ ( x + h ) − − f ′ ( x − − h ) 2 h = lim h → → 0 f ″ ( x + h ) + f ″ ( x − − h ) 2 = f ″ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {f(x+h)+f(x-h)-2f(x)}{h^{2}}}&=\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {f'(x+h)-f'(x-h)}{2h}}\\[4pt]&=\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {f''(x+h)+f''(x-h)}{2}}\\[4pt]&=f''(x).\end{aligned}}} Sometimes l'Hôpital's rule is invoked in a tricky way: suppose f ( x ) + f ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)+f'(x)} converges as x → ∞ and that e x ⋅ ⋅ f ( x ) {\displaystyle e^{x}\cdot f(x)} converges to positive or negative infinity. Then: lim x → → ∞ ∞ f ( x ) = lim x → → ∞ ∞ e x ⋅ ⋅ f ( x ) e x = H lim x → → ∞ ∞ e x ( f ( x ) + f ′ ( x ) ) e x = lim x → → ∞ ∞ ( f ( x ) + f ′ ( x ) ) , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }f(x)=\lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {e^{x}\cdot f(x)}{e^{x}}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {e^{x}{\bigl (}f(x)+f'(x){\bigr )}}{e^{x}}}=\lim _{x\to \infty }{\bigl (}f(x)+f'(x){\bigr )},} and so, lim x → → ∞ ∞ f ( x ) {\textstyle \lim _{x\to \infty }f(x)} exists and lim x → → ∞ ∞ f ′ ( x ) = 0.

{\textstyle \lim _{x\to \infty }f'(x)=0.} (This result remains true without the added hypothesis that e x ⋅ ⋅ f ( x ) {\displaystyle e^{x}\cdot f(x)} converges to positive or negative infinity, but the justification is then incomplete.) Complications [ edit ] Sometimes L'Hôpital's rule does not reduce to an obvious limit in a finite number of steps, unless some intermediate simplifications are applied. Examples include the following: Two applications can lead to a return to the original expression that was to be evaluated: lim x → → ∞ ∞ e x + e − − x e x − − e − − x = H lim x → → ∞ ∞ e x − − e − − x e x + e − − x = H lim x → → ∞ ∞ e x + e − − x e x − − e − − x = H ⋯ ⋯ .

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {e^{x}+e^{-x}}{e^{x}-e^{-x}}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {e^{x}-e^{-x}}{e^{x}+e^{-x}}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {e^{x}+e^{-x}}{e^{x}-e^{-x}}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \cdots .} This situation can be dealt with by substituting y = e x {\displaystyle y=e^{x}} and noting that y goes to infinity as x goes to infinity; with this substitution, this problem can be solved with a single application of the rule: lim x → → ∞ ∞ e x + e − − x e x − − e − − x = lim y → → ∞ ∞ y + y − − 1 y − − y − − 1 = H lim y → → ∞ ∞ 1 − − y − − 2 1 + y − − 2 = 1 1 = 1.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {e^{x}+e^{-x}}{e^{x}-e^{-x}}}=\lim _{y\to \infty }{\frac {y+y^{-1}}{y-y^{-1}}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{y\to \infty }{\frac {1-y^{-2}}{1+y^{-2}}}={\frac {1}{1}}=1.} Alternatively, the numerator and denominator can both be multiplied by e x , {\displaystyle e^{x},} at which point L'Hôpital's rule can immediately be applied successfully: [ 8 ] lim x → → ∞ ∞ e x + e − − x e x − − e − − x = lim x → → ∞ ∞ e 2 x + 1 e 2 x − − 1 = H lim x → → ∞ ∞ 2 e 2 x 2 e 2 x = 1.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {e^{x}+e^{-x}}{e^{x}-e^{-x}}}=\lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {e^{2x}+1}{e^{2x}-1}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {2e^{2x}}{2e^{2x}}}=1.} An arbitrarily large number of applications may never lead to an answer even without repeating: lim x → → ∞ ∞ x 1 2 + x − − 1 2 x 1 2 − − x − − 1 2 = H lim x → → ∞ ∞ 1 2 x − − 1 2 − − 1 2 x − − 3 2 1 2 x − − 1 2 + 1 2 x − − 3 2 = H lim x → → ∞ ∞ − − 1 4 x − − 3 2 + 3 4 x − − 5 2 − − 1 4 x − − 3 2 − − 3 4 x − − 5 2 = H ⋯ ⋯ .

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {x^{\frac {1}{2}}+x^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}}{x^{\frac {1}{2}}-x^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {{\frac {1}{2}}x^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{2}}x^{-{\frac {3}{2}}}}{{\frac {1}{2}}x^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}+{\frac {1}{2}}x^{-{\frac {3}{2}}}}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {-{\frac {1}{4}}x^{-{\frac {3}{2}}}+{\frac {3}{4}}x^{-{\frac {5}{2}}}}{-{\frac {1}{4}}x^{-{\frac {3}{2}}}-{\frac {3}{4}}x^{-{\frac {5}{2}}}}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \cdots .} This situation too can be dealt with by a transformation of variables, in this case y = x {\displaystyle y={\sqrt {x}}} : lim x → → ∞ ∞ x 1 2 + x − − 1 2 x 1 2 − − x − − 1 2 = lim y → → ∞ ∞ y + y − − 1 y − − y − − 1 = H lim y → → ∞ ∞ 1 − − y − − 2 1 + y − − 2 = 1 1 = 1.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {x^{\frac {1}{2}}+x^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}}{x^{\frac {1}{2}}-x^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}}}=\lim _{y\to \infty }{\frac {y+y^{-1}}{y-y^{-1}}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{y\to \infty }{\frac {1-y^{-2}}{1+y^{-2}}}={\frac {1}{1}}=1.} Again, an alternative approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by x 1 / 2 {\displaystyle x^{1/2}} before applying L'Hôpital's rule: lim x → → ∞ ∞ x 1 2 + x − − 1 2 x 1 2 − − x − − 1 2 = lim x → → ∞ ∞ x + 1 x − − 1 = H lim x → → ∞ ∞ 1 1 = 1.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {x^{\frac {1}{2}}+x^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}}{x^{\frac {1}{2}}-x^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}}}=\lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {x+1}{x-1}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {1}{1}}=1.} A common logical fallacy is to use L'Hôpital's rule to prove the value of a derivative by computing the limit of a difference quotient . Since applying l'Hôpital requires knowing the relevant derivatives, this amounts to circular reasoning or begging the question , assuming what is to be proved. For example, consider the proof of the derivative formula for powers of x : lim h → → 0 ( x + h ) n − − x n h = n x n − − 1 .

{\displaystyle \lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {(x+h)^{n}-x^{n}}{h}}=nx^{n-1}.} Applying L'Hôpital's rule and finding the derivatives with respect to h yields nx n −1 as expected, but this computation requires the use of the very formula that is being proven. Similarly, to prove lim x → → 0 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) x = 1 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {\sin(x)}{x}}=1} , applying L'Hôpital requires knowing the derivative of sin ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) {\displaystyle \sin(x)} at x = 0 {\displaystyle x=0} , which amounts to calculating lim h → → 0 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( h ) h {\displaystyle \lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {\sin(h)}{h}}} in the first place; a valid proof requires a different method such as the squeeze theorem .

Other indeterminate forms [ edit ] Other indeterminate forms, such as 1 ∞ , 0 0 , ∞ 0 , 0 · ∞ , and ∞ − ∞ , can sometimes be evaluated using L'Hôpital's rule. We again indicate applications of L'Hopital's rule by = H {\displaystyle \ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ } .

For example, to evaluate a limit involving ∞ − ∞ , convert the difference of two functions to a quotient: lim x → → 1 ( x x − − 1 − − 1 ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) = lim x → → 1 x ⋅ ⋅ ln ⁡ ⁡ x − − x + 1 ( x − − 1 ) ⋅ ⋅ ln ⁡ ⁡ x = H lim x → → 1 ln ⁡ ⁡ x x − − 1 x + ln ⁡ ⁡ x = lim x → → 1 x ⋅ ⋅ ln ⁡ ⁡ x x − − 1 + x ⋅ ⋅ ln ⁡ ⁡ x = H lim x → → 1 1 + ln ⁡ ⁡ x 1 + 1 + ln ⁡ ⁡ x = 1 + 0 1 + 1 + 0 .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lim _{x\to 1}\left({\frac {x}{x-1}}-{\frac {1}{\ln x}}\right)&=\lim _{x\to 1}{\frac {x\cdot \ln x-x+1}{(x-1)\cdot \ln x}}\\[6pt]&\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to 1}{\frac {\ln x}{{\frac {x-1}{x}}+\ln x}}\\[6pt]&=\lim _{x\to 1}{\frac {x\cdot \ln x}{x-1+x\cdot \ln x}}\\[6pt]&\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {H} }{=}}\ \lim _{x\to 1}{\frac {1+\ln x}{1+1+\ln x}}={\frac {1+0}{1+1+0}}.\end{aligned}}} L'Hôpital's rule can be used on indeterminate forms involving exponents by using logarithms to "move the exponent down". Here is an example involving the indeterminate form 0 0 : lim x → → 0 + x x = lim x → → 0 + e ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x x ) = lim x → → 0 + e x ⋅ ⋅ ln ⁡ ⁡ x = lim x → → 0 + exp ⁡ ⁡ ( x ⋅ ⋅ ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( lim x → → 0 + x ⋅ ⋅ ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) .

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}\!}x^{x}=\lim _{x\to 0^{+}\!}e^{\ln(x^{x})}=\lim _{x\to 0^{+}\!}e^{x\cdot \ln x}=\lim _{x\to 0^{+}\!}\exp(x\cdot \ln x)=\exp({\lim \limits _{x\to 0^{+}\!\!}\,x\cdot \ln x}).} It is valid to move the limit inside the exponential function because this function is continuous . Now the exponent x {\displaystyle x} has been "moved down". The limit lim x → → 0 + x ⋅ ⋅ ln ⁡ ⁡ x {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}x\cdot \ln x} is of the indeterminate form 0 · ∞ dealt with in an example above: L'Hôpital may be used to determine that lim x → → 0 + x ⋅ ⋅ ln ⁡ ⁡ x = 0.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}x\cdot \ln x=0.} Thus lim x → → 0 + x x = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( 0 ) = e 0 = 1.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}x^{x}=\exp(0)=e^{0}=1.} The following table lists the most common indeterminate forms and the transformations which precede applying l'Hôpital's rule: Indeterminate form with f & g Conditions Transformation to 0 / 0 {\displaystyle 0/0} ⁠ 0 / 0 ⁠ lim x → → c f ( x ) = 0 , lim x → → c g ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=0,\ \lim _{x\to c}g(x)=0\!} — ⁠ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } / ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } ⁠ lim x → → c f ( x ) = ∞ ∞ , lim x → → c g ( x ) = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=\infty ,\ \lim _{x\to c}g(x)=\infty \!} lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) = lim x → → c 1 / g ( x ) 1 / f ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}=\lim _{x\to c}{\frac {1/g(x)}{1/f(x)}}\!} 0 ⋅ ⋅ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle 0\cdot \infty } lim x → → c f ( x ) = 0 , lim x → → c g ( x ) = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=0,\ \lim _{x\to c}g(x)=\infty \!} lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) = lim x → → c f ( x ) 1 / g ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)g(x)=\lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{1/g(x)}}\!} ∞ ∞ − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty -\infty } lim x → → c f ( x ) = ∞ ∞ , lim x → → c g ( x ) = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=\infty ,\ \lim _{x\to c}g(x)=\infty \!} lim x → → c ( f ( x ) − − g ( x ) ) = lim x → → c 1 / g ( x ) − − 1 / f ( x ) 1 / ( f ( x ) g ( x ) ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}(f(x)-g(x))=\lim _{x\to c}{\frac {1/g(x)-1/f(x)}{1/(f(x)g(x))}}\!} 0 0 {\displaystyle 0^{0}} lim x → → c f ( x ) = 0 + , lim x → → c g ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=0^{+},\lim _{x\to c}g(x)=0\!} lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ lim x → → c g ( x ) 1 / ln ⁡ ⁡ f ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)^{g(x)}=\exp \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {g(x)}{1/\ln f(x)}}\!} 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle 1^{\infty }} lim x → → c f ( x ) = 1 , lim x → → c g ( x ) = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=1,\ \lim _{x\to c}g(x)=\infty \!} lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ lim x → → c ln ⁡ ⁡ f ( x ) 1 / g ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)^{g(x)}=\exp \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {\ln f(x)}{1/g(x)}}\!} ∞ ∞ 0 {\displaystyle \infty ^{0}} lim x → → c f ( x ) = ∞ ∞ , lim x → → c g ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=\infty ,\ \lim _{x\to c}g(x)=0\!} lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ lim x → → c g ( x ) 1 / ln ⁡ ⁡ f ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)^{g(x)}=\exp \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {g(x)}{1/\ln f(x)}}\!} Stolz–Cesàro theorem [ edit ] Main article: Stolz–Cesàro theorem The Stolz–Cesàro theorem is a similar result involving limits of sequences, but it uses finite difference operators rather than derivatives .

Geometric interpretation: parametric curve and velocity vector [ edit ] Consider the parametric curve in the xy -plane with coordinates given by the continuous functions g ( t ) {\displaystyle g(t)} and f ( t ) {\displaystyle f(t)} , the locus of points ( g ( t ) , f ( t ) ) {\displaystyle (g(t),f(t))} , and suppose f ( c ) = g ( c ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(c)=g(c)=0} . The slope of the tangent to the curve at ( g ( c ) , f ( c ) ) = ( 0 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (g(c),f(c))=(0,0)} is the limit of the ratio f ( t ) g ( t ) {\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {f(t)}{g(t)}}} as t → c . The tangent to the curve at the point ( g ( t ) , f ( t ) ) {\displaystyle (g(t),f(t))} is the velocity vector ( g ′ ( t ) , f ′ ( t ) ) {\displaystyle (g'(t),f'(t))} with slope f ′ ( t ) g ′ ( t ) {\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {f'(t)}{g'(t)}}} . L'Hôpital's rule then states that the slope of the curve at the origin ( t = c ) is the limit of the tangent slope at points approaching the origin, provided that this is defined.

Proof of L'Hôpital's rule [ edit ] Special case [ edit ] The proof of L'Hôpital's rule is simple in the case where f and g are continuously differentiable at the point c and where a finite limit is found after the first round of differentiation. This is only a special case of L'Hôpital's rule, because it only applies to functions satisfying stronger conditions than required by the general rule. However, many common functions have continuous derivatives (e.g.

polynomials , sine and cosine , exponential functions ), so this special case covers most applications.

Suppose that f and g are continuously differentiable at a real number c , that f ( c ) = g ( c ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(c)=g(c)=0} , and that g ′ ( c ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle g'(c)\neq 0} . Then lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) = lim x → → c f ( x ) − − 0 g ( x ) − − 0 = lim x → → c f ( x ) − − f ( c ) g ( x ) − − g ( c ) = lim x → → c ( f ( x ) − − f ( c ) x − − c ) ( g ( x ) − − g ( c ) x − − c ) = lim x → → c ( f ( x ) − − f ( c ) x − − c ) lim x → → c ( g ( x ) − − g ( c ) x − − c ) = f ′ ( c ) g ′ ( c ) = lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}=\lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)-0}{g(x)-0}}=\lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)-f(c)}{g(x)-g(c)}}\\[6pt]={}&\lim _{x\to c}{\frac {\left({\frac {f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}}\right)}{\left({\frac {g(x)-g(c)}{x-c}}\right)}}={\frac {\lim \limits _{x\to c}\left({\frac {f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}}\right)}{\lim \limits _{x\to c}\left({\frac {g(x)-g(c)}{x-c}}\right)}}={\frac {f'(c)}{g'(c)}}=\lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}.\end{aligned}}} This follows from the difference quotient definition of the derivative. The last equality follows from the continuity of the derivatives at c . The limit in the conclusion is not indeterminate because g ′ ( c ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle g'(c)\neq 0} .

The proof of a more general version of L'Hôpital's rule is given below.

General proof [ edit ] The following proof is due to Taylor (1952) , where a unified proof for the 0 0 {\textstyle {\frac {0}{0}}} and ± ± ∞ ∞ ± ± ∞ ∞ {\textstyle {\frac {\pm \infty }{\pm \infty }}} indeterminate forms is given. Taylor notes that different proofs may be found in Lettenmeyer (1936) and Wazewski (1949) .

Let f and g be functions satisfying the hypotheses in the General form section. Let I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} be the open interval in the hypothesis with endpoint c . Considering that g ′ ( x ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle g'(x)\neq 0} on this interval and g is continuous, I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} can be chosen smaller so that g is nonzero on I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} .

[ d ] For each x in the interval, define m ( x ) = inf f ′ ( t ) g ′ ( t ) {\displaystyle m(x)=\inf {\frac {f'(t)}{g'(t)}}} and M ( x ) = sup f ′ ( t ) g ′ ( t ) {\displaystyle M(x)=\sup {\frac {f'(t)}{g'(t)}}} as t {\displaystyle t} ranges over all values between x and c . (The symbols inf and sup denote the infimum and supremum .) From the differentiability of f and g on I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} , Cauchy's mean value theorem ensures that for any two distinct points x and y in I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} there exists a ξ ξ {\displaystyle \xi } between x and y such that f ( x ) − − f ( y ) g ( x ) − − g ( y ) = f ′ ( ξ ξ ) g ′ ( ξ ξ ) {\displaystyle {\frac {f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}}={\frac {f'(\xi )}{g'(\xi )}}} . Consequently, m ( x ) ≤ ≤ f ( x ) − − f ( y ) g ( x ) − − g ( y ) ≤ ≤ M ( x ) {\displaystyle m(x)\leq {\frac {f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}}\leq M(x)} for all choices of distinct x and y in the interval. The value g ( x )- g ( y ) is always nonzero for distinct x and y in the interval, for if it was not, the mean value theorem would imply the existence of a p between x and y such that g' ( p )=0.

The definition of m ( x ) and M ( x ) will result in an extended real number, and so it is possible for them to take on the values ±∞.  In the following two cases, m ( x ) and M ( x ) will establish bounds on the ratio ⁠ f / g ⁠ .

Case 1: lim x → → c f ( x ) = lim x → → c g ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=\lim _{x\to c}g(x)=0} For any x in the interval I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} , and point y between x and c , m ( x ) ≤ ≤ f ( x ) − − f ( y ) g ( x ) − − g ( y ) = f ( x ) g ( x ) − − f ( y ) g ( x ) 1 − − g ( y ) g ( x ) ≤ ≤ M ( x ) {\displaystyle m(x)\leq {\frac {f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}}={\frac {{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}-{\frac {f(y)}{g(x)}}}{1-{\frac {g(y)}{g(x)}}}}\leq M(x)} and therefore as y approaches c , f ( y ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle {\frac {f(y)}{g(x)}}} and g ( y ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle {\frac {g(y)}{g(x)}}} become zero, and so m ( x ) ≤ ≤ f ( x ) g ( x ) ≤ ≤ M ( x ) .

{\displaystyle m(x)\leq {\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}\leq M(x).} Case 2: lim x → → c | g ( x ) | = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}|g(x)|=\infty } For every x in the interval I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} , define S x = { y ∣ ∣ y is between x and c } {\displaystyle S_{x}=\{y\mid y{\text{ is between }}x{\text{ and }}c\}} . For every point y between x and c , m ( x ) ≤ ≤ f ( y ) − − f ( x ) g ( y ) − − g ( x ) = f ( y ) g ( y ) − − f ( x ) g ( y ) 1 − − g ( x ) g ( y ) ≤ ≤ M ( x ) .

{\displaystyle m(x)\leq {\frac {f(y)-f(x)}{g(y)-g(x)}}={\frac {{\frac {f(y)}{g(y)}}-{\frac {f(x)}{g(y)}}}{1-{\frac {g(x)}{g(y)}}}}\leq M(x).} As y approaches c , both f ( x ) g ( y ) {\displaystyle {\frac {f(x)}{g(y)}}} and g ( x ) g ( y ) {\displaystyle {\frac {g(x)}{g(y)}}} become zero, and therefore m ( x ) ≤ ≤ lim inf y ∈ ∈ S x f ( y ) g ( y ) ≤ ≤ lim sup y ∈ ∈ S x f ( y ) g ( y ) ≤ ≤ M ( x ) .

{\displaystyle m(x)\leq \liminf _{y\in S_{x}}{\frac {f(y)}{g(y)}}\leq \limsup _{y\in S_{x}}{\frac {f(y)}{g(y)}}\leq M(x).} The limit superior and limit inferior are necessary since the existence of the limit of ⁠ f / g ⁠ has not yet been established.

It is also the case that lim x → → c m ( x ) = lim x → → c M ( x ) = lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) = L .

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}m(x)=\lim _{x\to c}M(x)=\lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}=L.} [ e ] and lim x → → c ( lim inf y ∈ ∈ S x f ( y ) g ( y ) ) = lim inf x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}\left(\liminf _{y\in S_{x}}{\frac {f(y)}{g(y)}}\right)=\liminf _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}} and lim x → → c ( lim sup y ∈ ∈ S x f ( y ) g ( y ) ) = lim sup x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}\left(\limsup _{y\in S_{x}}{\frac {f(y)}{g(y)}}\right)=\limsup _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}.} In case 1, the squeeze theorem establishes that lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}} exists and is equal to L . In the case 2, and the squeeze theorem again asserts that lim inf x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) = lim sup x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) = L {\displaystyle \liminf _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}=\limsup _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}=L} , and so the limit lim x → → c f ( x ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}} exists and is equal to L . This is the result that was to be proven.

In case 2 the assumption that f ( x ) diverges to infinity was not used within the proof. This means that if | g ( x )| diverges to infinity as x approaches c and both f and g satisfy the hypotheses of L'Hôpital's rule, then no additional assumption is needed about the limit of f ( x ): It could even be the case that the limit of f ( x ) does not exist. In this case, L'Hopital's theorem is actually a consequence of Cesàro–Stolz.

[ 9 ] In the case when | g ( x )| diverges to infinity as x approaches c and f ( x ) converges to a finite limit at c , then L'Hôpital's rule would be applicable, but not absolutely necessary, since basic limit calculus will show that the limit of f ( x )/ g ( x ) as x approaches c must be zero.

Corollary [ edit ] A simple but very useful consequence of L'Hopital's rule is that the derivative of a function cannot have a removable discontinuity. That is, suppose that f is continuous at a , and that f ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle f'(x)} exists for all x in some open interval containing a , except perhaps for x = a {\displaystyle x=a} . Suppose, moreover, that lim x → → a f ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a}f'(x)} exists. Then f ′ ( a ) {\displaystyle f'(a)} also exists and f ′ ( a ) = lim x → → a f ′ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle f'(a)=\lim _{x\to a}f'(x).} In particular, f' is also continuous at a .

Thus, if a function is not continuously differentiable near a point, the derivative must have an essential discontinuity at that point.

Proof [ edit ] Consider the functions h ( x ) = f ( x ) − − f ( a ) {\displaystyle h(x)=f(x)-f(a)} and g ( x ) = x − − a {\displaystyle g(x)=x-a} . The continuity of f at a tells us that lim x → → a h ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a}h(x)=0} . Moreover, lim x → → a g ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a}g(x)=0} since a polynomial function is always continuous everywhere. Applying L'Hopital's rule shows that f ′ ( a ) := lim x → → a f ( x ) − − f ( a ) x − − a = lim x → → a h ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) = lim x → → a f ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle f'(a):=\lim _{x\to a}{\frac {f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}}=\lim _{x\to a}{\frac {h'(x)}{g'(x)}}=\lim _{x\to a}f'(x)} .

Since then, French spellings have changed : the silent 's' has been removed and replaced with a circumflex over the preceding vowel.

^ "Proposition I.  Problême.  Soit une ligne courbe AMD (AP = x, PM = y, AB = a [see Figure 130] ) telle que la valeur de l'appliquée y soit exprimée par une fraction, dont le numérateur & le dénominateur deviennent chacun zero lorsque x = a, c'est à dire lorsque le point P tombe sur le point donné B.  On demande quelle doit être alors la valeur de l'appliquée BD.  [Solution: ]...si l'on prend la difference du numérateur, & qu'on la divise par la difference du denominateur, apres avoir fait x = a = Ab ou AB, l'on aura la valeur cherchée de l'appliquée bd ou BD." Translation :  "Let there be a curve AMD (where AP = X, PM = y, AB = a) such that the value of the ordinate y is expressed by a fraction whose numerator and denominator each become zero when x = a; that is, when the point P falls on the given point B.  One asks what shall then be the value of the ordinate BD.  [Solution: ]... if one takes the differential of the numerator and if one divides it by the differential of the denominator, after having set x = a = Ab or AB, one will have the value [that was] sought of the ordinate bd or BD." [ 2 ] ^ The functional analysis definition of the limit of a function does not require the existence of such an interval.

^ Since g' is nonzero and g is continuous on the interval, it is impossible for g to be zero more than once on the interval. If it had two zeros, the mean value theorem would assert the existence of a point p in the interval between the zeros such that g' ( p ) = 0. So either g is already nonzero on the interval, or else the interval can be reduced in size so as not to contain the single zero of g .

^ The limits lim x → → c m ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}m(x)} and lim x → → c M ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}M(x)} both exist as they feature nondecreasing and nonincreasing functions of x , respectively.

Consider a sequence x i → → c {\displaystyle x_{i}\to c} . Then lim i m ( x i ) ≤ ≤ lim i f ′ ( x i ) g ′ ( x i ) ≤ ≤ lim i M ( x i ) {\displaystyle \lim _{i}m(x_{i})\leq \lim _{i}{\frac {f'(x_{i})}{g'(x_{i})}}\leq \lim _{i}M(x_{i})} , as the inequality holds for each i ; this yields the inequalities lim x → → c m ( x ) ≤ ≤ lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) ≤ ≤ lim x → → c M ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}m(x)\leq \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}\leq \lim _{x\to c}M(x)} The next step is to show lim x → → c M ( x ) ≤ ≤ lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}M(x)\leq \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}} . Fix a sequence of numbers ε ε i > 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{i}>0} such that lim i ε ε i = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{i}\varepsilon _{i}=0} , and a sequence x i → → c {\displaystyle x_{i}\to c} . For each i , choose x i < y i < c {\displaystyle x_{i}<y_{i}<c} such that f ′ ( y i ) g ′ ( y i ) + ε ε i ≥ ≥ sup x i < ξ ξ < c f ′ ( ξ ξ ) g ′ ( ξ ξ ) {\displaystyle {\frac {f'(y_{i})}{g'(y_{i})}}+\varepsilon _{i}\geq \sup _{x_{i}<\xi <c}{\frac {f'(\xi )}{g'(\xi )}}} , by the definition of sup {\displaystyle \sup } . Thus lim i M ( x i ) ≤ ≤ lim i f ′ ( y i ) g ′ ( y i ) + ε ε i = lim i f ′ ( y i ) g ′ ( y i ) + lim i ε ε i = lim i f ′ ( y i ) g ′ ( y i ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lim _{i}M(x_{i})&\leq \lim _{i}{\frac {f'(y_{i})}{g'(y_{i})}}+\varepsilon _{i}\\&=\lim _{i}{\frac {f'(y_{i})}{g'(y_{i})}}+\lim _{i}\varepsilon _{i}\\&=\lim _{i}{\frac {f'(y_{i})}{g'(y_{i})}}\end{aligned}}} as desired.

The argument that lim x → → c m ( x ) ≥ ≥ lim x → → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}m(x)\geq \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}} is similar.
