Many virtual zoos are websites that are created to simulate a visit to a zoo, and the visitors to these sites can view exhibits about animals and their habitats.  Many zoos [ 2 ] as well as schools [ 3 ] have developed virtual zoos offering educational articles and media as exhibits.

History [ edit ] The first virtual zoo was created in 1994 by Ken Boschert, DVM.
