At a time when very few women were successful artists, she had a thriving career. Hyatt Huntington exhibited often, traveled widely, received critical acclaim at home and abroad, and won multiple awards and commissions.

During the first two decades of the 20th century, Hyatt Huntington became famous for her animal sculptures, which combine vivid emotional depth with skillful realism. In 1915, she created the first public monument by a woman to be erected in New York City . Her Joan of Arc , located on Riverside Drive at 93rd Street, is the city's first monument dedicated to a historical woman.

[ 2 ] Biography [ edit ] Anna Vaughn Hyatt was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts , on March 10, 1876. She was the daughter of the artist Audella Beebe and Alpheus Hyatt , a professor of paleontology and zoology at Harvard University and MIT . Her father encouraged her early interest in animals and animal anatomy. Anna Hyatt first studied with Henry Hudson Kitson in Boston , who threw her out after she identified equine anatomical deficiencies in his work (Rubenstein 1990).

[ 2 ] She spent two years collaborating with Abastenia St. Leger Eberle to produce Man and Bull , which was exhibited at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904.

The Hispanic Society of America was founded in 1904 by her husband, Archie Huntington. Hyatt Huntington created the sculptures and fittings in its courtyard, [ 11 ] including: bronze statue, El Cid (1927) There are also editions of this sculpture in: Seville and Valencia, Spain ; Lincoln Park , San Francisco ; Balboa Park , San Diego ( El Cid Campeador ); and Buenos Aires, Argentina four bronze Castilian warriors arranged around the El Cid statue, bronze flagpole bases, limestone bas-relief of Don Quixote , the hero of the novel by Cervantes; and limestone bas-relief of Boabdil , the last Moorish king of Spain.

She created two statues that are located at the entrance to Collis P. Huntington State Park in Redding and Bethel, Connecticut : Mother Bear and Cubs and Sculpture of Wolves . The park was donated to the state of Connecticut by the Huntingtons. Other equestrian statues by Huntington greet visitors to the entrance to Redding Elementary School, the John Read Middle School, and at the Mark Twain Library. The statue at the elementary school is called Fighting Stallions and the one at the middle school is called A Tribute to the Workhorse . The sculpture at the Mark Twain Library, also called The Torch Bearers , is identical in form to the one in Madrid, but is cast in bronze and appears to be smaller.

[ 16 ] Andrew Jackson, A Boy of The Waxhaws , Andrew Jackson State Park , Lancaster, South Carolina , depicts a young Andy Jackson, sitting astride a farm horse. It is a bronze, larger-than-life statue. Usually her horses were noble, prancing, fierce beasts. She made Jackson's horse a gentler animal by fixing the energy and tension of the work on the figure of young Jackson. The sculpture was initiated by a letter from a sixth-grade class at Rice Elementary School in Lancaster, South Carolina , asking Mrs. Huntington if she would sculpt a statue of young Andrew Jackson for the state park. Mrs. Huntington submitted to do so, and replied, in part, "A picture came to mind as I read your letter and I have tried out the composition. I have Jackson as a young man of sixteen or seventeen seated bareback on a farm horse, one hand leaning on the horse's rump and looking over his native hills, to wonder what the future holds for him. He must have been a good looking and thoughtful boy, wondering what the future might hold, moments we all have from our teens to our nineties." The statue was completed at her Bethel, Connecticut studio, and was first worked in clay in half the scale of the final statue. Even then, it was necessary for the octogenarian sculptor to use a tall ladder to reach the top. South Carolina school children responded by donating their nickels and dimes to raise the necessary funds for a massive base to support the statue, which looks out over the large expanse of lawn at the park. County workmen placed the statue on its Lancaster County pink granite base in time for the ceremony marking Andrew Jackson's 200th birthday, in March 1967. This was Huntington's last major work, completed after her ninety-first birthday. The statue is located at Andrew Jackson State Park , about nine miles (14 km) north of Lancaster, South Carolina , just off US 521.

General Israel Putnam , Putnam Memorial Park , Redding, Connecticut , commemorates General Putnam's escape from the British in 1779, when he rode down a cliff at Horseneck Heights in Greenwich, Connecticut .
