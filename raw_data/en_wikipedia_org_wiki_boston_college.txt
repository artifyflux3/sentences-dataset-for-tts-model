Founded in 1863 by the Society of Jesus , a Catholic religious order , the university has more than 15,000 total students.

[ 7 ] Boston College was originally located in the South End of Boston before moving most of its campus to Chestnut Hill in 1907. Its main campus is a historic district and features some of the earliest examples of collegiate gothic architecture in North America . The campus is 6 miles west of downtown Boston . It offers bachelor's degrees , master's degrees , and doctoral degrees through its nine colleges and schools. Boston College is classified as a "Research 1: Very High Research Spending and Doctorate Production" university by the Carnegie Classification .

[ 8 ] Boston College athletic teams are the Eagles . Their colors are maroon and gold and their mascot is Baldwin the Eagle . The Eagles compete in NCAA Division I as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference in all sports offered by the ACC. The men's and women's ice hockey teams compete in Hockey East .

Boston College's men's ice hockey team has won five national championships.

[ 9 ] Alumni and affiliates of the university include governors, ambassadors, members of Congress, scholars, writers, medical researchers, Hollywood actors, and professional athletes.

[ 10 ] Boston College alumni include three Rhodes , 22 Truman , and 171 Fulbright scholars.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] History [ edit ] Early BC in Boston's South End Further information: List of presidents of Boston College Early history [ edit ] Boston College was founded through the efforts of the first Jesuit community in New England , which was established at St. Mary's Church in Boston in 1849.

[ 15 ] Jesuit priest John McElroy maintained the vision for what became BC, recognizing the need for an educational institution for the Irish Catholic immigrant population.

[ 16 ] With the approval of his Jesuit superiors, McElroy raised funds and purchased land for "The Boston College" on Harrison Avenue in the Hudson neighborhood of South End, Boston, Massachusetts , in 1857.

[ 17 ] On April 1, 1863, the college was granted a university charter by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , allowing the board of trustees to confer degrees typically awarded by colleges in the state.

[ 15 ] John Bapst served as the first President of BC and launched the collegiate instruction program on September 5, 1864.

[ 15 ] The average age of students in its early years was fourteen, indicating a strong presence of high schoolers, which aligned with the Society of Jesus 's preparatory tradition from Europe.

[ 17 ] The student body consisted mainly of local boys from greater Boston parishes, some of whom received scholarships, while campus life focused heavily on religious activities, requiring Catholic students to attend Mass, partake in confession, and join devotional societies.

[ 17 ] The curriculum was based on the Jesuit Ratio Studiorum , emphasizing Latin , Greek , philosophy , and theology .

[ 18 ] Expansion of the South End buildings onto James Street enabled increased separation between the high school and college divisions, though Boston College High School remained a constituent part of Boston College until 1927, when it was separately incorporated .

[ 19 ] Move to Chestnut Hill [ edit ] In 1907, newly installed president Thomas I. Gasson determined that BC's cramped, urban quarters in Boston's South End were inadequate and unsuited for significant expansion. Inspired by John Winthrop 's early vision of Boston as a " city upon a hill ", he re-imagined Boston College as a beacon of Jesuit scholarship. Less than a year after taking office, he purchased Amos Adams Lawrence 's farm on Chestnut Hill , six miles (10 km) west of downtown. He organized an international competition for the design of a campus master plan and set about raising funds for the construction of the "new" university. Construction began in 1909.

[ 20 ] By 1913, construction costs had surpassed available funds, and, as a result, Gasson Hall , "New BC's" main building, stood alone on Chestnut Hill for its first three years. While Maginnis's ambitious plans were never fully realized, BC's first "capital campaign"—which included a large replica of Gasson Hall's clock tower set up on Boston Common to measure the fundraising progress—ensured that President Gasson's vision survived.

Academic expansion and co-education [ edit ] By the 1920s, BC began to fill out the dimensions of its university charter, establishing the Boston College Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, the Boston College Law School , and the Woods College of Advancing Studies , followed successively by the Boston College Graduate School of Social Work , the Carroll School of Management , the Connell School of Nursing , and the Lynch School of Education and Human Development . In 1926, Boston College conferred its first degrees on women (though it did not become fully coeducational until 1970). On April 20, 1963, an address by President John F. Kennedy , the nation's first Catholic president who had received an honorary degree in 1956, was the highlight of a week-long centennial celebration.

[ 21 ] Gasson Hall in spring Gasson Hall in summer Gasson Hall in autumn Gasson Hall in winter Monan's presidency and institutional expansion [ edit ] When J. Donald Monan began his presidency on September 5, 1972, Boston College faced significant financial challenges, including a $30 million debt and a frozen salary structure for faculty and staff.

[ 22 ] During his tenure, the Boston College Board of Trustees was restructured to include lay alumni and business leaders, moving away from its traditional composition of Society of Jesus members. In 1973, Monan appointed Frank B. Campanella as BC’s first executive vice president, focusing on fiscal matters and university administration.

[ 22 ] Campanella held this position until 1991. In 1974, BC adopted depreciation accounting, a novel approach at the time for universities, reflecting a more sophisticated financial strategy.

[ 22 ] BC merged with Newton College of the Sacred Heart in that same year, acquiring its 40-acre campus just 1.5 miles away, which allowed the Boston College Law School to relocate and provided much-needed housing for an increasingly residential student body.

In April 1976, BC launched a capital campaign with a goal of raising $21 million but ultimately secured $25 million.

[ 22 ] By 1982, the university had enjoyed a decade of financial stability, with an endowment of $36 million by the end of the 1981–82 academic year. Following an aggressive capital campaign in 1989 that raised $136 million, the endowment reached $250 million, surpassed $350 million in 1992, and exceeded $500 million by 1995. When Monan transitioned to University Chancellor in 1996, the endowment had grown to $590 million.

[ 22 ] Continued growth and development [ edit ] Gasson Quadrangle Under the presidency of William P. Leahy , which began after Monan's tenure, Boston College experienced significant growth and development. In 2002, Leahy initiated the Church in the 21st Century program, addressing issues facing the Catholic Church in light of the clergy sexual abuse scandal , which positioned BC as a leader in advocating for Church reform.

[ 23 ] Plans to merge with the Weston Jesuit School of Theology furthered the university's ambition to be a leading intellectual center for Catholic theology in the United States.

[ 24 ] Campus Green Stokes Hall amphitheater In 2007, BC announced a $1.6 billion master plan for campus revitalization over ten years, aiming to enhance facilities and hire new faculty. While the plan received mixed reactions from city officials, it marked a significant step toward expanding the university's capabilities. By June 10, 2009, the Boston College Master Plan was approved by city authorities, allowing the university to enter the design and planning phases for its ambitious development projects. Through these initiatives, Boston College has continued to adapt and evolve as a prominent institution in higher education.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] Campuses [ edit ] The Boston College campus is known generally as the "Heights" and to some as the "Crowned Hilltop" due largely to its location and presence of buildings featuring gothic towers reaching into the sky.

[ 27 ] The main campus is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

[ 28 ] The University also encompasses the Connors Family Retreat and Conference Center in Dover, Massachusetts , the Weston Observatory in Weston, Massachusetts , and various other properties in the region.

Chestnut Hill campus [ edit ] Main article: Boston College Main Campus Historic District Aerial view of the Chestnut Hill main campus.

Boston College's main campus, located in Chestnut Hill, 6 miles (9.7 km) west of downtown Boston, is 175 acres and features over 120 buildings set atop a hill overlooking the Chestnut Hill Reservoir .

The campus is accessible via the Boston College station , situated at St. Ignatius Gate. This station serves as the western terminus of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Green Line 's B branch (also known as the "Boston College" line), connecting the university to downtown Boston and other destinations.

Other properties [ edit ] In 2017, Boston College acquired the 24-acre Mishkan Tefila Synagogue property in Chestnut Hill, which was previously used for administrative services and event parking. The synagogue's 806-seat auditorium has since been transformed into the university's largest theater venue for the Robsham Theater Arts Center, alongside a ballroom-style multi-purpose room and a hexagon-shaped meeting room for various events. An outdoor quad is also available for performances and gatherings.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] In 2019, the City of Newton took approximately 17 wooded acres of the property through eminent domain.

[ 31 ] In 2020, Boston College further expanded its mission by acquiring Pine Manor College , a financially struggling liberal arts institution in Chestnut Hill that served a significant number of first-generation and inner-city students.

[ 32 ] Newton Campus [ edit ] In 1975, Boston College merged with Newton College of the Sacred Heart . The Centre Street campus of the Newton College has since become housing for freshman of Boston College and the current location of the Boston College Law School .

[ 33 ] Athletic fields for some of Boston College's teams have also been constructed on Newton Campus. The campus is located 1 mile west of the main campus and is serviced by the university bus system.

[ 34 ] Brighton Campus [ edit ] Between 2004 and 2007, Boston College acquired 65 acres (260,000 m 2 ) of land from the Archdiocese of Boston .

[ 3 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] This included the archdiocese's former headquarters, sold to the university in 2004 for $107,400,000.

[ 37 ] This land holds a variety of buildings for the school of theology, along with facilities for the men's baseball and women's softball team.

[ 38 ] Brookline Campus [ edit ] The Brookline campus is home to Messina College (formerly Pine Manor College), which includes several residence halls and other academic and athletic facilities. Messina College opened in July 2024 for over 100 first-generation college students. It offers associate degrees in applied data science, health sciences, general business, and applied psychology and human development. The college emphasizes support for underprivileged students through a residential model, small class sizes, and mentorship, preparing graduates for workforce entry or transfer to four-year institutions.

[ 39 ] Organization and administration [ edit ] Its annual operating budget is approximately $1.02 billion.

[ 40 ] The most recent and ongoing fundraising campaign, dubbed "Soaring Higher", was announced on September 28, 2023. The campaign aims to raise $3 billion, double the last campaign's goal. Of this goal, $1.1 billion is earmarked for student financial aid, $750 million is for student life initiatives, and $1.15 billion is for academic programs.

[ 41 ] Catholic and Jesuit [ edit ] St. Ignatius of Loyola statue by Bolivian-born artist Pablo Eduardo .

As of 2005, there were 112 Jesuits living on the Boston College campus, including members of the faculty and administration, graduate students, and visiting international scholars.

[ 42 ] The chapel for the university is located in St. Mary's Hall, the Jesuit residential facility. Additional BC chapels are Trinity Chapel on the Newton Campus, St. Joseph's Chapel in the Basement of Gonzaga Hall on Upper Campus, Simboli Hall Chapel on the Brighton Campus, and St. Catherine of Sienna Chapel in Cushing Hall.

[ 43 ] Over 70 Catholic Masses are celebrated on Campus each week during the Academic Year. The college also maintains close relations with the nearby Church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola.

[ 44 ] Affiliated institutions [ edit ] St. Columbkille Parish is a Catholic Church and elementary school in Brighton , Massachusetts , that has an alliance with BC. Under the agreement, the parish school is to be governed by a board of members and a board of trustees comprising representatives from the Archdiocese of Boston , Boston College, St. Columbkille Parish and the greater Boston community.

O'Neill Library [ edit ] Before the Thomas P. O’Neill, Jr.

Library opened in 1984, Bapst Library had served as BC’s main research facility since 1925. During Monan's tenure, the university transformed from a small college into a national institution. Monan played a key role in planning O’Neill Library to meet the needs of this transformation.

[ 82 ] In a 1992 interview, Monan expressed pride in the library's impact, noting how it was often filled with students studying and contributing to the overall learning experience for both students and faculty.

[ 86 ] [ 87 ] The term was coined at Boston College in 1979 by two students, Alfred Feliciano and Valerie Lewis, [ 88 ] who objected to the name "Office of Minority Programs" used by Boston College at the time. They cited the definition of the word minority as "less than" and proposed, instead, to use the term AHANA which they felt celebrated social cultural differences. After receiving overwhelming approval from the university's board of trustees , and UGBC president Dan Cotter, the Office of Minority Student Programs became the Office of AHANA Student Programs. The term, or one or its derivative forms, such as ALANA (where " Latino " is substituted for "Hispanic"), has become common on a number of other American university campuses. Boston College, which has registered the term AHANA as a trademark , has granted official permission for its use to over 50 institutions and organizations in the United States . Many more use the term unofficially. Other institutions that use the AHANA acronym include Suffolk University , [ 89 ] Cleveland State University , [ 90 ] Eastern Mennonite University , [ 91 ] Saint Martin's University , [ 92 ] Le Moyne College , [ 93 ] and Salem State University .

BC participates in the annual Beanpot tournaments held at TD Garden , competing against the Northeastern University Huskies , Harvard University Crimson, and Boston University Terriers .

Football [ edit ] Main article: Boston College Eagles football See also: Flutie effect and Holy War (Boston College–Notre Dame) Boston College's first football team in 1893.

The Boston College Eagles football team represents Boston College in American football and competes in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Home games are played at Alumni Stadium, located on the university's campus in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. The team is currently coached by Bill O'Brien , who has previously served as head coach at Penn State and as an offensive coordinator at Alabama and the NFL's New England Patriots.

Founded in 1892, the Eagles have a rich history, winning four Eastern championships in 1940, 1942, 1983, and 1984, as well as a co-Big East championship in 2004. The program claims a national championship in 1940, although this title is not recognized by the NCAA.

With over 690 wins and a postseason bowl game record of 15–13, the team has participated in notable bowls such as the 1941 Sugar Bowl and the 1985 Cotton Bowl. The Eagles have produced a Heisman Trophy winner , Doug Flutie , along with 13 consensus All-Americans and over 200 NFL players. Additionally, eight members of the program have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame , while Art Donovan and Ernie Stautner have earned spots in the Pro Football Hall of Fame .

Women's lacrosse [ edit ] Main article: Boston College Eagles women's lacrosse The Boston College Eagles women's lacrosse team is an NCAA Division I college lacrosse team representing Boston College as part of the Atlantic Coast Conference . They play their home games at Newton Soccer Complex in Newton, Massachusetts , and occasionally, at Alumni Stadium in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts .

Protests and controversy [ edit ] 1970 protest [ edit ] In 1970, BC faced student unrest due to a proposed $500 tuition increase amid a financial crisis, prompting protests and a strike led by students and supported by Professor Harold Petersen. As tensions escalated, students voiced concerns over rising costs and a lack of administrative transparency, ultimately leading to a broader anti-war movement following the Kent State shootings . This period was marked by significant campus activism, with BC students pushing for changes that culminated in the severing of ties with ROTC in the fall of 1970.

[ 125 ] Protests against racism [ edit ] On October 18, 2017, hundreds of students walked out of class in a protest against racism and to demand the college officials pay more attention to the school's racial climate. The walk out was sparked by the defacing of two Black Lives Matter posters and an offensive photo was circulated on social media sites.

[ 126 ] On December 8, 2018, walls, furniture, and a bathroom in the Welch Hall were vandalized with racist, anti-black graffiti.

[ 95 ] Also, over the previous months, pro-refugee and Black Lives Matter signs were repeatedly removed around campus.

[ 127 ] LGBT [ edit ] In 2003, after years of student-led discussions and efforts, and administrators' repeated rejection of pleas from students, the school approved a Gay-Straight Alliance, the first university-funded gay support group on campus. In 2004, between 1,000 and 1,200 students rallied behind a student-led campaign to expand the school's non-discrimination statement to include equal protection for gays and lesbians.

[ 128 ] Earlier that year 84% of the student body voted in favor of a student referendum calling for a change in policy.

[ 129 ] After several months of discussion the university changed its statement of nondiscrimination to make it more welcoming to gay students in May 2005, but stopped short of prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

[ 130 ] Notable persons [ edit ] Main article: List of Boston College people BC students were universally called "Heightsmen" until 1925 when Caitlin Beckman became the first "Heightswoman" to receive a BC degree. "Heightsonian" was originally conceived as a way to gender neutralize the original term "Heightsmen", though "Eagles", once exclusively used for members of the university's athletics teams, is more commonly used.

[ 42 ] The term "Golden Eagles" refers strictly to BC graduates who have celebrated their 50th anniversary reunion. "Double Eagles" refer to alumni received an undergraduate and graduate degree from the college and "Triple Eagles" are those alumni who are also attended Boston College High School .

There are over 179,000 alumni in over 120 countries around the world.

[ 3 ] Boston College students have been recipients of Rhodes , Marshall , Mellon , Fulbright , Truman , Churchill , and Goldwater scholarships . Boston College alumni include 3 Rhodes , 22 Truman, and 171 Fulbright scholars.
