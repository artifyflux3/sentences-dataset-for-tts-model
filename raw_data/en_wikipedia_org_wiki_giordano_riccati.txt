Giordano Riccati or Jordan Riccati (25 February, 1709 – 20 July, 1790) was an Italian mathematician and physicist . The son of the mathematician Jacopo Riccati , he was the first experimental physicist to study material elastic moduli.

Biography [ edit ] Giordano Riccati was born in 1709 in Castelfranco Veneto , a small town about 30 km north of Padua . He was the brother of Vincenzo Riccati and the fifth son of the theoretical mechanician Jacopo Riccati .

[ 1 ] He began his studies at the College of St. Francis Xavier in Bologna, under the guidance of Francesco Saverio Quadrio and Luigi Marchenti, a pupil of the French mathematician Pierre Varignon .

[ 2 ] In 1727, he returned to Castelfranco, where his father taught him geometry , trigonometry , calculus , statics and dynamics . He then moved to the University of Padua and attended Giovanni Poleni 's lessons on hydraulics as well as the lectures of the famous physician and naturalist Antonio Vallisneri .

[ 2 ] A polymath with a vast range of interests, Riccati published treatises on mathematics, architecture , acoustics , music theory , history and metaphysics . He made significant contributions in the field of physics and mathematics applied to music , publishing the Saggio sulle leggi del contrappunto [Essay on the laws of counterpoint], which tried to prove that music is not just an art, but it is a science as well, a Trattato delle corde, ovvero delle Fibre Elastiche [Treaty on chords; on elastic fibers], and some studies on the works of Tartini and Rameau . Giordano helped with the improvements to the Cathedral of Treviso . He died in Treviso on July 20, 1790 and was buried in his family chapel in the Cathedral of Treviso.

Riccati was a member of the Accademia Galileiana of Padua, of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna and of the Italian National Academy of Sciences . Riccati corresponded regularly with the finest scholars of the period and cultivated a circle of friends with similar interests – intellectuals, artists, and writers who often gathered at his house. He enjoyed a close friendship with the architect Francesco Maria Preti , whose treatise Elementi di architettura he edited after Preti's death.

[ 3 ] Contributions [ edit ] Riccati was the first experimental mechanician to study material elastic moduli as we understand them today. His 1782 paper [ 4 ] on determining the relative Young's moduli of steel and brass using flexural vibrations preceded Thomas Young's 1807 paper on the subject of moduli.

[ 5 ] The ratio that Riccati found was: [ 6 ] E steel E brass = 2.06 {\displaystyle {\frac {E_{\mbox{steel}}}{E_{\mbox{brass}}}}=2.06} Even though the experiments were performed more than 200 years ago, this value is remarkably close to accepted values found in engineering handbooks in 2007.
