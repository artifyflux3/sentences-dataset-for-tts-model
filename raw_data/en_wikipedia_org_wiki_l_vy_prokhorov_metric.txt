It is named after the French mathematician Paul Lévy and the Soviet mathematician Yuri Vasilyevich Prokhorov ; Prokhorov introduced it in 1956 as a generalization of the earlier Lévy metric .

Definition [ edit ] Let ( M , d ) {\displaystyle (M,d)} be a metric space with its Borel sigma algebra B ( M ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}(M)} . Let P ( M ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(M)} denote the collection of all probability measures on the measurable space ( M , B ( M ) ) {\displaystyle (M,{\mathcal {B}}(M))} .

For a subset A ⊆ ⊆ M {\displaystyle A\subseteq M} , define the ε-neighborhood of A {\displaystyle A} by A ε ε := { p ∈ ∈ M | ∃ ∃ q ∈ ∈ A , d ( p , q ) < ε ε } = ⋃ ⋃ p ∈ ∈ A B ε ε ( p ) .

{\displaystyle A^{\varepsilon }:=\{p\in M~|~\exists q\in A,\ d(p,q)<\varepsilon \}=\bigcup _{p\in A}B_{\varepsilon }(p).} where B ε ε ( p ) {\displaystyle B_{\varepsilon }(p)} is the open ball of radius ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } centered at p {\displaystyle p} .

The Lévy–Prokhorov metric π π : P ( M ) 2 → → [ 0 , + ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle \pi :{\mathcal {P}}(M)^{2}\to [0,+\infty )} is defined by setting the distance between two probability measures μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } and ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } to be π π ( μ μ , ν ν ) := inf { ε ε > 0 | μ μ ( A ) ≤ ≤ ν ν ( A ε ε ) + ε ε and ν ν ( A ) ≤ ≤ μ μ ( A ε ε ) + ε ε for all A ∈ ∈ B ( M ) } .

{\displaystyle \pi (\mu ,\nu ):=\inf \left\{\varepsilon >0~|~\mu (A)\leq \nu (A^{\varepsilon })+\varepsilon \ {\text{and}}\ \nu (A)\leq \mu (A^{\varepsilon })+\varepsilon \ {\text{for all}}\ A\in {\mathcal {B}}(M)\right\}.} For probability measures clearly π π ( μ μ , ν ν ) ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle \pi (\mu ,\nu )\leq 1} .

Some authors omit one of the two inequalities or choose only open or closed A {\displaystyle A} ; either inequality implies the other, and ( A ¯ ¯ ) ε ε = A ε ε {\displaystyle ({\bar {A}})^{\varepsilon }=A^{\varepsilon }} , but restricting to open sets may change the metric so defined (if M {\displaystyle M} is not Polish ).

Properties [ edit ] If ( M , d ) {\displaystyle (M,d)} is separable , convergence of measures in the Lévy–Prokhorov metric is equivalent to weak convergence of measures . Thus, π π {\displaystyle \pi } is a metrization of the topology of weak convergence on P ( M ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(M)} .

The metric space ( P ( M ) , π π ) {\displaystyle \left({\mathcal {P}}(M),\pi \right)} is separable if and only if ( M , d ) {\displaystyle (M,d)} is separable.

If ( P ( M ) , π π ) {\displaystyle \left({\mathcal {P}}(M),\pi \right)} is complete then ( M , d ) {\displaystyle (M,d)} is complete. If all the measures in P ( M ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(M)} have separable support , then the converse implication also holds: if ( M , d ) {\displaystyle (M,d)} is complete then ( P ( M ) , π π ) {\displaystyle \left({\mathcal {P}}(M),\pi \right)} is complete. In particular, this is the case if ( M , d ) {\displaystyle (M,d)} is separable.

If ( M , d ) {\displaystyle (M,d)} is separable and complete, a subset K ⊆ ⊆ P ( M ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}(M)} is relatively compact if and only if its π π {\displaystyle \pi } -closure is π π {\displaystyle \pi } -compact.

If ( M , d ) {\displaystyle (M,d)} is separable , then π π ( μ μ , ν ν ) = inf { α α ( X , Y ) : Law ( X ) = μ μ , Law ( Y ) = ν ν } {\displaystyle \pi (\mu ,\nu )=\inf\{\alpha (X,Y):{\text{Law}}(X)=\mu ,{\text{Law}}(Y)=\nu \}} , where α α ( X , Y ) = inf { ε ε > 0 : P ( d ( X , Y ) > ε ε ) ≤ ≤ ε ε } {\displaystyle \alpha (X,Y)=\inf\{\varepsilon >0:\mathbb {P} (d(X,Y)>\varepsilon )\leq \varepsilon \}} is the Ky Fan metric .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Relation to other distances [ edit ] Let ( M , d ) {\displaystyle (M,d)} be separable. Then π π ( μ μ , ν ν ) ≤ ≤ δ δ ( μ μ , ν ν ) {\displaystyle \pi (\mu ,\nu )\leq \delta (\mu ,\nu )} , where δ δ ( μ μ , ν ν ) {\displaystyle \delta (\mu ,\nu )} is the total variation distance of probability measures [ 3 ] π π ( μ μ , ν ν ) 2 ≤ ≤ W p ( μ μ , ν ν ) p {\displaystyle \pi (\mu ,\nu )^{2}\leq W_{p}(\mu ,\nu )^{p}} , where W p {\displaystyle W_{p}} is the Wasserstein metric with p ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle p\geq 1} and μ μ , ν ν {\displaystyle \mu ,\nu } have finite p {\displaystyle p} th moment.
