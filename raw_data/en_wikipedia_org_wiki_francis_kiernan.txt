He was born in Ireland , the eldest of four children.

[ 1 ] His father, Francis Kiernan (died 7 March 1850 at 30 Manchester Square , London), was also a physician and brought the family to England in the early 19th century. Francis junior was educated at the Roman Catholic College at Ware, Hertfordshire , and was trained in medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital , London.

[ 2 ] He set up a private anatomy class in Charterhouse Square , but, in the words of the British Medical Journal , his "great success as a teacher caused much jealousy, and, in 1825, gave rise to the Council of the College of Surgeons passing a resolution refusing to receive certificates from any but recognised teachers." [ 1 ] Kiernan's class size dwindled as students departed. Appeals to the Council to rescind its decision, on the grounds of Kiernan's ability and skill as a teacher, were dismissed.

[ 1 ] He became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1825.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1834 [ 3 ] and was awarded its Copley Medal in 1836 for his work on the anatomy of the liver .

[ 4 ] That same year, he became a founding Member of the Senate of the University of London , where he acted as examiner and lecturer in anatomy and physiology .

In 1843, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and served on its Council from 1850. After a single year as Vice-President (1864–5), he declined re-nomination on the grounds of ill-health, [ 5 ] having suffered a paralytic stroke in 1865 from which he never fully recovered.

[ 2 ] In 1849, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society .

[ 6 ] He died unmarried at his home in Manchester Street, Manchester Square, London on New Year's Eve, 1874, [ 7 ] and was buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery at Mortlake , London.
