The theorem makes a fundamental statement about the dimension of the dual spaces of infinite-dimensional vector spaces ; in particular, it shows that the algebraic dual space is not isomorphic to the vector space itself. A more general formulation allows to compute the exact dimension of any function space .

The theorem is named after Paul Erdős and Irving Kaplansky .

Statement [ edit ] Let E {\displaystyle E} be an infinite-dimensional vector space over a field K {\displaystyle \mathbb {K} } and let I {\displaystyle I} be some basis of it. Then for the dual space E ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle E^{*}} , [ 1 ] dim ⁡ ⁡ ( E ∗ ∗ ) = card ⁡ ⁡ ( K I ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {dim} (E^{*})=\operatorname {card} (\mathbb {K} ^{I}).} By Cantor's theorem , this cardinal is strictly larger than the dimension card ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {card} (I)} of E {\displaystyle E} . More generally, if I {\displaystyle I} is an arbitrary infinite set, the dimension of the space of all functions K I {\displaystyle \mathbb {K} ^{I}} is given by: [ 2 ] dim ⁡ ⁡ ( K I ) = card ⁡ ⁡ ( K I ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {dim} (\mathbb {K} ^{I})=\operatorname {card} (\mathbb {K} ^{I}).} When I {\displaystyle I} is finite, it's a standard result that dim ⁡ ⁡ ( K I ) = card ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) {\displaystyle \dim(\mathbb {K} ^{I})=\operatorname {card} (I)} . This gives us a full characterization of the dimension of this space.
