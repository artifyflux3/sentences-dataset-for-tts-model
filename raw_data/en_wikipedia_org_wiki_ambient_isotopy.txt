They are ambient-isotopic in R 4 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{4}} .

In the mathematical subject of topology , an ambient isotopy , also called an h-isotopy , is a kind of continuous distortion of an ambient space , for example a manifold , taking a submanifold to another submanifold. For example in knot theory , one considers two knots the same if one can distort one knot into the other without breaking it. Such a distortion is an example of an ambient isotopy.

More precisely, let N {\displaystyle N} and M {\displaystyle M} be manifolds and g {\displaystyle g} and h {\displaystyle h} be embeddings of N {\displaystyle N} in M {\displaystyle M} .  A continuous map F : M × × [ 0 , 1 ] → → M {\displaystyle F:M\times [0,1]\rightarrow M} is defined to be an ambient isotopy taking g {\displaystyle g} to h {\displaystyle h} if
each F t : M → → M , F t ( .

) = F ( .

, t ) {\displaystyle F_{t}:M\rightarrow M,F_{t}(.)=F(.,t)} is a homeomorphism from M {\displaystyle M} to itself, F 0 {\displaystyle F_{0}} is the identity map and F 1 ∘ ∘ g = h {\displaystyle F_{1}\circ g=h} . This implies that the orientation must be preserved by ambient isotopies. For example, two knots that are mirror images of each other are, in general, not equivalent.
