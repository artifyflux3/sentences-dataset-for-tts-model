Founded as the private Ashmun Institute in 1854, it has been a public institution since 1972. Lincoln is also recognized as the first college-degree granting HBCU in the country.

[ 5 ] Its main campus is located on 422 acres (170.8 ha) near the town of Oxford in southern Chester County, Pennsylvania . The university has a second location in the University City area of Philadelphia . Lincoln University provides undergraduate and graduate coursework to approximately 2,000 students. It is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund .

While a majority of its students are African Americans , the university has a long history of accepting students of other races and nationalities.

[ 6 ] Women have received degrees since 1953, [ 6 ] and made up 66% of undergraduate enrollment in 2019.

[ 7 ] History [ edit ] In 1854, John Miller Dickey , a Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Sarah Emlen Cresson, a Quaker , founded Ashmun Institute, later named Lincoln University, in Hinsonville, Pennsylvania . They named it after Jehudi Ashmun , a religious leader and social reformer. They founded the school for the education of African Americans, who had few opportunities for higher education.

Presidents John Miller Dickey [ a ] 1854–1856 John Pym Carter 1856–1861 John Wynne Martin 1861–1865 Isaac Norton Rendall 1865–1906 John Ballard Rendall 1906–1924 Walter Livingston Wright * 1924–1926 William Hallock Johnson 1926–1936 Walter Livingston Wright 1936–1945 Horace Mann Bond [ b ] 1945–1957 Armstead Otey Grubb * 1957–1960 Donald Charles Yelton* 1960–1961 Marvin Wachman 1961–1969 Bernard Warren Harleston * 1970-1970 Herman Russell Branson 1970–1985 Donald Leopold Mullett * 1985–1987 Niara Sudarkasa 1987–1998 James A. Donaldson * 1998–1999 Ivory V. Nelson 1999–2011 Robert R. Jennings 2011–2014 Valerie I. Harrison* 2014–2015 Richard Green** 2015–2017 Brenda A. Allen 2017– * Acting president ** Interim president John Miller Dickey was the first president of the college. He encouraged some of his first students, James Ralston Amos (1826–1864), his brother Thomas Henry Amos (1825–1869), and Armistead Hutchinson Miller (1829/30-1865), to support the establishment of Liberia as a colony for African Americans. Each of the men became an ordained minister .

[ 8 ] In 1866, a year after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln , Ashmun Institute was renamed Lincoln University. The college attracted highly talented students from numerous states, especially during the decades of legal segregation in the American South . Many alumni furthered their careers in academia, public service, and the arts. President William Howard Taft gave the commencement address at Lincoln in 1910.

[ 9 ] In June 1921, days after the Tulsa race massacre , President Warren Harding visited Lincoln to deliver the commencement address. He spoke about the need to seek healing and harmony in that incident's aftermath, as well as to honor Lincoln alumni who were among the 367,000 African-American servicemen who fought in World War I . The school newspaper noted Harding's visit as "the high water mark in the history of the institution." [ 10 ] In 1945 Horace Mann Bond , an alumnus of Lincoln, became the first African-American president of the university. He served for twelve years.

[ 11 ] In 1946, in spite of then prevailing racial dynamics, Albert Einstein visited the university to give a lecture on Physics and also spoke on racism.

[ 12 ] This was depicted in a 2017 episode of Genius (American TV  series) , which dramatizes Einstein's life.

From 1854 to 1954, Lincoln University graduates accounted for 20% of African American physicians and over 10% of African American lawyers in the United States.

[ 13 ] The university marked its hundredth anniversary by amending its charter in 1953 to permit the granting of degrees to women. True coeducation was slow to arrive, however, and women still constituted only 5% of the student body in 1964.

[ 14 ] In 1972 Lincoln University formally associated with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a state-related institution.

In November 2014, university president Robert R. Jennings resigned under pressure from faculty, students and alumni after comments relating to issues of sexual assault.

[ 15 ] Jennings was also the subject of a couple of no-confidence votes by faculty and the alumni association in October 2014.

[ 16 ] In 2017, Brenda A. Allen became Lincoln's new president. She graduated from Lincoln in 1981.

[ 17 ] In 2020, MacKenzie Scott donated $20 million to Lincoln University. Her donation is the largest single gift in Lincoln's history.

[ 18 ] Academics [ edit ] According to U.S. News & World Report , Lincoln University ranks number 19 in the 2020 magazine's ranking of HBCUs.

[ 19 ] In 2020 the US News & World Best Colleges Report rated Lincoln 119 among Regional Universities North.

[ 20 ] Lincoln University's International and Study Abroad Program had student participation in Service Learning Projects in the countries of Ecuador , Argentina , Spain , Ireland , Costa Rica , Japan , France , Cambodia , Zambia , Liberia , Ghana, Kenya , Russia , Australia , Thailand , the Czech Republic , Mexico , and South Africa The Lincoln-Barnes Visual Arts program is a collaboration between Lincoln University and the Barnes Foundation. It established a Visual Arts program that leads to a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and most recently, a Pan-Africana Studies major has been added to the list undergraduate majors available at the institution.

Campus [ edit ] ALMA MATER Dear Lincoln, Dear Lincoln, To thee we'll e'er be true.

The golden hours we spent beneath The dear old Orange and Blue, Will live for e'er in memory, As guiding stars through life; For thee, our Alma Mater dear, We will rise in our might.

For thee, our Alma Mater dear, We will rise in our might.

For we love ev'ry inch of thy sacred soil, Ev'ry tree on thy campus green; And for thee with our might We will ever toil That thou mightiest be supreme.

We'll raise thy standard to the sky, Midst glory and honor to fly.

And constant and true We will live for thee anew, Our dear old Orange and Blue.

Hail! Hail! Lincoln.

— A. Dennee Bibb, 1911 Brown Memorial Chapel Lincoln University main campus is 422 acres (170.8 ha) with 56 buildings totaling over one million gross square feet. There are fifteen residence halls that accommodate over 1,600 students. The residence halls range from small dorms such as Alumni Hall, built in 1870; and Amos Hall, built in 1902, to the new coed 400-bed apartment-style living (ASL) suites built in 2005. There are additional off-campus housing arrangements such as Thorn Flats, in Newark, Delaware.

[ 21 ] The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2022.

[ 22 ] The four-story, 150,000-square-foot (14,000 m 2 ) Ivory V. Nelson Science Center and General Classroom High Technology Building was completed in 2008. The 60,000-square-foot (5,600 m 2 ) International Cultural Center was completed in 2010.

The Health and Wellness Center is a 105,000 square feet (9,800 m 2 ) facility that opened in 2012. There is also a  football stadium on campus. One of the most visible landmarks on campus is the Alumni Memorial Arch, located at the entrance to the university. The arch was dedicated by President Warren G. Harding in 1921, to honor the Lincoln men who served in World War I .

The Langston Hughes Memorial Library (LHML): Vail Memorial Library served as the first physical library building on the Lincoln University campus. Its collection outgrew the building's capacity after notable 1929 alumnus and renowned poet, James Mercer Langston Hughes, bequeathed the contents of his personal library to the university upon his death in 1967. Construction of a larger building was underway in 1970. The new Langston Hughes Memorial Library (LHML) opened in 1972. Holdings include over 185,000 volumes as well as databases containing in excess of 30,000 journal titles, periodicals, eBooks, and media offerings.

[ citation needed ] The completely renovated Student Union Building contains the bookstore, café, two television studios, and a radio studio, postal services, and multipurpose rooms. The Thurgood Marshall Living Learning Center, along with the Student Union Building, are the centers for campus social and meeting activities. Marshall graduated in the class of 1930, directed the NAACP 's Legal Defense Fund in groundbreaking cases, and was the first African American to be appointed as a justice to US Supreme Court .

The Student Union Building (SUB) Lincoln University is a census-designated place (CDP) for statistical purposes. As of the 2010 census , Lincoln University CDP had a resident population of 1,726.

Lincoln competes as a Division II member of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association and, the Eastern College Athletic Conference . Lincoln Lions compete in intercollegiate athletics in the following sports: baseball, soccer (women), basketball (men & women), volleyball (women), indoor track (men & women), outdoor track (men & women), cross-country (men & women), softball, and football.

The Barnes Foundation [ edit ] As president of Lincoln University (1945–1957), Horace Mann Bond formed a friendship with Albert C. Barnes , philanthropist and art collector who established the Barnes Foundation . Barnes took a special interest in the institution and built a relationship with its students. Barnes gave Lincoln University the privilege of naming four of the five directors originally set as the number for the governing board of the Barnes Foundation.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] Barnes had an interest in helping under-served youth and populations. Barnes intended his $25 billion art collection to be used primarily as a teaching resource. He limited the number of people who could view it, and for years even the kinds of people, with a preference for students and working class. Visitors still must make appointments in advance to see the collection, and only a limited number are allowed in the galleries at one time.

In the mid-20th century, local government restricted traffic to the current campus, located in a residential neighborhood located at 300 North Latch's Lane, Merion, Pennsylvania . Barnes' constraints, local factors, and management issues pushed the Foundation near bankruptcy by the 1990s. Supporters began to explore plans to move the collection to a more public location and maintain it to museum standards. To raise money for needed renovations to the main building to protect the collection, the Foundation sent some of the most famous Impressionist and Modern paintings on tour.

In 2002, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania D. Michael Fisher contested Albert C. Barnes' will , arguing that the Merion location of the collection and small number of board members limited the Foundation's ability to sustain itself financially.

Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell brokered a settlement in 2005 between the Barnes Foundation and Lincoln University. This agreement resulted in the number of directors increasing. This has diluted Lincoln's influence over the collection, now valued at approximately twenty-five billion dollars.

A documentary named The Art of the Steal depicts the events.
