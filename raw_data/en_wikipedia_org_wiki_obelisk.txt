[Lateran Obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateran_Obelisk "Lateran Obelisk") in [Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbasilica_of_Saint_John_Lateran "Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran"), [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome"). With its height of 32.18 metres (105.6 feet) (with the base and the cross it reaches 45.70 m) it is the largest standing ancient [monolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_column "Monolithic column") obelisk in the world.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-1)

An **obelisk** (; from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")[ὀβελίσκος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BD%80%CE%B2%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%AF%CF%83%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:ὀβελίσκος")_(\_obelískos\_)_,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-3)[diminutive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive") of [ὀβελός](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BD%80%CE%B2%CE%B5%CE%BB%CF%8C%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:ὀβελός") (_\_obelós\__) ' [spit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotisserie "Rotisserie"), nail, pointed pillar')[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-4) is a tall, slender, tapered [monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument "Monument") with four sides and a [pyramidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid "Pyramid") or [pyramidion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidion "Pyramidion") top.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-5) Originally constructed by [Ancient Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") and called [_tekhenu_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk_(hieroglyph) "Obelisk (hieroglyph)"), the [Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") used the Greek term _obeliskos_ to describe them, and this word passed into [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") and ultimately [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-6) Though William Thomas used the term correctly in his _Historie of Italie_ of 1549, by the late sixteenth century (after reduced contact with Italy following the excommunication of Queen Elizabeth), Shakespeare failed to distinguish between pyramids and obelisks in his plays and sonnets.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-7) Ancient obelisks are [monolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_column "Monolithic column") and consist of a single stone; most modern obelisks are made of several stones.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-8)

Obelisks were prominent in the architecture of the [ancient Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt"), and played a vital role in their religion placing them in pairs at the entrance of the [temples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_temple "Egyptian temple"). The word "obelisk" as used in English today is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because [Herodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus "Herodotus"), the Greek traveler, was one of the first classical writers to describe the objects. A number of ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the "[unfinished obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfinished_obelisk "Unfinished obelisk")" found partly hewn from its quarry at [Aswan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan "Aswan"). These obelisks are now dispersed around the world, and fewer than half of them remain in Egypt.

The earliest [temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple "Temple") obelisk still in its original position is the 68-foot (20.7 m) 120-[metric-ton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne "Tonne") (130-[short-ton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_ton "Short ton"))[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-9) red granite Obelisk of [Senusret I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senusret_I "Senusret I") of the [Twelfth Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Dynasty_of_Egypt "Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt") at [Al-Matariyyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Matareya,_Cairo "El Matareya, Cairo") in [modern Heliopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_(Cairo_suburb) "Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-10)

In [Egyptian mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_mythology "Egyptian mythology"), the obelisk symbolized the sun god [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra "Ra"), and during the religious reformation of [Akhenaten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten "Akhenaten") it was said to have been a petrified ray of the [Aten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aten "Aten"), the sundisk. [Benben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benben "Benben") was the mound that arose from the primordial waters [Nu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naunet "Naunet") upon which the creator god [Atum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atum "Atum") settled in the creation story of the [Heliopolitan creation myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_creation_myths "Ancient Egyptian creation myths") form of [Ancient Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") religion. The Benben stone (also known as a [pyramidion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidion "Pyramidion")) is the top stone of the Egyptian pyramid. It is also related to the obelisk.

Both [New York University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University "New York University")[Egyptologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptologist "Egyptologist") Patricia Blackwell Gary and _[Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy\_(magazine) "Astronomy (magazine)")_ senior editor Richard Talcott hypothesize that the shapes of the [ancient Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt")[pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid "Pyramid") and obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the sun (the sun-god [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra "Ra") being the Egyptians' greatest deity at that time).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-11) The [pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid "Pyramid") and obelisk's significance have been previously overlooked, especially the astronomical phenomena connected with [sunrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise "Sunrise") and [sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset "Sunset"): [Zodiacal light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light "Zodiacal light") and [sun pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_pillar "Sun pillar") respectively.

Ancient [Nubian kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubia "Nubia") of the [twenty-fifth Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt "Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt") sought to legitimize their rule over Egypt by constructing Egyptianizing monuments in the Middle Nile region. Historical sources mention that king [Piye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piye "Piye") built at least one obelisk. The obelisk was made of local [black granite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_granite "Black granite") and was found at the site of Kadakol. It had been cut down to make it into a column, presumably for one of the early Christian churches in the area of [Old Dongola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dongola "Old Dongola"). Today the obelisk is exhibited in the [National Museum in Khartoum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_in_Khartoum "National Museum in Khartoum").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-12) The obelisk is inscribed with the kings official titulary: _Strong-bull, Appearing-in-Dominion (Thebes), King-of-Upper-and-Lower-Egypt, Two-ladies, Ruler-of-Egypt, Son-of-Rê, Pi(ankh)y: what he made as his monument for his father Amen-Rê, lord of [...]_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-13)

#### Ancient Egyptian obelisks in Ancient Rome

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Obelisk&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Ancient Egyptian obelisks in Ancient Rome")]

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Hippodrome_Oblisk.jpg/250px-Hippodrome_Oblisk.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hippodrome_Oblisk.jpg)

The [Obelisk of Tuthmosis III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk_of_Theodosius "Obelisk of Theodosius"), [Istanbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul"), Turkey

Around 30 BCE, Rome seized control of Egypt and looted the various [temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_temple "Egyptian temple") complexes; in one case they destroyed walls at the [Temple of Karnak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnak "Karnak") to haul them out. There are now more than twice as many obelisks that were seized and shipped out by Rome as remain in Egypt. The majority were dismantled during the Roman period over 1,700 years ago and the obelisks were sent to different locations.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The largest standing and tallest Egyptian obelisk is the [Lateran Obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateran_Obelisk "Lateran Obelisk") in the square at the west side of the [Lateran Basilica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateran_Basilica "Lateran Basilica") in Rome at 105.6 feet (32.2 m) tall and a weight of 455 metric tons (502 short tons).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-PBS-Nile-mysteries-Rome-15) More well known is the [iconic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon "Cultural icon") 25 metres (82 ft), 331-metric-ton (365-short-ton) [Vatican obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_obelisk "Vatican obelisk") at [Saint Peter's Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter%27s_Square "Saint Peter's Square").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-PBS-Nile-mysteries-Rome-15) Brought to Rome by the Emperor [Caligula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula "Caligula") in 37 CE, it has stood at its current site and on the wall of the [Circus of Nero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_of_Nero "Circus of Nero"), flanking St Peter's Basilica.

> The elder [Pliny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder "Pliny the Elder") in his _[Natural History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny%27s\_Natural\_History "Pliny's Natural History")_ refers to the obelisk's transportation from Egypt to Rome by order of the Emperor Gaius (Caligula) as an outstanding event. The barge that carried it had a huge mast of fir wood which four men's arms could not encircle. One hundred and twenty bushels of lentils were needed for ballast. Having fulfilled its purpose, the gigantic vessel was no longer wanted. Therefore, filled with stones and cement, it was sunk to form the foundations of the foremost quay of the new harbour at [Ostia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica "Ostia Antica").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-16)

Pope [Sixtus V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixtus_V "Sixtus V") was determined to erect the obelisk in front of St Peter's, of which the nave was yet to be built. He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. [Domenico Fontana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domenico_Fontana "Domenico Fontana"), the assistant of [Giacomo Della Porta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Della_Porta "Giacomo Della Porta") in the Basilica's construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project. Half-buried in the debris of the ages, it was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the [Exaltation of the Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exaltation_of_the_Cross "Exaltation of the Cross"), was watched by a large crowd. It was a famous feat of engineering, which made the reputation of Fontana, who detailed it in a book illustrated with copperplate etchings, _Della Trasportatione dell'Obelisco Vaticano et delle Fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V_ (1590),[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-18) which itself set a new standard in communicating technical information and influenced subsequent architectural publications by its meticulous precision.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-19) Before being re-erected the obelisk was exorcised. It is said that Fontana had teams of relay horses to make his getaway if the enterprise failed. When [Carlo Maderno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Maderno "Carlo Maderno") came to build the Basilica's nave, he had to put the slightest kink in its axis, to line it precisely with the obelisk.

[Flaminio Obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaminio_Obelisk "Flaminio Obelisk") of [Ramesses II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II "Ramesses II") from [Heliopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_(Ancient_Egypt) "Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)") stands in the centre of the [Piazza del Popolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_del_Popolo "Piazza del Popolo"), [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome").

Three more obelisks were erected in Rome under Sixtus V: at [Santa Maria Maggiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria_Maggiore "Santa Maria Maggiore"), in 1587; at the Lateran Basilica, in 1588; and at the [Piazza del Popolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_del_Popolo "Piazza del Popolo"), in 1589.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-20) An obelisk stands in front of the church of [Trinità dei Monti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinit%C3%A0_dei_Monti "Trinità dei Monti"), at the head of the [Spanish Steps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Steps "Spanish Steps"). Other notable Egyptian obelisks in Rome are found in [Piazza della Minerva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_della_Minerva "Piazza della Minerva"), sculpted while being carried on the back of an [elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant "Elephant"), [Piazza Montecitorio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_Montecitorio "Piazza Montecitorio"), [Piazza della Rotonda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_della_Rotonda "Piazza della Rotonda"), the [Baths of Diocletian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baths_of_Diocletian "Baths of Diocletian"), and [Villa Celimontana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Celimontana "Villa Celimontana"). Rome lost one of its obelisks, the [Boboli obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boboli_obelisk "Boboli obelisk") which had decorated the temple of Isis, where it was uncovered in the 16th century. The Medici claimed it for the [Villa Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Medici "Villa Medici"), but in 1790 they moved it to the [Boboli Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boboli_Gardens "Boboli Gardens") attached to the [Palazzo Pitti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Pitti "Palazzo Pitti") in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence"), and left a replica in its place.

Not all the Egyptian obelisks in the Roman Empire were set up at Rome: [Herod the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_the_Great "Herod the Great") imitated his Roman patrons and set up an obelisk, [Caesarea obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarea_obelisk "Caesarea obelisk"), made out of Egyptian red granite in the [hippodrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippodrome "Hippodrome") of his new city [Caesarea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarea_Maritima "Caesarea Maritima") in northern [Judea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea "Judea"). This one is about 40 feet (12 m) tall and weighs about 100 metric tons (110 short tons).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-21) It was discovered by archaeologists and has been re-erected at its former site.

In 357 CE, Emperor [Constantius II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantius_II "Constantius II") had two Karnak Temple obelisks removed and transported down the [Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile "Nile") to [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria") to commemorate his _ventennalia_, the 20th year of his reign. Afterward, one was sent to Rome and erected on the _[spina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spina\_(Roman\_circus) "Spina (Roman circus)")_ of the [Circus Maximus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_Maximus "Circus Maximus"), and is today known as the Lateran Obelisk. The other one, known as the [Obelisk of Theodosius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk_of_Theodosius "Obelisk of Theodosius"), remained in Alexandria until 390 CE, when Emperor [Theodosius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I "Theodosius I") had it transported to Constantinople (now [Istanbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul")) and put up on the _spina_ of the [Hippodrome of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople "Hippodrome of Constantinople") (now Sultan Ahmet Square).[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-22) It once stood 95 feet (29 m) tall and weighed 380 metric tons (420 short tons); however, its lower section (which reputedly also once stood in the hippodrome) is now lost, reducing the obelisk's size to 65 feet (20 m).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-PBS-Nile-mysteries-Istanbul-23)

The [Dutch Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Golden_Age "Dutch Golden Age") painter [Bartholomeus Breenbergh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomeus_Breenbergh "Bartholomeus Breenbergh") placed an obelisk in the background of his 1655 painting _Joseph Sells Grain_

The Ancient Romans populated their city with 8 large and 42 small Egyptian obelisks. More have been re-erected elsewhere, and the best-known examples outside Rome are the pair of 21-metre (69 ft) 187-metric-ton (206-short-ton) [Cleopatra's Needles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra%27s_Needle_(London) "Cleopatra's Needle (London)") in [London, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") (21 metres or 69 feet), and [New York City, US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") (21 metres or 70 feet), and the 23-metre (75 ft) over-250-metric-ton (280-short-ton) [Luxor Obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor_Obelisk "Luxor Obelisk") at the [Place de la Concorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Concorde "Place de la Concorde") in [Paris, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris,_France "Paris, France").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-24)

Obelisks were being shipped out of [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt") as late as the nineteenth century when three of them were sent to [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London"), [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") and [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris"). Their transportation was covered by various newspapers.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-Paris_obelisk-25)

Obelisk monuments are also known from the [Assyrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria "Assyria") civilization, where they were erected as public monuments that commemorated the achievements of the Assyrian king.

The [British Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum "British Museum") possesses four Assyrian obelisks:

The [White Obelisk of Ashurnasirpal I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Obelisk_of_Ashurnasirpal_I "White Obelisk of Ashurnasirpal I") (named due to its colour), was discovered by [Hormuzd Rassam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormuzd_Rassam "Hormuzd Rassam") in 1853 at [Nineveh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineveh "Nineveh"). The obelisk was erected by either [Ashurnasirpal I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashurnasirpal_I "Ashurnasirpal I") (1050–1031 BCE) or [Ashurnasirpal II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashurnasirpal_II "Ashurnasirpal II") (883–859 BCE). The obelisk bears an inscription that refers to the king's seizure of goods, people and herds, which he carried back to the city of Ashur. The reliefs of the Obelisk depict military campaigns, hunting, victory banquets and scenes of tribute bearing.

The Rassam Obelisk, named after its discoverer [Hormuzd Rassam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormuzd_Rassam "Hormuzd Rassam"), was found on the citadel of [Nimrud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrud "Nimrud") (ancient Kalhu). It was erected by Ashurnasirpal II, though only survives in fragments. The surviving parts of the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing to the king from Syria and the west.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-26)

The [Black Obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Obelisk "Black Obelisk") was discovered by [Sir Austen Henry Layard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Austen_Henry_Layard "Sir Austen Henry Layard") in 1846 on the citadel of Kalhu. The obelisk was erected by [Shalmaneser III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalmaneser_III "Shalmaneser III") and the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing as well as the depiction of two subdued rulers, [Jehu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehu "Jehu") the Israelite, and Sua the Gilzanean, making gestures of submission to the king. The reliefs on the obelisk have accompanying epigraphs, but besides these the obelisk also possesses a longer inscription that records one of the latest versions of Shalmaneser III's annals, covering the period from his accessional year to his 33rd regnal year.

The Broken Obelisk, that was also discovered by Rassam at Nineveh. Only the top of this [monolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith "Monolith") has been reconstructed in the British Museum. The obelisk is the oldest recorded obelisk from Assyria, dating to the 11th century BCE.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-27)

The Romans commissioned obelisks in an ancient Egyptian style. Examples include:

It is 2.52 metres tall and was carved in a design of low relief with [Chavín](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chav%C3%ADn "Chavín") symbols, such as bands of teeth and animal heads. Long housed in the _[Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo\_Nacional\_de\_Arqueolog%C3%ADa,\_Antropolog%C3%ADa\_e\_Historia\_del\_Per%C3%BA "Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú")_ in [Lima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima "Lima"), it was relocated to the _Museo Nacional de Chavín_, which opened in July 2008. The obelisk was named for the archaeologist [Julio C. Tello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_C._Tello "Julio C. Tello"), who discovered it and was considered the 'father of Peruvian archaeology'. He was America's first [indigenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Indigenous peoples of the Americas") archaeologist.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-iowa-30)

### As commemorative monuments

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Obelisk&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: As commemorative monuments")]

Egyptian obelisks remain a source of fascination, serving as a reminder of past glories and a symbol of state power. A majority of modern obelisks are built of [masonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonry "Masonry") or [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete "Concrete"), so not monolithic like their Egyptian counterparts, and are often oversized. Examples from the 19th and 20th centuries include the [Obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk_at_Slottsbacken "Obelisk at Slottsbacken") (1800) in [Stockholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm "Stockholm"), [Stone of the Empress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keisarinnankivi "Keisarinnankivi") (1835) in [Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki "Helsinki"),[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-31) the [Wellington Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_Monument,_Dublin "Wellington Monument, Dublin") (1861) in [Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin "Dublin"), the [Washington Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monument "Washington Monument") (1884) in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.

### Transportation and erection experiments

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Obelisk&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Transportation and erection experiments")]

In late summer 1999, Roger Hopkins and [Mark Lehner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lehner "Mark Lehner") teamed up with a _[NOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova\_(American\_TV\_program) "Nova (American TV program)")_ crew to erect a 25-ton obelisk. This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a 2-ton obelisk and a 9-ton obelisk. Finally in August–September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully. First Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10–20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-35) Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are [listed here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_megalithic_sites#List_of_efforts_to_move_and_install_stones "List of megalithic sites").

One experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about 3.0 metres (10 ft) long and no more than 5 metric tons (5.5 short tons). A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to 61-metre-long (200 ft) and 30-metre-wide (100 ft). The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.

The final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15° had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-36)

This experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations. It seems to have been supported by a 3,000 year-old [papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus "Papyrus")[scroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scroll "Scroll") in which one scribe taunts another to erect a monument for "thy lord". The scroll reads "Empty the space that has been filled with sand beneath the monument of thy Lord."[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-37) To erect the obelisks at Luxor with this method would have involved using over a million cubic meters of stone, mud brick and sand for both the ramp and the platform used to lower the obelisk.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk#cite_note-38) The largest obelisk successfully erected in ancient times weighed 455 metric tons (502 short tons). A 520-metric-ton (570-short-ton) stele was found in [Axum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axum "Axum"), but researchers believe it was broken while attempting to erect it.
