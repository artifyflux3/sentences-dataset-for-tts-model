[ 3 ] It safely passed 1.27 lunar distances from Earth on 31 October 2015 at 17:01 UTC , [ 7 ] and passed by Earth again in November 2018.

Discovery [ edit ] Discovery image of 2015 TB 145 from the Pan-STARRS1 telescope, operated by the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii.

The asteroid was first observed on 10 October 2015 by Pan-STARRS at an apparent magnitude of 20 using a 1.8-meter (71 in) Ritchey–Chrétien telescope .

[ 1 ] [ 6 ] [ a ] The asteroid was not discovered sooner because it spends most of its time beyond the orbit of Mars , has a large orbital inclination, and is usually well below the plane of the ecliptic .

[ 9 ] The asteroid last passed within 0.064 AU (9,600,000 km ; 5,900,000 mi ) of Earth on 29 October 1923 and will not pass that close again until 1 November 2088.

[ 7 ] The media has nicknamed the asteroid the " Great Pumpkin " [ 10 ] after the animated Halloween television special It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown , [ 11 ] " Spooky ", [ 12 ] the " Halloween Asteroid ", [ 13 ] [ 14 ] and the " Skull Asteroid " [ 11 ] due to its skull -like appearance following radio frequency images taken at Arecibo Observatory and closest approach coincidentally occurring on Halloween day.

[ 11 ] 2015 flyby [ edit ] 2015 TB 145 passed 1.27 LD from the earth, and 0.75 LD from the moon.

On 31 October 2015 the asteroid passed 0.00191 AU (286,000 km ; 178,000 mi ) from the Moon and then passed 0.00325 AU (486,000 km; 302,000 mi) from Earth.

[ 7 ] The last approach this close by an object with absolute magnitude brighter than 20 was 2004 XP 14 on 3 July 2006 at 1.1 lunar distances. The next object this large known to pass this close to Earth is (137108) 1999 AN 10 that will pass about 1 lunar distance from Earth on 7 August 2027.

[ 15 ] It is estimated that there are about 2400 near-Earth asteroids 300–500 meters in diameter, of which about 1100 have been discovered.

[ 16 ] During closest approach to Earth the asteroid reached about apparent magnitude 10, [ 17 ] which is much too faint to be seen by the naked eye. Even at peak brightness, the asteroid was a challenging target for amateur astronomers with small telescopes, best seen in the Northern hemisphere . The glare from an 80% waning gibbous Moon also hindered observations.

[ citation needed ] At 11:00 UT the asteroid was in the constellation of Taurus about 9 degrees from the Moon and moving at a rate of 3.4 degrees per hour.

[ 17 ] At the time of closest approach of 17:00 UT the asteroid was in the constellation of Ursa Major about 56 degrees from the Moon and moving at a rate of 14.7 degrees per hour.

[ 17 ] After closest approach it quickly became too faint and too close to the Sun in the sky to be seen.

Buzzi at Schiaparelli Observatory ( observatory code 204), at apparent magnitude 21.

[ 19 ] The 11 November 2018 flyby was about 0.267 AU (39,900,000 km ; 24,800,000 mi ) from Earth.

[ 7 ] [ 20 ] Observations [ edit ] Radar imagery [ edit ] The close approach was studied with radar using Goldstone , the Green Bank Telescope , [ 15 ] and the Arecibo Observatory . It was one of the best radar targets of the year with a resolution as high as 2 meters (7 ft) per pixel.

[ 15 ] Bistatic radar images created with the Green Bank Telescope had a resolution of 4 meters (13 ft) per pixel.

[ 21 ] Arecibo images had a resolution of 7.5 meters (25 ft) per pixel.

[ 5 ] 30 October 31 October 12:55–13:08 UTC 1 November Possible cometary origin [ edit ] The high orbital inclination and eccentricity suggest 2015 TB 145 may be an extinct comet that has shed its volatiles after numerous passes around the Sun.

[ 5 ] [ 22 ] Orbital calculations by Petrus Jenniskens and Jérémie Vaubaillon showed that it was not expected to produce associated meteors in 2015.

[ 23 ] Any meteoroids were expected to pass more than 0.0007 AU (100,000 km; 65,000 mi) from Earth's orbit.

[ 23 ] If meteoroids related to this asteroid were to cross Earth's path, the radiant is expected to be near Northern Eridanus .

[ 23 ] Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) did not detect any activity in the presumed area of the sky during 2013 and 2014.

[ 23 ] The object has a low albedo of 0.06, which is only slightly more than a typical comet that has an albedo of 0.03-0.05.

[ 5 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ For comparison, around 6 October 2012, the asteroid peaked at about apparent magnitude 20.9, but had a solar elongation of only about 75 degrees while 0.4 AU from Earth.
