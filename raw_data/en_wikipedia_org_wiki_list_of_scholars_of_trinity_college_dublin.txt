Described by Trinity College as "the most prestigious undergraduate award in the country", [ 1 ] Foundation Scholarship ("Schols") examinations have been held annually at Trinity since its establishment in 1592.

Schols is awarded to those who achieve a first class honours average in a set of challenging voluntary examinations, held in January the week before Hilary term begins, which test a student's ability to "consistently demonstrate exceptional knowledge and understanding of their subjects".

[ 1 ] Benefits include waived fees, a small salary, rooms in college, dining rights at Commons, Seanad voting privileges and a post-nominal title, "Sch.". Typically, less than 1% of the undergraduate population is awarded the scholarship.

Many scholars have gone on to acclaim in a range of fields over the past five centuries, both in academia and the wider world.

[ tone ] Former scholars include two Nobel Prize winners, one head of state ( Mary Robinson ), several government ministers, an Academy Award nominee ( Lenny Abrahamson ), and nine Provosts of Trinity College Dublin itself.
