It is situated on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary , near the Irish Sea , 178 miles (286 km) northwest of London . It had a population of 496,770 in 2022 [ 3 ] and is the administrative, cultural, and economic centre of the Liverpool City Region , a combined authority area with a population of over 1.5 million.

[ 5 ] Established as a borough in Lancashire in 1207, Liverpool became significant in the late 17th century when the Port of Liverpool was heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade . The port also imported cotton for the Lancashire textile mills , and became a major departure point for English and Irish emigrants to North America. Liverpool rose to global economic importance at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century and was home to the first intercity railway , the first non-combustible warehouse system (the Royal Albert Dock ), and a pioneering elevated electrical railway ; it was granted city status in 1880 and was moved from Lancashire to the newly created county of Merseyside in 1974 . It entered a period of decline in the mid-20th century, which was largely reversed after the European Union selected it as the European Capital of Culture for 2008, [ a ] reportedly generating over £800 million for the local economy within a year.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] The economy of Liverpool is diverse and encompasses tourism, culture , maritime , hospitality , healthcare , life sciences , advanced manufacturing, creative , and digital sectors.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The city is home to the UK's second highest number of art galleries , national museums , listed buildings , and parks and open spaces , behind only London.

[ 11 ] It is often used as a filming location due to its architecture and was the fifth most visited UK city by foreign tourists in 2022.

[ 12 ] It has produced numerous musicians , most notably the Beatles , and recording artists from the city have had more UK No. 1 singles than anywhere else in the world.

[ 13 ] It has also produced numerous academics , actors , artists , comedians , filmmakers , poets , scientists , sportspeople , and writers . It is the home of Premier League football teams Everton and Liverpool . The world's oldest still-operating mainline train station, Liverpool Lime Street , is in the city centre; it is also served by the underground Merseyrail network. The city's port was the fourth largest in the UK in 2023, with numerous shipping and freight lines having headquarters and offices there.

[ 14 ] Residents of Liverpool are formally known as Liverpudlians but are more often called Scousers in reference to scouse , a local stew made popular by sailors. The city's distinct local accent is also primarily known as Scouse. Its cultural and ethnic diversity is the result of attracting immigrants from various areas, particularly Ireland, Scandinavia, and Wales; it is also home to the UK's oldest black community and Europe's oldest Chinese community , as well as the first mosque in England.

[ 15 ] Toponymy The name comes from the Old English lifer , meaning thick or muddy water, and pōl , meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as Liuerpul .

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] According to the Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names , "The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained".

[ 18 ] Other origins of the name have been suggested, including "elverpool", a reference to the large number of eels in the Mersey .

[ 19 ] The adjective "Liverpudlian" was first recorded in 1833.

[ 17 ] History Main articles: History of Liverpool and Timeline of Liverpool The earliest-known image of Liverpool, in 1680 A map of Liverpool's original seven streets (north to the left) Bluecoat Chambers , completed in 1725, the oldest surviving building in Liverpool city centre Early history In the Middle Ages , Liverpool first existed as farmland within the West Derby Hundred [ 20 ] before growing into a small town of farmers, fishermen and tradesmen and tactical army base for King John of England . The town was planned with its own castle , although due to outbreaks of disease and its subordinance to the nearby Roman port of Chester , the town's growth and prosperity stagnated until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. There was substantial growth in the mid- to late 18th century, when the town became the most heavily involved European port in the Atlantic slave trade .

[ 21 ] King John 's letters patent of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool (then spelt as Liuerpul ). There is no evidence that the place had previously been a centre of any trade. The borough was probably created because King John decided that it would be a convenient place to embark men and supplies for his Irish campaigns : in particular his Irish campaign of 1209 .

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter , making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in the shape of a double cross: Bank Street (now Water Street ), Castle Street , Chapel Street , Dale Street , Juggler Street (now High Street ), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street ) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street ).

[ 23 ] Liverpool Castle was built before 1235, and survived until it was demolished in the 1720s.

[ 24 ] By the middle of the 16th century, the population was still around 600, although this was likely to have fallen from an earlier peak of 1,000 people due to slow trade and the effects of the plague .

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] In the 17th century, there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for control of the town were waged during the English Civil War , including a brief siege in 1644.

[ 28 ] In 1699, the same year as its first recorded slave ship , Liverpool Merchant , set sail for Africa, [ 29 ] Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament . But arguably, the legislation of 1695 that reformed the Liverpool council was of more significance to its subsequent development.

[ 30 ] Since Roman times nearby Chester on the River Dee had been the region's principal port on the Irish Sea . However, as the Dee began to silt up , maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring River Mersey . The first of the Liverpool docks was constructed in 1715, and the system of docks gradually grew into a large interconnected system.

[ 31 ] As trade from the West Indies , including sugar, surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the River Dee continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow even faster. The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Substantial profits from the slave trade and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including William Rathbone , William Roscoe and Edward Rushton , were at the forefront of the local abolitionist movement .

Statues of Prince Albert , Disraeli , Queen Victoria and Wellington's Column in the middle ground.

The 19th century saw Liverpool rise to global economic importance. Pioneering arose, and world-first technology and civic facilities launched in the city to serve the accelerating population, one that was fuelled by an influx of ethnic and religious communities from all around the world.

By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway . The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when Irish migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine . While many Irish people settled in the city at that time, a large percentage also emigrated to the United States or moved to the industrial centres of Lancashire , Yorkshire, and the Midlands .

[ 35 ] English Wikisource has original text related to this article: 'Liverpool', a poetical illustration by L. E. L.

In her poetical illustration "Liverpool" (1832), which celebrates the city's worldwide commerce, Letitia Elizabeth Landon refers specifically to the Macgregor Laird expedition to the Niger River, at that time in progress.

[ 36 ] This is accompanied by a painting by Samuel Austin , Liverpool, from the Mersey .

[ 37 ] Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the Deep South of the United States, which fed the textile industry in the country. Given the crucial place cotton held in the city's economy, during the American Civil War Liverpool was, in the words of historian Sven Beckert , "the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself".

[ 38 ] Liverpool merchants helped to bring out cotton from ports blockaded by the Union Navy , built ships of war for the Confederacy , and supplied
the South with military equipment and credit.

[ 39 ] During the war, the Confederate Navy ship, the CSS Alabama , was built at Birkenhead on the Mersey, and the CSS Shenandoah surrendered there (being the final surrender at the end of the war). The city was also the centre of Confederate purchases of war materiel, including arms and ammunition, uniforms, and naval supplies to be smuggled by British blockade runners to the South .

[ 40 ] For periods during the 19th century, the wealth of Liverpool exceeded that of London, [ 41 ] and Liverpool's Custom House was the single largest contributor to the British Exchequer .

[ 42 ] Liverpool was the only British city ever to have its own Whitehall office.

[ 43 ] During this century, at least 40% of the world's entire trade passed through Liverpool.

[ 44 ] In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry, in recognition of which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the city.

[ 45 ] As early as 1851, the city was described as "the New York of Europe".

[ 46 ] During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was attracting immigrants from across Europe. This resulted in the construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The Deutsche Kirche , Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas , Gustav Adolf Church and Princes Road Synagogue were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches, St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church , served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship.

20th century Liverpool's Lime Street area pictured from above in 1946 The 20th century saw Liverpool's established rank as a global economic powerhouse challenged. Its strategic location as an international seaport made it particularly vulnerable in two World wars .

Economic depressions (both in the United Kingdom and across the world), changing housing patterns and containerisation in the maritime industry contributed to a downtrend in the city's productivity and prosperity. Despite this, the city's influence on global popular culture excelled and by the end of the century, the continuing process of urban renewal paved the way for the redefined modern city of the 21st century.

The period after the Great War was marked by social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to re-integrate veterans into civilian life and the economy. Unemployment and poor living standards greeted many ex-servicemen.

Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations, including a police strike in Liverpool among the City Police . Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the British Armed Forces , settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919, they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants , and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing. In this period, race riots also took place in other port cities.

[ 47 ] The Housing Act 1919 resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1920s and 1930s, as much as 15% of the city's population (around 140,000 people) was relocated from the inner-city to new purpose built, lower density suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though the overall benefits have been contested.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] Numerous private homes were also built during this era. During the Great Depression of the early 1930s, unemployment peaked at around 30% in the city. Liverpool was the site of Britain's first provincial airport , operating from 1930.

During the Second World War , the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both Hitler and Churchill . The city was heavily bombed by the Germans, suffering a blitz second only to London's.

[ 50 ] The pivotal Battle of the Atlantic was planned, fought and won from Liverpool.

[ 51 ] The Luftwaffe made 80 air raids on Merseyside , killing 2,500 people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock , the largest dock project in Britain. Since 1952, Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne , Germany, a city that also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war. In the 1950s and 1960s, much of the immediate reconstruction that took place in the city centre proved to be deeply unpopular. The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. It has been argued that the so-called "Shankland Plan" of the 1960s, named after the town planner Graeme Shankland , led to compromised town planning and vast road-building schemes that devastated and divided inner city neighbourhoods. Concrete brutalist architecture , compromised visions, botched projects and grand designs that were never realised became the subject of condemnation. Historian Raphael Samuel labelled Graeme Shankland "the butcher of Liverpool".

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] A West Indian black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to Commonwealth immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area. More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as Toxteth , where housing was less expensive. The black population of Liverpool was recorded at 1.90% in 2011. In the 2021 Census , 5.2% described themselves as black African, Caribbean, mixed white and black African, mixed white and Caribbean or 'other black'.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] Mathew Street is one of many tourist attractions related to the Beatles, and the location of The Cavern Club and Liverpool Wall of Fame .

In the 1960s, Liverpool was the centre of the " Merseybeat " sound whose best-known band is the Beatles .

Liverpool Airport was renamed after Beatle and Liverpudlian John Lennon in 2002, the first British airport to be named in honour of an individual.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] Previously part of Lancashire, and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool became a metropolitan borough within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside , in 1974. From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of containerisation meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were made unemployed. By the early 1980s, unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK, [ 60 ] standing at 17% by January 1982 although, this was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression some 50 years previously.

[ 61 ] During this period, Liverpool became a hub of fierce left-wing opposition to the central government in London.

[ 62 ] Liverpool in the 1980s has been labelled as Britain's 'shock city'. Once the acclaimed second city of the British Empire which rivalled the capital city in global significance, Liverpool had collapsed in to its 'nadir' at the depths of post-colonial , post-industrial Britain.

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] In the late 20th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. The late 1980s saw the opening of a regenerated Albert Dock which proved to be a catalyst for further regeneration.

[ 65 ] In the mid-1990s, the city enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average. At the end of the 20th century, Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process that continues today.

21st century The Liverpool Cruise Terminal and surrounding office and residential developments, part of the Liverpool Waters megaproject Ongoing regeneration combined with the hosting of internationally significant events has helped to re-purpose Liverpool as one of the most visited, tourist orientated, cities in the United Kingdom. City leaders are focussing on long-term strategies to grow the city's population and economy, while national government explores the continuous potential for devolution in the city.

In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Liverpool to mark the Golden Jubilee . On speaking to an audience at Liverpool Town Hall , the Queen recognised Liverpool as "one of the most distinctive and energetic parts of the United Kingdom", and paid tribute to the city's "major orchestras, world-class museums and galleries". She also acknowledged Liverpool's bid to become the European Capital of Culture .

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] To celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife organised a competition to choose county flowers ; the sea-holly was Liverpool's final choice. The initiative was designed to highlight growing threats to the UK's flower species and also ask the public about which flowers best represented their county.

[ 68 ] Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as the Beatles , as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism and culture have become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy.

Modern developments on the Liverpool Waterfront In 2004, property developer Grosvenor started the Paradise Project , a £920 million development based on Paradise Street . This produced one of the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed as ' Liverpool One ,' the centre opened in May 2008.

In 2007, events and celebrations took place in honour of the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool. Liverpool was designated as a joint European Capital of Culture for 2008. The celebrations included the erection of La Princesse , a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, which represented the "eight legs" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture.

La Princesse roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the Queensway Tunnel .

Spearheaded by the multi-billion- pound Liverpool ONE development, regeneration continued throughout the 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects included new buildings in the Commercial District , King's Dock , Mann Island , around Lime Street , the Baltic Triangle , RopeWalks , and Edge Lane .

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Headquarters of Liverpool City Region Combined Authority , which invests in Liverpool's major infrastructure and regeneration projects Changes to Liverpool's governance took place in 2014. The local authority of Liverpool City Council decided to pool its power and resources with surrounding boroughs through the formation of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority in a form of devolution . With a devolved budget granted by central government , the authority now oversees and invests in foremost strategic affairs throughout the Liverpool City Region , including major regeneration projects. The authority, along with Liverpool City Council itself, has embarked on long-term plans to grow the population and economy of the city.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] By the 2020s, urban regeneration throughout the city continues.

Liverpool Waters , a mixed-use development in the city's disused northern docklands, has been identified as one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history.

Everton's new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock was regarded as the largest single-site private sector development in the United Kingdom at the time of construction.

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] Major events, business and political conferences regularly take place in the city and form an important part of the economy. In June 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron launched the International Festival for Business in Liverpool, the world's largest business event in 2014, [ 78 ] and the largest in the UK since the Festival of Britain in 1951.

[ 79 ] The Labour Party has chosen Liverpool numerous times since the mid 2010s for their annual Labour Party Conference . Liverpool hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 .

Inventions and innovations The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine , the first such school in the world Liverpool has been a centre of invention and innovation. Railways, transatlantic steamships , municipal trams, [ 80 ] and electric trains were all pioneered in Liverpool as modes of mass transit. In 1829 and 1836, the first railway tunnels in the world were constructed under Liverpool ( Wapping Tunnel ). From 1950 to 1951, the world's first scheduled passenger helicopter service ran between Liverpool and Cardiff .

[ 81 ] The first School for the Blind , [ 82 ] Mechanics' Institute , [ 83 ] High School for Girls, [ 84 ] [ 85 ] council house, [ 86 ] and Juvenile Court [ 87 ] were all founded in Liverpool. Charities such as the RSPCA , [ 88 ] NSPCC , [ 89 ] Age Concern , [ 90 ] Relate , and Citizen's Advice Bureau [ 91 ] all evolved from work in the city.

The first lifeboat station, public bath and wash-house, [ 92 ] sanitary act, [ 93 ] medical officer for health ( William Henry Duncan ), district nurse, slum clearance , [ 94 ] purpose-built ambulance, [ 95 ] X-ray medical diagnosis, [ 96 ] school of tropical medicine ( Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine ), motorised municipal fire-engine, [ 97 ] free school meal, [ 98 ] cancer research centre, [ 99 ] and zoonosis research centre [ 100 ] all originated in Liverpool. The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to Ronald Ross , professor at the School of Tropical Medicine, the first school of its kind in the world.

[ 101 ] Orthopaedic surgery was pioneered in Liverpool by Hugh Owen Thomas , [ 102 ] and modern medical anaesthetics by Thomas Cecil Gray .

The world's first integrated sewer system was constructed in Liverpool by James Newlands , appointed in 1847 as the UK's first borough engineer.

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] Liverpool also founded the UK's first Underwriters' Association [ 105 ] and the first Institute of Accountants . The Western world's first financial derivatives (cotton futures) were traded on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in the late 1700s.

[ 106 ] Oriel Chambers , the first "modern" building in the world with its iron-framed curtain-wall In the arts, Liverpool was home to the first lending library ( The Lyceum ), athenaeum society ( Liverpool Athenaeum ), arts centre ( Bluecoat Chambers ), [ 107 ] and public art conservation centre ( National Conservation Centre ).

[ 108 ] It is also home to the UK's oldest surviving classical orchestra ( Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra ) [ 109 ] and repertory theatre ( Liverpool Playhouse ).

[ 110 ] In 1864, Peter Ellis built the world's first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building, Oriel Chambers , which was a prototype of the skyscraper. The UK's first purpose-built department store was Compton House , completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey.

[ 111 ] It was the largest store in the world at the time.

[ 112 ] Lewis's department store on Ranelagh Street. In 1879, the Christmas grotto was conceived in the store.

Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival . Devised by John Hulley and Charles Pierre Melly , these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook.

[ 113 ] [ 114 ] The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics.

[ 115 ] In 1865, Hulley co-founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association . Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the Olympic Charter .

A concept devised by retail entrepreneur David Lewis , the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis's department store in Liverpool in 1879.

[ 116 ] Sir Alfred Lewis Jones , a shipowner, introduced bananas to the UK via Liverpool's docks in 1884.

[ 117 ] The Mersey Railway , opened in 1886, incorporated the world's first tunnel under a tidal estuary [ 118 ] and the world's first deep-level underground stations ( Liverpool James Street railway station ).

Liverpool was the first city outside London to be chosen to have an official Blue plaque and now has the largest number outside London.

[ 119 ] In 1889, borough engineer John Alexander Brodie invented the football goal net. He was also a pioneer in the use of pre-fabricated housing [ 120 ] and oversaw the construction of the UK's first ring road ( A5058 ) and intercity highway ( East Lancashire Road ), as well as the Queensway Tunnel linking Liverpool and Birkenhead . Described as "the eighth wonder of the world" at the time of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world for 24 years.

In 1897, the Lumière brothers filmed Liverpool, [ 121 ] including what is believed to be the world's first tracking shot , [ 122 ] taken from the Liverpool Overhead Railway , the world's first elevated electrified railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use electric multiple units , employ automatic signalling, and install an escalator.

Liverpool inventor Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture, producing three of the most popular lines of toys in the 20th century: Meccano , Hornby Model Railways (both in 1901), and Dinky Toys in 1934.

[ 123 ] The British Interplanetary Society , founded in Liverpool in 1933 by Phillip Ellaby Cleator, is the world's oldest existing organisation devoted to the promotion of spaceflight . Its journal, the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society , is the longest-running astronautical publication in the world.

[ 124 ] In 1999, Liverpool was the first city outside London to be awarded blue plaques by English Heritage in recognition of the "significant contribution made by its sons and daughters in all walks of life".

[ 125 ] Government See also: Merseyside and Liverpool City Region The Cunard Building (left), housing the main offices of Liverpool City Council For the purposes of local government , Liverpool is classified as a metropolitan borough with city status. The metropolitan borough is located within both the county of Merseyside and the Liverpool City Region . Each of these geographical areas is treated as an administrative area with different levels of local governance applying to each.

Liverpool City Council is the governing body solely for the Metropolitan Borough of Liverpool and performs functions that are standard of an English Unitary Authority . 
The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region reserve major strategic powers over such things as transport, economic development and regeneration for the city along with the 5 surrounding boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Combined Authority has competency over areas which have been devolved by national government and are specific to the city region.

[ 126 ] Nevertheless, there are a few exceptions to local governance apart from these two structures. Liverpool was administered by Merseyside County Council between 1974 and 1986 and some residual aspects of organisation which date back to this time have survived. When the County Council was disbanded in 1986, most civic functions were transferred to Liverpool City Council. However, several authorities such as the police and fire and rescue service , continue to be run at a county-wide level. The county of Merseyside, therefore, continues to exist as an administrative area for a few limited services only, while the capability and capacity of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is evolving over time.

[ 127 ] The city also elects five members of Parliament (MPs) to the Westminster Parliament , all Labour as of the 2024 general election.

Liverpool City Council City Council Leader and Cabinet City Councillors meet regularly at the Council Chamber in Liverpool Town Hall to conduct civic business.

[ 128 ] Liverpool City Council operates under a constitution comprising 85 city councillors who are directly elected by the Liverpool electorate every four years and represent a variety of different political parties . The city councillors make decisions about local services for the city's people.

At each election, the political party that wins the majority of the 85 council seats leads the council for the following four years. The local leader of this party assumes the role of Leader of the City Council who then chairs a Cabinet of 9 councillors who are assigned specific responsibilities known as 'portfolios'.

The incumbent Leader of Liverpool City Council is Councillor Liam Robinson , who represents the Labour Party , which secured a large majority at the 2023 local election , [ 129 ] the Leader is also a member of the Mayor of the Liverpool City Regions cabinet ( Separate from the City Council Cabinet ), at present Robinson holds the portfolio of Cabinet Member for Innovation.

The City Council's decisions and scrutiny of activities are undertaken by a number of different committees and panels which include the Overview and Scrutiny Committees, Scrutiny Panels, Regulatory Committees and other committees. The day-to-day management of the council is carried out by the management team which includes the Chief Executive and several directors and senior officers. The management team works with the Cabinet and councillors to deliver strategic direction and priorities such as the budget and the City Plan.

[ 130 ] [ 131 ] Liverpool City Council elections Main articles: Liverpool City Council and Liverpool City Council elections Every four years, the city elects 85 councillors from 64 local council wards .

[ 132 ] During the 2023 Liverpool City Council election , the Labour Party consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following on from the previous elections. Out of the total 85 City Council seats up for election, The Labour Party won 61 seats (53.13% of the electorate's total votes), the Liberal Democrats won 15 seats (21.61% of the votes), the Green Party won three seats (9.76% of the votes), the Liverpool Community Independents won three seats (4.64% of the votes) and the Liberal Party won the remaining three seats (3.21% of the votes). The Conservative Party , the political party in power at national government , had no representation on Liverpool City Council. Only 27.27% of the eligible Liverpool electorate turned out to vote.

[ 133 ] Steve Rotheram , Mayor of the Liverpool City Region Paula Barker , MP for Liverpool Wavertree Ian Byrne , MP for Liverpool West Derby Dan Carden , MP for Liverpool Walton Maria Eagle , MP for Liverpool Garston Kim Johnson , MP for Liverpool Riverside Throughout most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was a municipal stronghold of Toryism . However, support for the Conservative Party in recent times has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the monetarist economic policies of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher . After the 1979 general election , many have claimed that her victory contributed to longstanding high unemployment and decline in the city.

[ 134 ] Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however, the city has also seen hard times under Labour governments. Particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom, but also when it suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied for long periods.

[ 135 ] City Council criticism and improvement In recent years, Liverpool City Council began an extensive improvement program designed to ensure that the authority makes efficient use of taxpayers ' money and to encourage more business and investment in the city.

Grosvenor Group , the property company responsible for Liverpool One , commended the changes as an "opportunity for bold thinking in liverpool".

[ 136 ] In 2021, a highly critical government inspection and subsequent report of Liverpool City Council (referred to as the Caller report) identified multiple shortcomings at Liverpool City Council. The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government , Robert Jenrick sent government commissioners to oversee the City Council's highways, regeneration, property management, governance and financial decision-making. The authority was compelled to commit to a three-year improvement plan in which the entire structure of the council would be overhauled. As a result of the intervention, major structural changes at the City Council took place by the 2023 United Kingdom local elections , which were labelled "the most unpredictable [elections] in the city's history". The number of electoral wards in the city was doubled from 30 to 64, while the overall number of city councillors up for election was reduced from 90 to 85. In future, the council would also change to 'all out' elections every four years whereby every single city councillor would be eligible for re-election at the same time. The role of elected city mayor was also abolished and the Council reverted to the previous Leader and Cabinet style of leadership. The outcome of the elections were seen not only as a test of how the general public would respond to the government intervention in the city, but also to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 's government as a whole.

[ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] Liam Robinson became the new Leader of Liverpool City Council at the 2023 City Council election. The Liverpool Strategic Futures Advisory Panel, chaired by the Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram , and including several high-profile figures with experience in local government , was established. The panel was tasked with directing the council's long-term future outside of government intervention measures and to advise on plans and priorities that the city should pursue.

[ 141 ] Liverpool Town Hall houses the official office for the Lord Mayor of Liverpool In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was reported to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one-star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a £20 million shortfall while the city held the title of European Capital of Culture .

[ 142 ] In April 2024, the Office for Local Government released a ranking of local authorities, placing Liverpool City Council 317th out of a possible 318.

[ 143 ] Lord Mayor of Liverpool Not to be confused with elected Mayor of the Liverpool City Region See below.

The Lord Mayor of Liverpool is an ancient ceremonial role. Councillors within Liverpool City Council (not the general public) elect the Lord Mayor annually, who then serves a one-year term. The Lord Mayor is styled as the "first citizen" and is chosen to represent the city at civic functions and engagements, promote it to the wider world, support local charities and community groups, attend religious events, meet delegates from Liverpool's twin cities , chair council meetings and confer Honorary Freemen and associations .

[ 144 ] The Lord Mayor is also the presiding officer for Liverpool City Council full meetings.

Mayor of the Liverpool City Region 1 Mann Island contains the offices of the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region and combined authority.

Liverpool is one of the six constituent boroughs of the Liverpool City Region . The Mayor of the Liverpool City Region is directly every four years by residents of those six boroughs and oversees the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority . The Combined Authority is the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and is tasked with taking major strategic decisions on issues such as transport and investment, economic development, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure. The current Mayor is Steve Rotheram .

Parliamentary constituencies and MPs See also: List of Parliamentary constituencies on Merseyside Liverpool is included within five parliamentary constituencies , through which MPs are elected to represent the city in Westminster : Liverpool Garston , Liverpool Riverside , Liverpool Walton , Liverpool Wavertree and Liverpool West Derby .

[ 145 ] At the last general election , all were won by Labour with representation being from Maria Eagle , Kim Johnson , Dan Carden , Paula Barker and Ian Byrne respectively.

Rainfall and temperature records had been kept at Bidston Hill since 1867, but records for atmospheric pressure go back as far as at least 1846.

[ 148 ] Bidston closed down in 2002 but the Met Office also has a weather station at Crosby . Since records began in 1867, temperatures have ranged from −17.6 °C (0.3 °F) on 21 December 2010 to 34.5 °C (94.1 °F) on 2 August 1990, although Liverpool Airport recorded a temperature of 35.0 °C (95.0 °F) on 19 July 2006.

[ 149 ] The lowest amount of sunshine on record was 16.5 hours in December 1927 whereas the most was 314.5 hours in July 2013.

[ 150 ] [ 151 ] Tornado activity or funnel cloud formation is very rare in and around the Liverpool area and tornadoes that do form are usually weak. Recent tornadoes or funnel clouds in Merseyside have been seen in 1998 and 2014.

[ 152 ] [ 153 ] During the period 1981–2010, Crosby recorded an average of 32.8 days of air frost per year, which is low for the United Kingdom.

[ 154 ] Snow is fairly common during the winter although heavy snow is rare. Snow generally falls between November and March but can occasionally fall earlier and later. In recent times, the earliest snowfall was on 1 October 2008 [ 155 ] while the latest occurred on 15 May 2012.

[ 156 ] Although historically, the earliest snowfall occurred on 10 September 1908 [ 157 ] and the latest on 2 June 1975.

[ 158 ] Rainfall, although light, is quite a common occurrence in Liverpool, with the wettest month on record being August 1956, which recorded 221.2 mm (8.71 in) of rain and the driest being February 1932, with 0.9 mm (0.035 in).

[ 169 ] Green belt Further information: North West Green Belt Liverpool is a core urban element of a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, which is in place to reduce urban sprawl , prevent the towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.

[ 170 ] Due to being already highly built up, the city contains limited portions of protected green belt area within greenfield throughout the borough at Fazakerley , Croxteth Hall and country park and Craven Wood, Woodfields Park and nearby golf courses in Netherley , small greenfield tracts east of the Speke area by the St Ambrose primary school, and the small hamlet of Oglet and the surrounding area south of Liverpool Airport .

[ 171 ] The green belt was first drawn up in 1983 under Merseyside County Council [ 172 ] and the size in the city amounts to 530 hectares (5.3 km 2 ; 2.0 sq mi).

[ 173 ] Demonyms Scouser "Scousers" redirects here. For the Harry Enfield sketch, see The Scousers .

Since the mid-20th century, Scouser has become the predominant demonym for the inhabitants of Liverpool, and is strongly associated with the Scouse accent and dialect of the city.

[ 174 ] The Scouse accent is described as progressively diverging from the Lancastrian accent in the late 19th century.

[ 175 ] [ 176 ] [ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] The etymology of Scouser is derived from the traditional dish Scouse brought to the area by sailors travelling through Liverpool's port.

[ 179 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] Earlier demonyms Earlier terms used to refer to inhabitants of Liverpool include: Liverpoldon (17th century) [ 182 ] Leeirpooltonian (17th century) [ 179 ] Liverpolitan (19th century) [ 183 ] Liverpudlian (19th century to present) [ 184 ] Professor Tony Crowley writes that up until the 1950s, inhabitants of Liverpool were generally referred to by a number of demonyms, including, in the mid-20th century, the rival terms of 'Liverpolitan' and 'Liverpudlian'. Debate surrounded the lexicology of these terms and their connotations of social class.

[ 181 ] [ 185 ] Professor John Belchem suggests that a series of other nicknames such as 'Dick Liver', 'Dicky Sam' and 'whacker' were used, but gradually fell out of use. Belchem and Philip Boland suggest that comedic radio presenters and entertainers brought the Liverpool identity to a national audience, which in turn encouraged locals to be gradually more known as 'scousers'. By the time that Frank Shaw's My Liverpool, a Celebration of 'Scousetown' was published in 1971, Belchem argues, 'Scouser' had firmly become the dominant demonym.

The economy was focused on agricultural and food processing, grain mills and warehouses until the 16th century.

1272 840 14th century 1,000 – 1,200 Population roughly 1,000 in 1300. Because Liverpool was a port, it was more at risk from the spread of disease. Townspeople lived partly by farming and fishing. Some were craftsmen or tradesmen such as bakers, brewers, butchers, blacksmiths, and carpenters. A watermill existed to ground grain into flour for the townspeople's bread, and there was a windmill.

Black Death wiped out whole families and bodies were buried in a mass grave at St Nicholas's churchyard .

16th century Ireland was still Liverpool's main trading partner. In 1540, a writer said: "Irish merchants come much hither as to a good harbor". He also said there was "good merchandise at Liverpool and much Irish yarn , that Manchester men buy there". Skins and hides were still imported from Ireland. Exports from Liverpool included coal, woolen cloth, knives and leather goods. There were still many fishermen in Liverpool. In the mid 16th century, the town was under the control of the country gentry and trade was slow. The population dropped to below 600, in part due to deaths in the 1558 plague when a third of the townspeople died. Further plague outbreaks took place in 1609, 1647 and 1650 which led to static or retrogressive population levels. The town was regarded as subordinate to Chester until the 1650s.

1600 <2,000 English troops bound for rebellions in Ireland settled in the 16th and early 17th centuries.

1626 Charles I of England issued new Charter for the town. Trade with other cities, Ireland, Isle of Man , France and Spain increased. Fish and wool was exported to the Continent , and wines, iron and other commodities imported. In the following decades, merchants invested in Liverpool and its importance grew. Regular shipping began to America and West Indies . Liverpool was controlled by the Crown , the Molyneux and Stanley families.

1642 2,500 Liverpool overtook Chester in exporting coal and salt in early 17th century, especially to Ireland.

1644 During English Civil War , Prince Rupert led a royalist army to capture Liverpool. He described the town as a "mere crow's nest which a parcel of boys could take". He stormed Liverpool Castle in the 'Siege of Liverpool' with considerable slaughter.

1647 Liverpool was made a free and independent port, no longer subject to Chester .

1648 First recorded cargo from America landed at Liverpool.

Late 17th century Liverpool grew rapidly with the growth of English colonies in North America and West Indies . Liverpool was well placed to trade across Atlantic Ocean. The writer Celia Fiennes visited Liverpool and said: "Liverpool is built on the River Mersey . It is mostly newly built, of brick and stone after the London fashion. The original (town) was a few fishermen's houses. It has now grown into a large, fine town. It is but one parish with one church though there be 24 streets in it, there is indeed a little chapel and there are a great many dissenters in the town ( Protestants who did not belong to the Church of England ). It's a very rich trading town, the houses are of brick and stone, built high and even so that a street looks very handsome. The streets are well paved. There is an abundance of persons who are well dressed and fashionable. The streets are fair and long. It's London in miniature as much as I ever saw anything. There is a very pretty exchange. It stands on 8 pillars, over which is a very handsome Town Hall ." 1700 5,714 First recorded Liverpool slave ship , the 'Liverpool Merchant', sold a cargo of 220 slaves in Barbados. In the early 1700s, the writer Daniel Defoe said: "Liverpool has an opulent, flourishing and increasing trade to Virginia and English colonies in America. They trade around the whole island (of Great Britain), send ships to Norway , to Hamburg , and to the Baltic as also to Holland and Flanders (roughly modern Belgium )." Welsh people in search of work and opportunity made up a large amount of population in the early 18th century.

1715 World's first wet dock opened in Liverpool, symbolising a new era in the town's growth, the starting point of the 18th-century boom in Liverpool's fortunes.

1720s Liverpool Castle demolished (built in the 1230s) 1750 20,000 1795 Influx of Irish, Welsh , Scandinavian and Dutch communities grew the town rapidly. Most of the population were not native to Liverpool.

Liverpool was second only to London in importance. Poor, overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions led to disease and epidemics of cholera in 1830s to 1860s.

1841 286,487 1851 375,955 At the height of the Great Famine in Ireland , Liverpool's Irish-born population peaked to about 83,000–90,000. Forty-three thousand were settled in the area around the docks. More Irish people lived in Liverpool than the majority of Irish towns . Forty per cent of the world's trade was passing through Liverpool's docks .

1951 765,641 – 768,337 1961 683,133 – 737,637 1971 595,252 – 607,454 Suburbanisation into neighbouring local authorities continues.

1981 492,164 – 503,726 1991 448,629 – 480,196 2001 439,428 – 439,476 Liverpool's population steadily increased again, partly attributed to a rise in students, student accommodation, young professionals, and increased job opportunities through urban regeneration .

2011 466,415 2021 486,100 The city The city of Liverpool is at the core of a much larger and more populous metropolitan area ; however, at the most recent UK Census in 2021 , the area governed by Liverpool City Council had a population of 486,100, a 4.2% increase from the previous Census in 2011 . This figure increased to 500,500 people by 2022, according to data from Liverpool City Council.

Taking in to account how local government is organised within the cities and metropolitan areas of England, the Liverpool was the fifth largest of England's 'core cities' and had the second-overall-highest population density of those, by 2021.

[ 199 ] [ 200 ] The population of the city has steadily risen since the 2001 Census . As well as having a growing population, the population density also grew at the 2021 Census compared to the previous census. Since 2011, its population size ranked 10th out of 309 local authority areas.

[ 201 ] The population of the city is comparatively younger than that of England as a whole. Family life in the city is also growing at odds with the North West England region as a whole: At the 2021 Census, the percentage of households including a couple without children increased in Liverpool, but fell across the North West. The percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed also increased in Liverpool compared to the overall North West region where it fell.

Liverpool's ethnic and international population is growing. More people in the city identified as Asian and Black in the most recent census , compared to the previous census.

The 2021 Census also showed that Liverpool's ethnic and international population was growing. The number of residents in the city born outside of England has increased since the previous census, while the number of residents who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK has also increased at a faster rate than England as a whole. The overall share of the city's population who identified as Asian and Black increased, while the percentage who identified as white decreased in the city compared with previous Census.

[ 202 ] It has been argued that the city can claim to have one of the strongest Irish heritages in the United Kingdom, with as many as 75 per cent (estimated) of Liverpool's population with some form of Irish ancestry .

[ 203 ] The growing population of Liverpool in the 21st century reverses a trend which took place between the 1930s and 2001, when the population of the city proper effectively halved.

At the 1931 United Kingdom census , Liverpool's population reached an all-time high of 846,302. Following this peak, in response to central government policy, the Council authority of Liverpool then built and owned large several 'new town' council estates in the suburbs within Liverpool's metropolitan area. Tens of thousands of people were systematically relocated to new housing in areas such as Halton , Knowsley , St Helens , Sefton , Wirral , Cheshire West and Chester , West Lancashire , Warrington and as far as North Wales .

Such a mass relocation and population loss during this time was common practice for many British cities, including London and Manchester , In contrast, satellite towns such as Kirkby , Skelmersdale and Runcorn saw a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s).

[ 204 ] [ 205 ] [ 202 ] [ 206 ] Urban and metropolitan area Liverpool is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside (plus Halton ) area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Sometimes, this metropolitan area is broadened to encompass urban settlements in the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Cheshire .

[ 207 ] [ 208 ] The Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom uses the international standardised International Territorial Levels (ITLs) to divide up the economic territory of the UK . This enables the ONS to calculate regional and local statistics and data. The ONS uses a series of codes to identify these areas. In order of hierarchy from largest area to smallest area, Liverpool is part of the following regions: [ 209 ] [ 210 ] [ 211 ] ITL 1 region North West England (code TLD) At the 2021 Census, the ITL 1 region of North West England had a usual resident population of 7,417,300.

[ 212 ] ITL 2 region Merseyside (code TLD7) The ITL 2 region of Merseyside is defined as the area comprising East Merseyside (TLD71) plus Liverpool (TLD72), Sefton (TLD73) and Wirral (TLD74).

At the 2021 Census, the population of this area was as follows: [ 213 ] East Merseyside (TLD71): Halton = 128,200 Knowsley = 154,500 St. Helens = 183,200 Liverpool (TLD72) = 486,100 Sefton (TLD73) = 279,300 Wirral (TLD74) = 320,200 Therefore, the total population of the ITL 2 Merseyside region was 1,551,500 based on the 2021 Census.

ITL 3 region The smallest ITL 3 area classed as Liverpool (code TLD72), therefore, had a population of 486,100 at the 2021 Census.

Other definitions At the 2021 Census, the ONS used a refreshed concept of built-up areas (BUAs) based on the physical built environment, using satellite imagery to recognise developed land, such as cities, towns and villages. This allows the ONS to investigate economic and social statistics based on actual settlements where most people live. Data from the 2021 Census is not directly comparable with 2011 Census data due to this revised methodology. Using the population figures of BUAs at the 2021 Census (excluding London), Liverpool Built-up Area is the third largest in England with some 506,565 usual residents (behind only Birmingham and Leeds ). Liverpool's built-up area is, therefore, larger than the major English cities of Bristol , Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne , Nottingham and Sheffield .

[ 214 ] Map showing the six boroughs of Liverpool City Region : the fourth-largest combined authority area in England.

Excluding London, the Liverpool City Region was the fourth-largest combined authority area in England, by 2021. The population is approximately 1.6 million. The Liverpool City Region is a political and economic partnership between local authorities including Liverpool , plus the Metropolitan boroughs of Knowsley , Sefton , St Helens , Wirral and the Borough of Halton . The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority exercises strategic governance powers for the region in many areas. The economic data of the Liverpool city region is of particular policy interest to the Office for National Statistics , particularly as the British Government continuously explores the potential to negotiate increased devolved powers for each combined authority area.

[ 215 ] [ 216 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] A 2011 report, Liverpool City Region – Building on its Strengths , by Lord Heseltine and Terry Leahy , stated that "what is now called Liverpool City Region has a population of around 1.5 million", but also referred to "an urban region that spreads from Wrexham and Flintshire to Chester , Warrington , West Lancashire and across to Southport ", with a population of 2.3 million.

[ 219 ] In 2006, in an attempt to harmonise the series of metropolitan areas across the European Union, ESPON (now European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion ) released a study defining a " Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area " with an estimated population of 2.241 million people. The metro area comprised a functional urban area consisting of a contiguous urban sprawl, labour pool, and commuter Travel to work areas . The analysis defined this metropolitan area as Liverpool itself, combined with the surrounding areas of Birkenhead , Wigan / Ashton , Warrington , Widnes / Runcorn , Chester , Southport , Ellesmere Port , Ormskirk and Skelmersdale .

[ 220 ] Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area, [ 221 ] [ 222 ] [ 223 ] or megalopolis .

Ethnicity In recent decades, Liverpool's population is becoming more multicultural. According to the 2021 census, 77% of all Liverpool residents described their ethnic group as White English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British. The remaining 23% were described as non-White English/British. Between 2011 and 2021, there was population growth across all ethnic groups, except 'White English/British' and 'Any Other', where there were overall losses. The number of 'Other White residents' in Liverpool also increased by almost 12,000 people, with notable increases in the 'Other Asian', 'Arab', and 'Other Mixed/Multiple' population categories. The non-White English/British population as a percentage of the total population across the 'newly organised city electoral wards' ranged from 5% in the Orrell Park ward to 69% in the Princes Park ward. Nine out of ten Liverpool residents regarded English as their main language. The most spoken non-English languages in the city were Arabic (5,743 main speakers) followed by Polish (4,809 main speakers). Overall, almost 45,000 residents had a main language that was not English.

Murphy – 6,495 Liverpool is home to the UK's oldest black community , dating back to at least the 1730s. Some Liverpudlians can trace their black ancestry in the city back ten generations.

[ 228 ] Early Black settlers in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, and freed slaves , since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed free men.

[ 229 ] Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its large African-Caribbean , [ 4 ] Ghanaian , [ 230 ] and Somali [ 231 ] communities, formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent generations.

Liverpool has the oldest Chinese community in Europe and the largest Chinese arch outside China.

The city is also home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; the first residents of the city's Chinatown arrived as seamen in the 19th century.

[ 232 ] The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool's Chinatown is the largest such gateway outside China. Liverpool also has a long-standing Filipino community.

Lita Roza , a singer from Liverpool who was the first woman to achieve a UK number one hit, had Filipino ancestry.

The city is also known for its large Irish and Welsh populations.

[ 233 ] In 1813, 10 per cent of Liverpool's population was Welsh, leading to the city becoming known as "the capital of North Wales ." [ 233 ] During, and in the decades following, the Great Irish Famine in the mid-19th century, up to two million Irish people travelled to Liverpool within one decade, with many subsequently departing for the United States.

[ 234 ] By 1851, more than 20 per cent of the population of Liverpool was Irish.

[ 235 ] At the 2001 Census, 1.17 per cent of the population were Welsh-born and 0.75 per cent were born in the Republic of Ireland , while 0.54 per cent were born in Northern Ireland , [ 236 ] but many more Liverpudlians are of legacy Welsh or Irish ancestry.

[ 237 ] Other contemporary ethnicities include Indian , [ 4 ] Latin American , [ 238 ] Malaysian , [ 239 ] and Yemeni [ 240 ] communities, which number several thousand each.

This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings, [ 242 ] including two Christian cathedrals.

Liverpool is known to be England's 'most Catholic city', with a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England.

[ 243 ] This is mainly due to high historic Irish migration to the city and their descendants since.

[ 244 ] The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican Our Lady and St Nicholas , colloquially known as "the sailors church", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses . Other notable churches include the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas (built in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style) and the Gustav Adolf Church (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles).

Liverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The Anglican Cathedral , which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual Liverpool Shakespeare Festival , has one of the longest naves , largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral , on Mount Pleasant next to Liverpool Science Park , was initially planned to be even larger. Of Sir Edwin Lutyens 's original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by Sir Frederick Gibberd . While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design, it still incorporates the largest panel of stained glass in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called Hope Street . The cathedral has long been colloquially referred to as "Paddy's Wigwam" due to its shape.

[ 245 ] Liverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed Moorish Revival Princes Road Synagogue is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain's Moorish Revival synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool.

[ 246 ] Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant Jewish community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the Greenbank Park area of L17 has recently closed and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also a Lubavitch Chabad House and a reform synagogue . Liverpool has had a Jewish community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool is around 5,000.

[ 247 ] The Liverpool Talmudical College existed from 1914 until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue .

[ citation needed ] Liverpool also has a Hindu community, with a Mandir on Edge Lane , Edge Hill . The Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool is located there.

[ 248 ] Liverpool also has the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Wavertree [ 249 ] and a Baháʼí Centre in the same area.

[ 250 ] The city had the earliest Mosque in England and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by William Abdullah Quilliam , a lawyer who had converted to Islam who set up the Liverpool Muslim Institute in a terraced house on West Derby Road.

[ 251 ] Apart from the first mosque in England which now houses a museum, [ 252 ] [ 253 ] the largest and main one, Al-Rahma mosque , was also the third purpose-built mosque in the United Kingdom.

[ 254 ] The second largest mosque in Liverpool is the Masjid Al-Taiseer.

[ 255 ] Other mosques in the city include the Bait ul Lateef Ahmadiyya Mosque, [ 256 ] Hamza Center (Community Center), [ 257 ] Islamic community centre, [ 258 ] Liverpool Mosque and Islamic Institute, [ 259 ] Liverpool Towhid Centre, [ 260 ] Masjid Annour, [ 261 ] and the Shah Jalal Mosque.

The city is also a major contributor to the economy of Liverpool City Region , worth over £40 billion per year.

[ 266 ] [ 267 ] [ 268 ] The local authority area governed by Liverpool City Council accounts for 39% of the Liverpool city region's total jobs, 40% of its total GVA and 35% of its total businesses. At the local authority level, the city's GVA (balanced) at current basic prices was £14.3 billion in 2021. Its GDP at current market prices was £15.9 billion. This equates to £32,841 per head of the population.

[ 269 ] [ 270 ] At the 2021 United Kingdom census , 51.1% of Liverpool's population aged 16 years and over was classed as employed, 44.2% economically inactive and 4.8% unemployed. Of those employed, the most popular industries providing the employment were human health and social work activities (18.7%), wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles (15%), education (10.8%), public administration and defence; compulsory social security (7.3%), accommodation and food service activities (6.8%), construction (6.5%), transport and storage (5.8%), manufacturing (5.5%) and professional, scientific and technical activities (5.2%).

[ 271 ] According to the ONS Business Register and Employment Survey 2021, some industries within Liverpool perform strongly compared to other local authorities in Great Britain . In terms of absolute number of jobs per industry in Great Britain's local authority areas, Liverpool features in the national top 10 for human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; public administration and defence; compulsory social security; accommodation and food service activities and real estate activities. Liverpool features in the national top 20 for number of jobs in education; construction; wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; transportation and storage; financial and insurance activities and professional, scientific and technical activities.

[ 272 ] In 2023, Liverpool City Council set out an economic growth plan for the city over the following 20 years. The City Council will have particular focus on economic sectors such as the visitor economy (tourism) , culture , life sciences , digital and creative sectors , and advanced car manufacturing .

[ 273 ] According to the International passenger Survey, from the ONS , Liverpool was one of the top 5 most visited cities in the UK by overseas tourists in 2022. As of the same year, the city's tourist industry was worth a total of £3.5 billion annually and was part of a larger city region tourist industry worth £5 billion. A consistent calendar of major events, as well as a plethora of cultural attractions, continue to provide a significant draw for tourists. Tourism related to the Beatles is worth an estimated £100 million to the Liverpool economy each year alone.

Liverpool One , as well as a growing retail offer overall, has led to the city being one of the most prominent destinations for shopping in the UK.

Liverpool Cruise Terminal , which is situated close to the Pier Head , enables tourists to berth in the centre of the city.

[ 274 ] [ 275 ] [ 276 ] [ 277 ] [ 278 ] [ 279 ] [ 280 ] Liverpool is home to the Knowledge Quarter , a 450-acre city centre district that hosts some of the world's most influential institutions in science, health, technology, education, music and the creative performing arts. The UK government has also identified the city as a ' pharmaceutical production superpower' and one of the UK's leading regions for bioprocessing . The accolade led to the government choosing the city for England's second ever 'Investment Zone' in 2023. This will involve millions of pounds being invested over the coming years in to science orientated districts including the Knowledge Quarter and the so-called 'pharma cluster' in the city suburb of Speke . The two clusters form an internationally significant role in infectious disease control. Liverpool City Council also plan to invest in the city's Baltic Triangle , which is renowned in the creative and digital industries.

[ 281 ] [ 282 ] [ 283 ] [ 284 ] [ 285 ] [ 286 ] Car manufacturing also takes place in the city at the Jaguar Land Rover Halewood plant, where the Range Rover Evoque model is assembled. In 2023, Jaguar Land Rover announced that the Halewood plant would begin to shift its focus to electric car production.

[ 287 ] [ 288 ] Historically, the economy of Liverpool was centred on the city's port and manufacturing base. Today, the Port of Liverpool is the UK's fourth-largest port by tonnage of freight , handling over 30 million tonnes in 2020. The city is also the UK's largest port for transatlantic trade , handling 45% of the country's trade from the United States. In 2023, the city was chosen by the British government to be a designated Freeport to encourage growing international commerce.

The Liverpool2 container terminal, completed in 2022, has greatly increased the volume of cargo which Liverpool is able to handle and has facilitated the world's biggest container vessels .

[ 289 ] [ 290 ] [ 291 ] [ 292 ] [ 293 ] [ 294 ] [ 295 ] Liverpool is also home to numerous UK headquarters, or the major strategic branch offices, of many shipping and freight lines including: Atlantic Container Line , [ 296 ] Bibby Line , [ 297 ] Borchard Lines Ltd, [ 298 ] CMA CGM , [ 299 ] Hapag-Lloyd , [ 300 ] Independent Container Line, [ 301 ] Irish Ferries , [ 302 ] Maersk Line , [ 303 ] Mediterranean Shipping Company [ 304 ] and Zim Integrated Shipping Services .

[ 305 ] Liverpool's rich architectural base has helped the city become the second most filmed city in the UK outside London. As well as being a featured location in its own right, it often doubles up for Chicago, London, Moscow, New York City, Paris and Rome . The Depot studios, close to the city centre, provide space for film and TV productions.

[ 306 ] [ 307 ] Major economic projects planned for the city include the revitalisation of disused land in the North docks/Ten Streets area, Liverpool Waters and a new purpose-built TV studio at the former Littlewoods Pools building , adjacent to the Depot.

[ 308 ] [ 309 ] [ 310 ] City region economy and devolution The Liverpool City Region GDP in 2021 was £40.479 billion. The six contributing boroughs to this GDP were as follows: [ 311 ] Liverpool (£15.911 billion) (39.3%) Wirral (£6.632 billion) (16.4%) Sefton (£5.431 billion) (13.4%) Knowsley (£4.557 billion) (11.3%) Halton (£4.498 billion) (11.1%) St Helens (£3.448 billion) (8.52%) The policy agenda of the British Government is to continuously monitor the economy and productivity of the UK's core cities within the context of their respective city regions . The government's longer-term plan is to assess each area's potential for increased devolution and transfer of additional powers and budgets from central government in Whitehall to their corresponding combined authorities . As such, official statistics about Liverpool's economy within the context of the Liverpool City Region , are closely monitored by the Office for National Statistics . This allows policy and decision makers to more accurately assess the 'functional economic area' of the city, which is not bound by traditional local government geographies .

[ 312 ] [ 313 ] [ 314 ] [ 315 ] [ 316 ] As of 2023, there are ten city regions in England with combined authorities. The economy of Liverpool's combined authority area in comparison to the other city regions is as follows: Economy of Liverpool City Region compared to all combined authority areas in England [ 317 ] Combined authority area Core city (if applicable) GVA (2021) (£ billions) GDP (2021) (£ billions) GDP per head (2021) (£) Cambridgeshire and Peterborough 28.648 31.698 35,348 Greater Manchester Manchester 78.744 87.703 30,576 Liverpool City Region Liverpool 35.345 40.479 26,086 North East 22.516 26.255 23,038 North of Tyne Newcastle upon Tyne 19.725 22.444 27,075 South Yorkshire Sheffield 28.971 33.528 24,399 Tees Valley 14.241 16.346 24,103 West Midlands Birmingham 70.961 79.076 27,117 West of England Bristol 34.110 37.571 39,371 West Yorkshire Leeds 60.137 67.607 28,769 Landmarks Main articles: Architecture of Liverpool and Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City See also: List of tallest buildings and structures in Liverpool and List of public art in Liverpool Liverpool's Three Graces, the Royal Liver Building , Cunard Building and Port of Liverpool Building at the Pier Head Liverpool's long commercial history has given rise to a considerable variety of architectural styles found within the city, ranging from 16th-century Tudor buildings to modern-day contemporary architecture .

[ 318 ] The majority of buildings in the city date from the late 18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the British Empire .

[ 319 ] There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed [ 320 ] and 85 are Grade II* listed.

[ 321 ] The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster and significant number of Georgian houses still exist.

[ 322 ] [ 323 ] This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by English Heritage , as England's finest Victorian city.

[ 324 ] The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City , the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of international trade and docking technology.

[ 325 ] However, this status was revoked in July 2021, when UNESCO resolved that recent and proposed developments, such as the Bramley-Moore Dock Stadium and Liverpool Waters projects, had resulted in the "serious deterioration" of the area's significance.

[ 326 ] Waterfront and docks The Liverpool Waterfront with the Port of Liverpool Building , Museum of Liverpool , Royal Albert Dock and Wheel of Liverpool all visible Modern office and commercial developments on the Liverpool Waterfront As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed wet dock (the Old Dock ) in 1715 and the first ever hydraulic lifting cranes .

[ 327 ] The best-known dock in Liverpool is the Royal Albert Dock , which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain.

[ 328 ] Built under the guidance of Jesse Hartley , it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. Today, the Royal Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the Merseyside Maritime Museum , International Slavery Museum , Tate Liverpool and The Beatles Story . North of the city centre is Stanley Dock , home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse , which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area [ 329 ] and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.

[ 330 ] One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the Pier Head , renowned for the trio of buildings—the Royal Liver Building , the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building —which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the Three Graces , these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Built in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of 'maritime Liverpool' and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.

[ 331 ] [ 332 ] [ 333 ] [ 334 ] In the 21st century, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Among the notable developments are the Museum of Liverpool , the construction of the Liverpool Arena , ACC Liverpool and Exhibition Centre Liverpool on King's Dock , Alexandra Tower and 1 Princes Dock on Prince's Dock and Liverpool Marina around Coburg and Brunswick Docks .

The Wheel of Liverpool opened on 25 March 2010.

[ 335 ] [ 336 ] However, plans to redevelop parts of Liverpool city centre have been marred by controversy . In December 2016, a newly formed company called North Point Global Ltd.

was given the rights to develop part of the docks under the "New Chinatown" working name. Though heavily advertised in Liverpool, Hong Kong and Chinese cities with high-profile advertisements and videos, the "New Chinatown" development failed to materialise.

[ 337 ] In January 2018, the Liverpool Echo and Asia Times revealed that the site remained sans any construction. North Point Global as well as its subcontractor "Bilt" had both declared bankruptcy, and the small investors (mostly middle class couples) who had already paid money for the apartments had lost most of their savings in them.

[ 338 ] Commercial district and cultural quarter St George's Hall Municipal Buildings Liverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'.

[ 339 ] The commercial district is centred on the Castle Street , Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their medieval layout. Having developed predominantly over a period of three centuries, the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's former World Heritage site .

[ 340 ] The oldest building in the area is the Grade I listed Liverpool Town Hall , which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of Georgian architecture , the building is known as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain.

[ 341 ] [ 342 ] Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed Bank of England Building , constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank .

[ 341 ] Among the other buildings in the area are the Tower Buildings , Albion House (the former White Star Line headquarters), the Municipal Buildings and Oriel Chambers , [ 343 ] which is considered to be one of the earliest Modernist style buildings ever built.

[ 344 ] The area around William Brown Street is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the William Brown Library , Walker Art Gallery , Picton Reading Rooms and World Museum Liverpool . The area is dominated by neo-classical architecture , of which the most prominent, St George's Hall , [ 345 ] is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe.

[ 346 ] A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with " S.P.Q.L.

" (Latin senatus populusque Liverpudliensis ), meaning "the senate and people of Liverpool". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including Wellington's Column and the Steble Fountain . Many others are located around the area, particularly in St John's Gardens , which was specifically developed for this purpose.

[ 347 ] The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the Roman Forum .

[ 348 ] Other notable landmarks Speke Hall Tudor manor house is one of Liverpool's oldest buildings.

Liverpool Cathedral , the largest cathedral in the UK Sefton Park Palm House While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall , a Tudor manor house located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598.

[ 349 ] The building is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interiors, which were added in the mid-19th century.

[ 350 ] In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall , which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.

[ 351 ] The oldest building within the city centre is the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers , [ 352 ] which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style architecture , [ 353 ] [ 354 ] the building was influenced in part by the work of Christopher Wren [ 355 ] and was originally the home of the Bluecoat School (who later moved to a larger site in Wavertree in the south of the city). Since 1908, it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool.

[ 353 ] Liverpool is noted for having two cathedrals, each of which imposes over the landscape around it.

[ 356 ] The Anglican Cathedral , which was constructed between 1904 and 1978, is the largest cathedral in Britain [ 357 ] and the fifth largest in the world . Designed and built in Gothic style , it is regarded as one of the greatest buildings to have been constructed during the 20th century [ 358 ] and was described by former British Poet Laureate , John Betjeman , as "one of the great buildings of the world".

[ 359 ] The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral was constructed between 1962 and 1967 and is known as one of the first cathedrals to break the traditional longitudinal design.

[ 360 ] In the 21st century, many parts of Liverpool's city centre have undergone significant redevelopment and regeneration after years of decline. So far, the largest of these developments has been Liverpool One , which saw almost £1 billion invested in the redevelopment of 42 acres (17 hectares) of land, providing new retail, commercial, residential and leisure space.

[ 361 ] Around the north of the city centre, several new skyscrapers have also been constructed including the RIBA award-winning Unity Buildings and West Tower , which at 140m is Liverpool's tallest building . Many redevelopment schemes are also in progress including Circus, [ 362 ] King's Dock , [ 363 ] Paddington Village [ 364 ] and Liverpool Waters .

[ 365 ] There are many other notable buildings in Liverpool, including the art deco former terminal building of Speke Airport , the University of Liverpool 's Victoria Building , (which provided the inspiration for the term Red Brick University ), and the Adelphi Hotel , which was in the past considered to be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world.

[ 366 ] Parks and gardens The Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England describes Merseyside 's Victorian Parks as collectively the "most important in the country".

[ 367 ] Liverpool has ten listed parks and cemeteries, including two Grade I and five Grade II*, more than any other English city apart from London.

[ 368 ] Transport Main article: Transport in Liverpool Further information: Liverpool city centre § Transport Liverpool has an extensive transport infrastructure that connects the city with its metropolitan area, the rest of the United Kingdom , Europe and the world. Various modes of transport provide considerable connections by road, rail, air and sea. The local network of buses, trains and ferries is managed by Merseytravel on behalf of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region . The Mayor and Combined Authority have control of a devolved transport budget and associated transport powers for this local system. The city's major port and international airport provide global links for both passengers and freight.

[ 371 ] To the east, the M62 runs across the north of England, ultimately connecting Liverpool with Hull on the opposite coast, and along the route with several large cities including Manchester , Leeds and Bradford . The M62 also provides a connection to both the M6 and M1 motorways , providing indirect links to more distant areas including Birmingham , London, Nottingham , Preston and Sheffield .

[ 372 ] [ 373 ] To the east, but running north-south, the M57 acts as a 10-mile ring road for the city itself and links the M62 and M58 motorways, as well as the A580 East Lancashire Road providing a link directly to the A5300 that links to the bridges that cross the Mersey to the south of the city.

[ 374 ] To the south, Liverpool is connected to Widnes and Warrington via the A562 and A5300 and across the River Mersey to Runcorn in Cheshire , via the Silver Jubilee and Mersey Gateway bridges. The M56 motorway then provides routes into parts of the neighbouring counties, with connections to the Wirral and North Wales, and a direct route to Manchester Airport .

The network provides approximately 30 million passenger journeys per year, across a system of 69 stations throughout Liverpool's metropolitan area, within the formal boundaries of the Liverpool city region and adjacent areas of Cheshire and Lancashire .

[ 420 ] [ 421 ] [ 422 ] [ 423 ] The network consists of three lines: the Northern Line , which runs to Southport , Ormskirk , Headbolt Lane and Hunts Cross ; the Wirral Line , which runs through the Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to New Brighton , West Kirby , Chester and Ellesmere Port ; and the City Line , which begins at Lime Street , providing links to St Helens , Wigan , Preston , Warrington and Manchester .

[ 424 ] [ 425 ] The network is predominantly electric and covers 75 miles (120 kilometres) of track.

[ 426 ] [ 427 ] Trains are owned and operated by the Merseyrail franchise and managed by Merseytravel under the direction of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority . Local services on the City Line are operated by Northern rather than Merseyrail, although the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within Liverpool city centre , four stations and over 6 + 1 ⁄ 2 miles (10.5 kilometres) of tunnels are underground.

[ 426 ] Hamilton Square and Liverpool James Street are the oldest deep level underground stations in the world.

[ 428 ] In 2023, for the first time in UK history, battery-powered passenger trains launched on Merseyrail tracks from the newly opened Headbolt Lane station in Kirkby. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority's long term "Merseyrail for All" plan is to reduce dependency on live third rail and promote battery power in order to further expand Merseyrail to previously inaccessible places across the city region and as far as Manchester , Wrexham , Warrington and Preston .

"Lyrpole, alias Lyverpoole, a pavid towne, hath but a chapel ... The king hath a castelet there, and the Earl of Darbe hath a stone howse there. Irisch merchants cum much thither, as to a good haven ... At Lyrpole is smaul custom payed, that causith marchantes to resorte thither. Good marchandis at Lyrpole, and much Irish yarrn that Manchester men do buy there ..." – John Leland , Itinerary , c.

1536 –1539 [ 518 ] "Liverpoole is one of the wonders of Britain ... In a word, there is no town in England, London excepted, that can equal [it] for the fineness of the streets, and the beauty of the buildings." – Daniel Defoe , A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain , 1721–1726 "[O]ne of the neatest, best towns I have seen in England." – John Wesley .

Journal , 1755 "I have not come here to be insulted by a set of wretches, every brick in whose infernal town is cemented with an African's blood." – George Frederick Cooke (1756–1812), an actor responding to being hissed at when he came onstage drunk during a visit to Liverpool [ 519 ] "That immense City which stands like another Venice upon the water ... where there are riches overflowing and every thing which can delight a man who wishes to see the prosperity of a great community and a great empire ... This quondam village, now fit to be the proud capital of any empire in the world, has started up like an enchanted palace even in the memory of living men." – Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine , 1791 "I have heard of the greatness of Liverpool, but the reality far surpasses my expectation." – Prince Albert , speech, 1846 "Liverpool ... has become a wonder of the world. It is the New York of Europe, a world city rather than merely British provincial." – Illustrated London News , 15 May 1886 "The dream represented my situation at the time. I can still see the greyish-yellow raincoats, glistening with the wetness of the rain. Everything was extremely unpleasant, black and opaque—just as I felt then. But I had a vision of unearthly beauty, and that is why I was able to live at all. Liverpool is the "pool of life." The "liver," according to an old view, is the seat of life, that which makes to live." – C. G. Jung , Memories, Dreams, Reflections , 1928 "The centre is imposing, dignified and darkish, like a city in a rather gloomy Victorian novel ... We had now arrived in the heart of the big city, and as usual it was almost a heart of darkness. But it looked like a big city, there was no denying that. Here, emphatically, was the English seaport second only to London. The very weight of stone emphasised that fact. And even if the sun never seems to properly rise over it, I like a big city to proclaim itself a big city at once..." – J. B. Priestley , English Journey , 1934 "If Liverpool can get into top gear again, there is no limit to the city's potential. The scale and resilience of the buildings and people is amazing—it is a world city, far more so than London and Manchester. It doesn't feel like anywhere else in Lancashire: comparisons always end up overseas— Dublin , or Boston , or Hamburg . The city is tremendous, and so, right up to the First World War , were the abilities of the architects who built over it. The centre is humane and convenient to walk around in, but never loses its scale. And, in spite of the bombings and the carelessness, it is still full of superb buildings. Fifty years ago it must have outdone anything in England." – Ian Nairn , Britain's Changing Towns , 1967 International links Twin cities Liverpool is twinned [ 520 ] with: Surabaya , Indonesia (2017) Birmingham, Alabama , United States (2015) Cologne , Germany (1952) Dublin , Ireland (1997) Johor Bahru , Malaysia Medan , Indonesia Odesa , Odesa Oblast , Ukraine Penang , Malaysia Rio de Janeiro , Brazil (2003) Shanghai , China (1999) Friendship links Liverpool has friendship links (without formal constitution) [ 521 ] with the following cities: Givenchy-lès-la-Bassée , Pas-de-Calais, France Halifax , Nova Scotia, Canada Havana , La Habana , Cuba La Plata , Buenos Aires Province, Argentina Memphis , Tennessee, US Minamitane , Kagoshima Prefecture , Japan Naples , Campania, Italy New Orleans , Louisiana, US Ponsacco , Tuscany, Italy Râmnicu Vâlcea , Vâlcea County , Romania Valparaíso , Valparaíso Province , Chile Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico Consulates The first overseas consulate of the United States was opened in Liverpool in 1790, and it remained operational for almost two centuries.
