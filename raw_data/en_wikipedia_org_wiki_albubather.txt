De nativitatibus , 1501 He wrote in Persian and Arabic and is best known for his work De nativitatibus which was translated into Latin by Canonicus Salio in Padua 1218, and was also translated into Hebrew. The first printed edition appeared in Venice in 1492, edited by Antonio Lauro, a Venetian prelate. It contains detailed descriptions of the influence of the planets, sun, moon and zodiac on a child throughout the gestation period, from physical characteristics to musical ability.
