Fauna [ edit ] Mammals [ edit ] Main article: List of mammals of Guinea-Bissau Predators [ edit ] There still is much debate about the status of many predator species in Guinea-Bissau. This is, in part, because much of the country remains unstudied, and because of the cryptic nature of many predator species. The lion, for instance, was listed as possibly extinct in Guinea-Bissau during the 2014 assessment of the lion by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species .

[ 1 ] However, a picture of a lion was still recorded by a camera trap in 2016 the southeastern Boé region .
