The field of geology encompasses the composition, structure, physical properties, and history of Earth's components, and the processes by which it is shaped. Geologists typically study rock , sediment , soil , rivers , and natural resources .

Branches of geology [ edit ] Geology applies primarily to Earth, but can be applied to any planet or extraterrestrial body.

Geology of Earth [ edit ] Subdisciplines of geology: Biogeology – Study of the interactions between the Earth's biosphere and the lithosphere Economic geology – Science concerned with earth materials of economic value Engineering geology – Application of geology to engineering practice Environmental geology – Application of geology to environmental problems Geochemistry – Science that applies chemistry to analyze geological systems Geologic modelling – Applied science of creating computerized representations of portions of the Earth's crust Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets Geomorphology – Scientific study of landforms Geophysics – Physics of the Earth and its vicinity Historical geology – Study of the geological history of Earth Hydrogeology – Study of groundwater's movement and distribution Marine geology – Study of the history and structure of the ocean floor Mineralogy – Scientific study of minerals and mineralised artifacts Mining geology – Extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth Paleontology – Study of past life through fossils Petroleum geology – Study of the origin, occurrence, movement, accumulation, and exploration of hydrocarbon fuels Petrology – Branch of geology that studies the formation, composition, distribution and structure of rocks Sedimentology – Study of natural sediments and their formation processes Stratigraphy – Study of rock layers and their formation Structural geology – Science of the description and interpretation of deformation in the Earth's crust Volcanology – Study of volcanoes Planetary geology [ edit ] See also: Geology of solar terrestrial planets – Geology of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and Ceres Planetary geology – Geological study of planets

Eighth planet from the Sun Geology of Triton – Geologic structure and composition of Triton Geology of Pluto – Geologic structure and composition of Pluto Geology of Charon – Geologic structure and composition of Charon Principles of geology [ edit ] Principle of cross-cutting relationships – Principle that the geologic feature which cuts another is the younger of the two Law of included fragments – Clasts in a rock are older than the rock formation Principle of uniformitarianism – Assumption that natural laws are constant through time and space Principle of original horizontality – Layers of sediment are deposited approximately horizontally under the action of gravity Principle of superposition – Law stating that newer strata stack above older ones Principle of faunal succession – Concept in geology Geological processes [ edit ] Petrogenesis – Processes that form rock History of geology [ edit ] History of geology Geological history of Earth Timeline of geology – Chronological list of notable events in the history of the science of geology Geologic provinces [ edit ] World geologic provinces Oceanic crust 0–20 Ma 20–65 Ma >65 Ma Geologic provinces Shield Platform Orogen Basin Large igneous province Extended crust Geologic province – Spatial entity with common geologic attributes Geologic provinces based on origin: Shield – Large stable area of exposed Precambrian crystalline rock Platform – Continental area covered by relatively flat or gently tilted, mainly sedimentary strata Orogen – Zone affected by mountain formation Pages displaying short

continental margin Forearc – Region between an oceanic trench and associated volcanic arc Oceanic basin – Geologic basin under the sea Cratonic basin – Old and stable part of the continental lithosphere Foreland basin , also known as foredeep basin – Structural basin that develops adjacent and parallel to a mountain belt Large igneous province – Huge regional accumulation of igneous rocks Extended crust – Outermost solid shell of astronomical bodies Rift – Geological linear zone where the lithosphere is being pulled apart Plate tectonics [ edit ] Plate tectonics – Movement of Earth's lithosphere Occupations in geology [ edit ] The Dictionary of Occupational Titles lists the following occupations in Geology, which it describes as "concerned with the investigation of the
