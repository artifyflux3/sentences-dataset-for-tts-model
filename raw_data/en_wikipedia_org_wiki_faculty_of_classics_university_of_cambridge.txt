It teaches the Classical Tripos . The Faculty is divided into five caucuses (i.e. areas of research and teaching); literature, ancient philosophy , ancient history , Classical art and archaeology , linguistics , and interdisciplinary studies.

[ 1 ] The Faculty runs the Museum of Classical Archaeology on the first floor of the faculty building on the Sidgwick Site .  The three-storey building was built in 1968 and includes lecture and seminar rooms, offices, and a library on the ground floor. The faculty building was refurbished and extended in 2010.

Courses offered [ edit ] At undergraduate level, the faculty offers the Classical Tripos as its Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. For students who have taken Latin at A-Level this is a three-year course, [ 2 ] and for those who have not studied Latin beyond GCSE it is a four-year course.

[ 3 ] At postgraduate level, the faculty offers two degrees: Master of Philosophy (MPhil) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).

[ 4 ] It also contributes to the teaching of the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in Classics offered by the Faculty of Education .

[ 5 ] The MPhil is a nine-month taught course, which is examined by three essays and a 10,000 word thesis, or two essays, a language-exam/exercise, and the thesis.

[ 6 ] The PhD is a three-year research course, and it is examined by a doctoral thesis of up to 80,000 words. There is no formal teaching as the degree is completed through independent research. However, doctoral students may attend graduate seminars, undergraduate lectures, and can receive additional training in languages and/or specific disciplines (such as epigraphy or numismatics ).
