The principle of LSD is derived from schlieren photography : a narrow laser beam is used to scan an area in a gas where changes in properties are associated with characteristic changes of refractive index . Laser schlieren deflectometry is claimed to overcome limitations of other methods regarding temporal and spatial resolution.

[ 1 ] The theory of the method is analogous to the scattering experiment of Ernest Rutherford from 1911. However, instead of alpha particles scattered by gold atoms , here an optical ray is deflected by hot spots with unknown temperature.
A general equation of LSD describes the dependence of the measured maximum deflection of the ray δ 1 on the local maximum of the neutral gas temperature in the hot spot T 1 : T 0 T 1 + δ δ 1 δ δ 0 = 1 , {\displaystyle {\frac {T_{0}}{T_{1}}}+{\frac {\delta _{1}}{\delta _{0}}}=1,} where T 0 is ambient temperature and δ 0 is a calibration constant depending on the configuration of the experiment.

[ 2 ] Laser schlieren deflectometry has been used for investigation of the temperature dynamics, heat transfer and energy balance in a miniaturized kind of atmospheric-pressure plasma .
