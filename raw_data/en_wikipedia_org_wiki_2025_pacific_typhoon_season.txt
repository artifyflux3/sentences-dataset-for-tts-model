The season will run throughout 2025, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between June and October. The season's first named storm, Wutip , developed on June 9, the fourth-latest date for a typhoon season to produce a named storm.

[ 1 ] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100°E and the 180th meridian . Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) [ nb 2 ] will name a tropical cyclone if it has 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N–25°N, regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) [ nb 3 ] [ nb 1 ] are given a number with a "W" suffix; W meaning west, a reference to the western Pacific region.

Actual activity : JMA 22 11 4 Actual activity : JTWC 17 [ nb 4 ] 12 6 Actual activity : PAGASA 8 5 3 During the year, several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies included the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of University College London , PAGASA , Vietnam's National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting and Taiwan's Central Weather Administration .

Seasonal summary [ edit ] Early season activity [ edit ] The Pacific typhoon season began on February 11, when the JMA noted a tropical depression that formed southwest of Kalayaan, Palawan . JTWC later followed suit and began tracking it, citing unfavorable conditions for development and marginal sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of 26 °C (79 °F). As a result, JMA remained tracking the depression until it dissipated on February 15. However, the system regenerated the next day, prompting the JMA to continue tracking it until February 17.

Wutip heading to Hainan on June 12 After three months of inactivity, activity resumed when a tropical disturbance formed west of Yap on June 4. After crossing Luzon , the JMA reported that it became a tropical depression over the South China Sea on June 9. Eventually, JTWC designated it as 01W as the system continued to build up more cloud tops . It was later upgraded to a tropical storm and was given the name Wutip by the JMA on June 11, making the third latest-named storm in the Western Pacific basin. It also ended a 169-day period (December 25, 2024 – June 11, 2025) during which no named storms were active in the basin.

Wutip later emerged through favorable conditions, where it intensified into a severe tropical storm at 18:00 UTC on June 12. The following day, Wutip curved northeastward, passing over the far western part of Hainan Island, making landfall near Dongfang City at around 11:00 pm CST (19:00 UTC) that day before reemerging over the Gulf of Tonkin shortly after. On June 14, the JTWC reported that Wutip rapidly intensified into a minimal typhoon, with 1-minute sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). Wutip would go on to make its second landfall over Leizhou City in Guangdong Province at around 12:30 pm CST (04:30 UTC). After landfall, the storm weakened back to tropical storm status as satellite imagery showed that its eye had been filled in, prompting the JTWC to discontinue warnings at 09:00 UTC that day.

On June 11, another low-pressure area developed east of the Philippines . By the next day, PAGASA upgraded it into a tropical depression, assigning it the name Auring . The system tracked northward and crossed over Taiwan before weakening into a remnant low. The JMA continued to monitor Auring until it was last noted over China on June 14.

On June 21, a tropical depression formed near the Northern Mariana Islands . The following day, the JTWC designated it as 02W . By June 23, the system had strengthened into  atropical storm and was named Sepat by the JMA. However, as it neared Japan , Sepat experienced a significant decrease in convective activity, weakening back into a tropical depression before dissipating on June 26.

On June 24, the JMA reported the development of another tropical depression east of the Philippines. The JTWC later designated it as 03W on the following day. The storm moved toward southern China, making landfall along the eastern coast of the Leizhou Peninsula and dissipating inland on June 26.

[ 6 ] It caused 18 fatalities in Northern Vietnam and resulted in minimal damage.

Typhoon Danas at its peak intensity before making landfall in Budai, Chiayi County , Taiwan on July 6 On June 29, a low-pressure area developed east of southeastern Luzon. PAGASA assessed the system as having a low chance of development, but its potential gradually rose as it became more organized in the following days.  The JTWC later designated the disturbance as Invest 98W . Early on July 4, both the JTWC and JMA classified 98W as a tropical depression, with the JTWC designating it 05W . PAGASA then followed suit, naming the depression Bising . It eventually intensified into a tropical storm and was assigned the name Danas by the JMA. Tracking north-northeastward over a highly favorable environment, Danas continued to strengthen. On the following day, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm, while the JTWC classified it as a Category 1-equivalent typhoon. At 20:00 UTC that same day, the JMA upgraded Danas to a typhoon, while the JTWC reclassified it as Category 2-equivalent typhoon.

Danas later made landfall in Budai, Chiayi County , Taiwan at 23:40 local time (15:40 UTC) on July 6, becoming the first typhoon to strike the island's western coast since Typhoon Wayne in 1986. It was also the second consecutive season in which a typhoon affected that region, following Typhoon Krathon the previous year, and marked the first recorded landfall in Chiayi County . Shortly after traversing Taiwan, Danas quickly weakened, prompting the JMA to downgrade it to a severe tropical storm. The storm continued losing strength and was further downgraded to a tropical storm before making two additional landfalls: first in Dongtou District , Wenzhou , and then in Rui'an on July 8. It then moved inland, weakening into remnant low before eventually dissipating.

On June 30, a disturbance associated with a monsoon trough developed east of the Northern Mariana Islands . Benefiting from favorable conditions, it quickly organized into a tropical depression, with the JTWC designating it as 04W at 18:00 UTC on July 1. The JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm twelve hours later, though the JMA put off doing so. On the following day, the JMA also classified the system as a tropical storm, assigning it the name Mun . As it tracked northeastward east-southeast of Yokohama , Mun was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA on July 6. It subsequently weakened over cooler waters and was downgraded to a tropical depression, prompting the JTWC to issue its final advisory on July 8.

A few days after Danas weakened into a remnant low, a new tropical disturbance formed west of Iwo Jima on July 9 in a favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis . The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) the next day and designated the system as 06W on July 11. While the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm shortly thereafter, the system remained unnamed until July 12, when the JMA also upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Nari on the following day. Satellite imagery showed that Nari was partly obscured, with deep convection developing to the east of the storm's center. On July 13, Nari was upgraded to a severe tropical storm as it continued to strengthen. However, subsequent satellite images revealed shallowing cloud bands spiraling around the center, and its deep convection collapsed due to cooler sea surface temperatures near the edge of the Kuroshio Current . Nari transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on July 15 as it tracked east-northeastward toward Hokkaidō . At 02:00 that day, it made landfall near Cape Erimo at the southern tip of the island, marking the first tropical cyclone landfall in the prefecture since Tropical Storm Conson in 2016, and the first on record to do so in July since 1951. The storm dissipated later that day, prompting the JTWC to issue its final advisory.

On the same day Nari formed, the JTWC identified another area of low pressure approximately 328 km east of Shanghai . Situated in a marginal environment, the system exhibited subtropical characteristics, prompting the JTWC to classify it as a subtropical depression. The JMA, however, identified it as a tropical depression. On July 13, the JTWC designated the system as 07W as it tracked east-northeastward while retaining its subtropical nature. The system maintained its intensity before making landfall over Kyūshū , in western Japan.

Three systems active on July 24: Typhoon Co-may [Emong] (far left); Tropical Storm Francisco [Dante] (upper right); and Tropical Storm Krosa (lower right).

On July 16, a low-pressure area developed east of southeastern Luzon and was designated as Invest 96W by the JTWC. At 08:00 PHT (00:00 UTC), PAGASA named the disturbance Crising as it moved within the PAR. Due to its broad circulation, the system was classified as a monsoon depression that same day. The following day, the JTWC issued a TCFA, indicating that Crising could develop into a tropical cyclone at any moment. On July 18, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm and named it Wipha , while the JTWC maintained it as a monsoon depression. Wipha moved northwestward, passing close to Santa Ana, Cagayan , and then skirted the coastal waters of Calayan, Cagayan as it traversed the Babuyan Islands .  On July 19, the JTWC followed suit, upgrading Wipha to a tropical storm with the designation 09W . As it entered the South China Sea, it intensified into a severe tropical storm.

Wipha was later upgraded to a minimal typhoon by the JTWC as it approached southern China. Due to its proximity near Hong Kong , the Hong Kong Observatory issued Hurricane Signal No. 10 at 09:20 HKT (01:20 UTC) on July 20, the first such issuance since Typhoon Saola in 2023. The storm passed near Hong Kong and Macau , bringing torrential rains and strong winds across both territories. Wipha made landfall over Taishan, Guangdong Province in China at around 17:50 CST (09:50 UTC). The following day, the JTWC downgraded the system to a tropical storm as it slowed over Beihai before moving into the Gulf of Tonkin . On July 22, Wipha made a second landfall in Northern Vietnam between Hưng Yên and Ninh Bình . As it moved inland, the storm's tropical characteristics quickly diminished, and it weakened into a tropical depression before dissipating the next day.

Following Wipha's landfall in Vietnam , on July 21, a low-pressure area formed south-southwest of Kadena Air Base and was designated Invest 97W . The following day, the JTWC issued a TCFA, citing favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis in the upcoming days. Around 14:00 PHT (06:00 UTC), PAGASA named the system Dante as it intensified into a tropical depression inside the PAR. The JTWC then followed suit, designating it as Tropical Depression 10W . On July 23, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, with the latter assigning it the name Francisco . The storm tracked north-northwestward, maintaining its strength as it passed through the Ryukyu Islands . Francisco then turned westward and entered the Taiwan Strait , minimally affecting Taoyuan County with tropical storm-force winds. After that, increasing mid-level dry air and weak outflow caused the system to weaken into a tropical depression on July 25. It further degenerated into a remnant low the following day before dissipating on July 27.

Shortly after Francisco emerged as a disturbance on July 21, the JTWC identified another tropical disturbance near the Babuyan Islands. Initially assessed as having a low chance of development, the system steadily organized, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA the next day. Later that day, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression, designated 11W by the JTWC, and named Emong by PAGASA. The JMA also promptly recognized the system, naming it Co-may , the replacement for the retired name Lekima .  Due to an imminent Fujiwhara effect , Co-may tracked west-southwestward before looping northeastward toward the Ilocos Region . It later intensified into a typhoon and made its first landfall in Agno, Pangasinan at 22:40 PHT (14:40 UTC), becoming the strongest storm to strike the province since Typhoon Chan-hom in 2009. The storm weakened to a severe tropical storm as it traversed the rugged terrain of the Cordillera Range , making a second landfall over Candon, Ilocos Sur early the next day. around early the next day. Co-may continued to weaken into a tropical depression while moving through the Ryukyu Islands. However, as it tracked east-southeastward, it regained tropical storm strength on July 27 while stalling near Naha. The system then turned west, later veering northwestward, making landfalls on Zhujiajian Island in Zhejiang on July 30 and over Fengxian, Shanghai the following day. Co-may maintained its strength, passing through Yancheng before entering the Yellow Sea , and eventually dissipating when it moved inland over South Korea on August 3.

On July 21, the same day Francisco formed, another disturbance developed under marginal conditions near Guam . As the system gradually consolidated, its chances of development increased. By July 23, the JTWC classified it as a tropical depression, designating it 12W . Although it remained a tropical depression according to the JTWC the following day, the JMA upgraded the system and named it Krosa . The system continued to intensify steadily, reaching typhoon strength on July 27 as recognized by both agencies. However, dry air intrusion shortly thereafter caused Krosa to weaken into a tropical storm. Despite this setback, the system began to recover as it passed near Chiba , regaining strength as a severe tropical storm. Krosa maintained its strength despite a fully exposed, ragged low-level circulation center (LLCC), supported by marginally favorable environmental conditions. Nevertheless, on August 3, it weakened back into a tropical storm for the second time, as increasing vertical wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures took their toll. By August 4, Krosa began undergoing extratropical transition as it entered the baroclinic zone to the north.

On July 31, the JMA identified a tropical depression within the monsoon gyre near Okinawa , which was expected to strengthen. On August 2, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression and designated it 13W . A few hours later, Just a few hours later, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm, with the JMA assigning the name Bailu . Satellite imagery indicated a slowly developing LLCC, with the system remaining asymmetric. Multiple smaller vortices were observed merging, while new convection flared along the storm's outer bands. Bailu was located in a marginally favorable environment, characterized by elevated atmospheric moisture , warm sea surface temperatures of 27–28 °C, low vertical wind shear (5–10 knots), and moderate poleward outflow. However, as it struggled to maintain convection under these conditions, Bailu turned eastward, weakening into a tropical depression on August 4. It further weakened into an extratropical low before dissipating on August 6.

Peak season activity [ edit ] Early on August 2, the weakening Hurricane Iona entered the basin from the Central Pacific as a tropical depression. As it crossed the International Date Line , both the JMA and JTWC began issuing advisories on the system, recognizing it as a depression within the Western Pacific. The JTWC discontinued warnings shortly thereafter, while the JMA continued to monitor Iona until its dissipation on August 4.

Meanwhile, on August 1, a tropical depression developed in the Gulf of Tonkin near northern Vietnam, dissipating the next day after moving inland. Just hours later, a tropical disturbance emerged near Wake Island . Despite situated in an unfavorable environment, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, designating it 14W on August 4. The system was short-lived and failed to intensify, dissipating within hours before another depression, designated 15W by the agency, formed just southwest of Wake Island. 15W later dissipated on August 7.

On August 6, an area of convection developed northeast of Saipan . The following day, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Depression 16W as it rapidly tracked west-northwestward and continued to consolidate. Around the same time, a tropical depression formed northwest of Luzon and was named Fabian by PAGASA the next day upon entering PAR. Despite warm sea surface temperatures, Fabian struggled to maintain its intensity due to strong vertical wind shear over the West Philippine Sea before eventually dissipating on the following day over the South China Sea .

Meanwhile, 16W continued to organize and was upgraded to a tropical storm in the early hours of August 8, receiving the name Podul from the JMA. Podul initially encountered some vertical wind shear near the Northern Mariana Islands , which limited its strengthening. However, it was later upgraded to a severe tropical storm as it continued moving westward. At 01:45 UTC on the following day, Podul was further upgraded to a typhoon by the JMA, becoming the fourth typhoon of this season. Later that day, at 23:20 PHT (15:20 UTC), it entered the PAR and was given the local name Gorio by PAGASA. Podul continued to steadily intensify despite the dry air and wind shear present in the Philippine Sea. On August 12, the JTWC followed suit and upgraded Podul to a minimal typhoon while it was located 417 mi (671 km) south-southeast of Kadena Air Base . It then further intensified into a Category 2-equivalent typhoon before it made landfall over Taimali , Taitung County , Taiwan at around 13:00 TST (05:00 UTC).

The storm then crossed through the Central Mountain Range , weakening into a severe tropical storm as it moved through the Taiwan Strait . Later that day, Podul made another landfall over Zhangpu , Fujian , China. Heavy rainfall triggered by Podul made 8,000 people in Taiwan and 75,000 people in Guangzhou to evacuate, while also leaving two fatalities, 143 injuries and one person missing. Afterwards, the JTWC made its final warning as it moved inland, [ citation needed ] while the JMA continues to track Podul as it weakened into tropical storm. The JMA further downgraded it to a tropical depression until ceasing all advisories on August 15 as it dissipated over Hunan .

On August 17, two tropical depressions formed in the South China Sea and in the Philippine Sea. The following day, the latter depression was named Huaning by PAGASA. The other depression was designated 17W at 09:00 UTC.

Systems [ edit ] Severe Tropical Storm Wutip [ edit ] Severe tropical storm (JMA) Category 1 typhoon (SSHWS) Duration June 9 – June 15 Peak intensity 110 km/h (70 mph) (10-min) ; 980 hPa ( mbar ) Main article: Tropical Storm Wutip (2025) On June 5, the JTWC began tracking an area of atmospheric convection located 300 km (180 mi) west of Yap , noting that the system was in an environment favorable for tropical cyclogenesis .

[ 7 ] The next day, the JMA noted that it had developed into a low-pressure area.

[ 8 ] After crossing Luzon, the JMA indicated that the system had strengthened into a tropical depression over the South China Sea on June 9.

[ 9 ] By 06:00 UTC on June 10, the system was traveling south of the Paracel Islands , [ 10 ] and three hours later, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) and subsequently upgraded it to a tropical depression, [ 11 ] assigning it the designation 01W later that day [ 12 ] as it moved west-northwestward along the southwestern periphery of a mid-level subtropical high .

[ 13 ] The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was named Wutip by the JMA.

[ 14 ] At 18:00 UTC, the JMA further upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm.

[ 15 ] As Wutip approached the subtropical ridge axis later on, it curved northeastward, briefly passed over the far western part of Hainan Island, and made its first landfall near Dongfang City at around 23:00 CST (15:00 UTC) on June 13, [ 16 ] before reemerging over the Gulf of Tonkin shortly after.

[ 17 ] On June 14, the JTWC reported that Wutip had rapidly intensified into a minimal typhoon, although its deep convection had largely collapsed.

[ 18 ] Later that day, Wutip made its second landfall near Leizhou City in Guangdong Province at around 12:30 CST (04:30 UTC).

[ 19 ] After landfall, it weakened into a minimal tropical storm, as satellite imagery indicated that its eye had filled in.

[ 20 ] The JMA downgraded Wutip to a tropical depression on the same day when it was inland, and continued tracking the system until it dissipated at 12:00 UTC on June 15.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Tropical Depression Auring [ edit ] Tropical depression (JMA) Duration June 11 – June 13 Peak intensity 55 km/h (35 mph) (10-min) ; 1002 hPa ( mbar ) On June 11, the JMA announced that a tropical depression had developed east of the Philippines.

[ 23 ] On the same day, PAGASA started monitoring the disturbance as a low-pressure area while it was still inside the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR).

[ 24 ] By the following day, it had intensified into a tropical depression and was named Auring by PAGASA.

[ 25 ] PAGASA reported that Auring made landfall in Taiwan and later weakened into a remnant low due to the frictional effects of its landfall.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] The agency issued its final advisory when the system exited the PAR, [ 28 ] while the JMA continued to monitor it until it was last noted on June 13.

[ 29 ] The system was not tracked by the JTWC .

On June 12, Taiwan's Central Weather Administration issued a heavy rain warning for the counties of Yilan , Hualien , Taitung , and Pingtung .

[ 30 ] Heavy rainfall was recorded in Daliao District , with 205.5 mm (8.1 in) of precipitation recorded.

[ 31 ] At least one fatality and four injuries were reported due to the system.

[ 32 ] In China, the depression brought moisture northward along the edge of the Pacific high , resulting in significant rainfall in Zhejiang and Shanghai , with 52.9 mm (2.1 in) recorded in Shanyang, Shanghai .

[ 33 ] In the Philippines, Auring brought moderate to heavy rainfall and thunderstorms to the provinces of Batanes and Cagayan .

[ 26 ] Tropical Storm Sepat [ edit ] Tropical storm (JMA) Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration June 21 – June 26 Peak intensity 65 km/h (40 mph) (10-min) ; 1004 hPa ( mbar ) A tropical depression formed north of the Northern Mariana Islands on June 21.

[ 34 ] As it continued to develop, the JTWC designated it 02W on the next day.

[ 35 ] The system was situated in an area of low to moderate wind shear near the tropical upper-tropospheric trough , which limited outflow. Despite this, it still managed to intensify into a tropical storm on June 23, receiving the name Sepat from the JMA.

[ 36 ] Steered northwest by a subtropical ridge located to its northeast, Sepat strengthened as its structure improved.

[ 37 ] However, Sepat's convective activity decreased significantly on June 24, halting any intensification.

[ 38 ] Later that day, the JTWC assessed that Sepat had weakened into a tropical depression as it slowed and entered a drier, more hostile environment.

[ 39 ] A trough approaching from the west began to impart strong wind shear on the depression as it neared Japan and turned north-northeastward.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] Further affected by colder sea surface temperatures, Sepat initiated its extratropical transition early on June 26, and as a result, the JTWC discontinued all advisories on Sepat.

[ 42 ] Tropical Depression 03W [ edit ] Tropical depression (JMA) Tropical depression (SSHWS) Duration June 24 – June 27 Peak intensity 55 km/h (35 mph) (10-min) ; 1002 hPa ( mbar ) On June 24, the JMA announced that a tropical depression had developed west of the Philippines. As convective activity increased the next day, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 03W .

[ 43 ] Steered by a subtropical ridge located to its northeast, 03W tracked northwestward and remained poorly organized.

[ 44 ] The depression made landfall on the eastern coast of the Leizhou Peninsula by 02:00 UTC on June 26, [ 45 ] moving inland before dissipating that day.

[ 6 ] Heavy rains battered Northeastern Vietnam , triggering a landslide in Yên Bái Province which destroyed a house, killing one person inside.

[ 46 ] In Hainan, 03W brought severe flooding to regions previously affected by Tropical Storm Wutip , causing widespread damages to crops and roads. Thousands were evacuated as a result, and five people were reported to have died in the flooding.

[ 6 ] Severe Tropical Storm Mun [ edit ] Severe tropical storm (JMA) Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration July 1 – July 8 Peak intensity 95 km/h (60 mph) (10-min) ; 990 hPa ( mbar ) On July 1, the JMA announced that a new tropical depression had developed near the Northern Mariana Islands.

[ citation needed ] Later that day, the JTWC designated the system as a tropical depression, thereby designating it as 04W .

[ 47 ] Though its circulation was initially exposed, by July 2 the cyclone had intensified into a tropical storm, [ 48 ] and it received the name Mun later that day.

[ 49 ] Early on July 3, Mun's convection waned as dry air disrupted the cyclone, [ 50 ] though it began to recover later that day as deep convection returned.

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] Mun later moved through unfavorable conditions, citing dry air environment, weak equatorward outflow aloft, high northeasterly windshear, which helped in degrading back into a tropical storm on July 7.

[ 53 ] JTWC would later discontinue warnings with Mun on July 8 as it started to move through cooler waters, making its deep convection collapse.

Typhoon Danas (Bising) [ edit ] Typhoon (JMA) Category 3 typhoon (SSHWS) Duration July 3 – July 11 Peak intensity 120 km/h (75 mph) (10-min) ; 970 hPa ( mbar ) Main article: Typhoon Danas (2025) Early on July 4, convective activity associated with a disturbance located about 550 km east-southeast of Hong Kong rapidly consolidated. As a result, the JTWC designated the system as tropical depression 05W , while PAGASA named it Bising .

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] Later that day, the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm as it began developing a central dense overcast , [ 56 ] and the JMA accordingly named the system Danas .

[ 57 ] On July 5, JMA later upgraded Danas into a severe tropical storm as it continued to intensify over favorable conditions south-west of Taiwan . Danas headed north and made landfall at peak intensity near Budai , Chiayi County , Taiwan at 23:40 TST (15:40 UTC) on 6 July, making it the first typhoon to make landfall on the western coast of the island since Typhoon Wayne in 1986.

[ 58 ] After traversing Taiwan, it weakened into a severe tropical storm after its low-level structure got weak and disorganized.

[ 59 ] The storm further weakened into a tropical storm before making two more landfalls in Dongtou District , Wenzhou and Rui'an on July 8.

[ 60 ] After landfall, the storm later downgraded into a remnant low as it continued to move inland. JMA continued to track the system until it issued its last warning on July 10.

Heavy rains from Danas and the southwest monsoon affected 13,006 people across 14 barangays in the Philippines , destroying one house and damaging 12 others, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC). Twenty-three areas of Central Luzon reported flooding. At least 219 cities and municipalities suspended classes, while 36 suspended work.

[ 61 ] Two people died from the effects of the storm in Taiwan, while 726 others were injured.

[ 62 ] One person also died in the Philippines due to flooding caused by the storm.

[ 63 ] Tropical Storm Nari [ edit ] Severe tropical storm (JMA) Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration July 11 – July 15 Peak intensity 95 km/h (60 mph) (10-min) ; 985 hPa ( mbar ) A disturbance formed 100 km west of Iwo Jima on July 11 and was designated 06W by the JTWC. On the same day, the JMA followed suit and designated it as a tropical depression.

[ citation needed ] On July 12, 06W later intensified into a tropical storm, which was named Nari by JMA. Satellite imagery showed that Nari was partly obscured, with its deep convection developing to the east of the storm's center.

[ 64 ] Nari was upgraded into a severe tropical storm on July 13 as it continued to strengthen. However, another satellite imagery showed cloud bands spiraling around and getting shallower. Its deep convection also collapsed due to low sea surface temperatures near the edge of the Kuroshio Current .

[ 65 ] Nari transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on July 15 as it moved east-northeastward towards Hokkaido . At 02:00 that day, the storm made landfall near Cape Erimo at the southern tip of the island, the first time that a tropical cyclone made landfall in the prefecture since Tropical Storm Conson in 2016 and the first on record in July since 1951.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] The storm dissipated on July 15, prompting the JTWC to make its final advisory on that day.

Gusty winds, rough surf, and heavy rainfall were reported. A total of 144 mm (5.67 in) of rainfall was recorded in Mie Prefecture . Total economic damages caused by the storm exceeded US$ 1 million.

[ 68 ] Tropical Depression 07W [ edit ] Tropical depression (JMA) Subtropical depression (SSHWS) Duration July 11 – July 14 Peak intensity 55 km/h (35 mph) (10-min) ; 992 hPa ( mbar ) The JTWC noted that a disturbance had developed in the East China Sea 328 km east of Shanghai on July 11. Later, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression at noon. The next day, the JTWC issued warnings on the system despite being a subtropical depression, designating it 07W . Over the next few days, the storm traveled east and made landfall over Kyushu on July 13 with a pressure of 992 hPa according to the JMA.

[ citation needed ] Heavy rains triggered by the depression injured two people in Kanagawa and damaged or flooded 23 homes in Miyazaki , Gifu , Nagano , Tokyo , Gumna , Kanagawa and Fukushima Prefectures .

[ 69 ] Tropical Storm 08W [ edit ] Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration July 15 – July 15 Peak intensity 85 km/h (50 mph) (1-min) ; 1001 hPa ( mbar ) On July 15, JTWC started to track a low-pressure system off the coast of the Ogasawara Islands . Not long after it formed, the system's risk rose to a high chance of development, prompting to issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). Later that same day, it was designated as 08W while the JMA had not yet recognized the system; however, area gale warnings were issued for the eastern coast of Japan. On the same day it started being tracked, the storm accelerated significantly, and between 15:00 and 21:00 JST, it gained a very high translational velocity of 38 miles per hour (61 km/h) while moving north, following a path very similar to Severe Tropical Storm Nari.

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] 08W was later downgraded to a remnant low after it passed over Hokkaido before JTWC issued its last warning on the next day.

Heavy rains triggered by the storm injured two people and damaged or flooded 32 homes in Aichi , Mie , Shizuoka , Gifu and Kanagawa Prefectures .

[ 72 ] Severe Tropical Storm Wipha (Crising) [ edit ] Severe tropical storm (JMA) Category 1 typhoon (SSHWS) Duration July 16 – July 23 Peak intensity 110 km/h (70 mph) (10-min) ; 970 hPa ( mbar ) Main article: Tropical Storm Wipha (2025) An area of low pressure formed inside the PAR about 1,040 km (646 mi) east of the Philippines on July 15.

[ 73 ] By 08:00 PHT (00:00 UTC) on July 16, it developed into a tropical depression and was named Crising by PAGASA .

[ 74 ] The JTWC classified it as a monsoon depression due to its large circulation, later issuing a TCFA as convection increased.

[ 75 ] At 02:00 PHT (18:00 UTC) on July 18, Crising strengthened into a tropical storm, named Wipha by the JMA . The system moved northwest, passing near Santa Ana, Cagayan and the Babuyan Islands as it intensified.

[ 76 ] The JTWC followed suit and subsequently upgraded it to tropical storm 09W .

[ citation needed ] At 08:00 PHT (00:00 UTC) on July 19, Wipha became a severe tropical storm over the South China Sea .

[ 77 ] It gradually intensified into a typhoon before making landfall over Taishan in Guangdong Province .

[ 78 ] Wipha crossed the Gulf of Tonkin and weakened before making a second landfall in Hưng Yên and Ninh Bình provinces, Vietnam, on July 22.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] The JTWC issued its final advisory as the storm weakened inland. Wipha dissipated on July 23. Its remnants later redeveloped over the North Indian Ocean into BOB 04 , which dissipated on July 27.

Wipha enhanced the southwest monsoon, triggering floods in the Philippines [ 81 ] and affecting over 9.5 million people.

[ 82 ] 40 fatalities, 33 injuries, and eight people missing were reported.

[ 83 ] In Hong Kong , the HKO raised Hurricane Signal No. 10, its highest warning level.

[ 84 ] At least 33 people were injured, 711 trees were reported downed, and 277 people were evacuated.

[ 85 ] Tropical Storm Francisco (Dante) [ edit ] Tropical storm (JMA) Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration July 22 – July 27 Peak intensity 75 km/h (45 mph) (10-min) ; 990 hPa ( mbar ) An area of low pressure that had formed south-southwest of Kadena Air Base was first noted by the JTWC on July 21. On July 22, the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression. Both the JTWC and PAGASA followed suit, with PAGASA naming the system Dante , while the JTWC issued a TCWS at first [ 86 ] before designating it as Tropical Depression 10W .

[ 87 ] The following day, the JTWC, PAGASA and JMA upgraded 10W into a tropical storm, receiving the name Francisco from the JMA as it tracked north-northwestward.

[ 88 ] As it tracked in that direction, the storm was steered by the pressure gradient between the subtropical ridge to the north and the monsoon gyre to the south. Satellite imagery indicated a burst of deep convection near the low-level circulation center (LLCC) of Francisco, which briefly caused a northward wobble in its track as the vortex became aligned beneath the convective activity.

[ 89 ] Francisco then turned westwards towards the northern portion of Taiwan Strait , with mid-level dry air environment and weak outflow, making the storm weaken into a tropical depression, and then remnant low on the following day.

[ 90 ] Heavy rain and tropical-storm force winds were reported in the Ryukyu Islands .

[ 91 ] Typhoon Co-may (Emong) [ edit ] Typhoon (JMA) Category 1 typhoon (SSHWS) Duration July 23 – August 3 Peak intensity 120 km/h (75 mph) (10-min) ; 975 hPa ( mbar ) Main article: Typhoon Co-may On July 23, a weak low-pressure area formed northeast of Ilocos Norte .

[ 92 ] It quickly organized over the West Philippine Sea , prompting a TCFA from the JTWC. Soon after, the JTWC, PAGASA, and the JMA classified it as a tropical depression, with PAGASA naming it Emong and the JTWC designating it 11W . It later intensified into a tropical storm, [ 93 ] named Co-may by JMA. Affected by the Fujiwhara effect from Francisco, Co-may looped northeast toward the Ilocos Region .

[ 94 ] On July 24, all agencies upgraded it to a minimal typhoon.

[ 95 ] At 22:40 PHT (06:40 UTC), Co-may made landfall in Agno, Pangasinan , the strongest to hit the province in 16 years , and weakened into a severe tropical storm.

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] It made a second landfall in Candon, Ilocos Sur early July 25 and weakened while crossing the Cordilleras .

[ 98 ] It continued weakening over the Babuyan Channel [ 99 ] and was downgraded to a depression before passing through the Ryukyu Islands .

[ 100 ] Co-may re-strengthened near Okinawa on July 27, then struck Zhujiajian Island , Zhejiang on July 29 and Fengxian , Shanghai on July 30. It became a remnant low on July 31 [ citation needed ] and dissipated on August 3 after crossing Yancheng .

In the Philippines, Co-may caused flooding and wind damage, affecting over 49,000 people, with ₱163.59 million ( US$ 3.32 million) in damages.

[ 101 ] At least 25 people died and 278,000 were displaced.

[ 102 ] Impacted areas included La Union , Alaminos, Pangasinan , [ 103 ] and Naval Station Ernesto Ogbinar in San Fernando, La Union . Five were rescued in Burgos, Ilocos Norte , while flooding affected roads in Bauang .

[ 104 ] In China, flooding killed at least 30 people in Beijing and led to 283,000 evacuations in Shanghai .

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] Typhoon Krosa [ edit ] Typhoon (JMA) Category 1 typhoon (SSHWS) Duration July 23 – August 4 Peak intensity 140 km/h (85 mph) (10-min) ; 965 hPa ( mbar ) On July 21, the JTWC began monitoring a disturbance that had formed near Guam under marginally favorable environmental conditions. The system slowly consolidated over the following days. On July 23, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system, and a few hours later, it was designated as Tropical Depression 12W . The following day, the JMA assigned the system the name Krosa . As its convection began to organize, the JMA upgraded Krosa to severe tropical storm intensity. On July 27, the JMA upgraded Krosa to a typhoon, with JTWC later following suit; however, it weakened into a severe tropical storm on July 28 and then further weakened into a tropical storm on July 30, and then re-strengthed into severe tropical storm on the following day.

[ 107 ] Krosa maintained its strength due to marginally favorable environmental conditions despite the fully exposed, ragged low-level circulation center.

[ 108 ] Krosa deteriorated back again into a tropical storm for the second time on August 3 due to increasing vertical wind shear with cooler waters. On August 4, Krosa would undergo extratropical transition as it crossed into the baroclinic zone to the north.

Tropical Storm Bailu [ edit ] Tropical storm (JMA) Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration July 31 – August 5 Peak intensity 65 km/h (40 mph) (10-min) ; 994 hPa ( mbar ) A tropical depression developed southeast of Okinawa Island on July 31. On August 1, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system, citing the potential for tropical cyclogenesis in the coming days. By the next day, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 13W . In the early hours of August 3, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded 13W to a tropical storm, with the former assigning the name Bailu .

[ 109 ] Satellite imagery at the time indicated a slowly consolidating low-level circulation center (LLCC), although the system remained asymmetric. Several smaller vortices were observed merging, accompanied by intermittent convection along the storm's periphery. Bailu was embedded in a marginally favorable environment, characterized by elevated atmospheric moisture, warm sea surface temperatures of 27–28 °C, low vertical wind shear (5–10 knots), and moderate poleward outflow.

[ 110 ] However, as Bailu turned eastward, it struggled to sustain convection due to less favorable environmental conditions, weakening into a tropical depression on August 4. By August 6, the system had transitioned into an extratropical low after crossing the baroclinic zone and tracking east-northeastward. Shortwave infrared imagery confirmed the completion of its extratropical transition, with wind speeds dropping below 45 km/h (25 knots) as the process concluded.

Tropical Depression Iona [ edit ] Tropical depression (JMA) Tropical depression (SSHWS) Duration August 2 ( Entered basin ) – August 4 Peak intensity 55 km/h (35 mph) (10-min) ; 1008 hPa ( mbar ) The weakening Hurricane Iona , which had originated in the Central Pacific basin since July 24, crossed the International Date Line early on August 2 as a tropical depression .

[ 111 ] Upon entering the Western Pacific basin, both the JMA and the JTWC started monitoring the system and began issuing advisories accordingly. As Iona moved into the new basin, it continued to weaken due to the presence of a dry air mass and persistent vertical wind shear, which hindered any chances of re-intensification. As a result, the JTWC quickly discontinued its warnings shortly after that. However, the JMA continued to track the system's remnants, issuing occasional updates until it was last noted on August 4.

[ 112 ] Tropical Depression 14W [ edit ] Tropical depression (JMA) Tropical depression (SSHWS) Duration August 2 – August 4 Peak intensity <55 km/h (35 mph) (10-min) ; 1010 hPa ( mbar ) A tropical depression formed north of Wake Island on August 2.

[ 113 ] Two days later, the JTWC gave it a high chance of development and issued a TCFA, indicating a fully exposed LLCC that is slowly but steadily intensifying despite being in a marginal environment. Later that day, the system was designated as 14W by the JTWC, as they upgraded it to a tropical depression.

[ 114 ] Satellite derived imagery indicated that 14W's environment was unfavorable for further development, with strong northeasterly shear and dry air present in the Pacific Ocean as the system's structure unraveled. The system dissipated late on August 4 and merged with another disturbance just southwest of Wake Island.

[ 115 ] Tropical Depression 15W [ edit ] Tropical depression (JMA) Tropical depression (SSHWS) Duration August 4 – August 6 Peak intensity <55 km/h (35 mph) (10-min) ; 1006 hPa ( mbar ) The JMA recognized a tropical depression that formed northwest of Wake Island late on August 4, to the south of the remnants of 14W.

[ 115 ] Initially, according to the agency, the system only had a low chance of development due to the surrounding marginal environment. However, its chances increased the following day as it continued to slightly organize despite its current environment. Early on August 6, the JTWC followed suit, designating the depression 15W . The system then proceeded to move northward as dry air impinged from the north and west. Under strong easterly flow and high wind shear of 35–45 km/h (20–25 knots) from the northeast continued eroding the vertical structure of the circulation.

[ 116 ] 15W dissipated hours later on the same day as the circulation became even more stretched out.

[ 117 ] Typhoon Podul (Gorio) [ edit ] Typhoon (JMA) Category 2 typhoon (SSHWS) Duration August 6 – August 15 Peak intensity 150 km/h (90 mph) (10-min) ; 960 hPa ( mbar ) Main article: Typhoon Podul On August 6, the JTWC began monitoring a convective area 230 nautical miles (430 km) northeast of Saipan , which was later classified as a tropical depression by the JMA . A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued on August 7, [ 118 ] and the JTWC designated it as 16W .

[ 119 ] The system intensified into Tropical Storm Podul on August 8.

[ 120 ] Despite initial disruption from northeasterly vertical wind shear , Podul gradually organized, [ 121 ] and the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon on August 9. That same day, it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and was named Gorio by PAGASA .

[ 122 ] The JTWC followed with a typhoon upgrade later that day, citing improved convective structure despite dry air intrusion.

[ 123 ] On August 13, Podul made landfall in Taimali , Taitung County in Taiwan at 13:00 TST (05:00 UTC) as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon.

[ 124 ] Podul then crossed through the Central Mountain Range , weakened significantly before it emerged over the Taiwan Strait . The storm made a second landfall in Zhangpu , Fujian Province at 01:00 CST (17:00 UTC) before weakening inland.

[ 125 ] In Taiwan, Podul left one person missing, 112 injured, and displaced 8,024 residents.

[ 126 ] A man in Kaohsiung was killed after falling while repairing a storm-damaged roof.

[ 127 ] At Taoyuan International Airport , a UPS Airlines Boeing 747 suffered an engine pod strike while landing amid wind shear, prompting a temporary closure of the north runway for repairs and debris removal.

[ 128 ] The typhoon also brought heavy rainfall to parts of Southern China after its second landfall.

Tropical Depression Fabian [ edit ] Tropical depression (JMA) Duration August 7 – August 9 Peak intensity <55 km/h (35 mph) (10-min) ; 1006 hPa ( mbar ) On August 7, the JTWC identified an area of low-pressure that had developed west of Luzon in the Philippines. It then crossed through northern Luzon. The following day, the JMA also began monitoring the system, classifying it as a tropical depression. At 08:00 PHT (00:00 UTC), PAGASA followed suit and upgraded the system to a tropical depression, naming it Fabian .

[ 129 ] On August 9, PAGASA downgraded the system to a low-pressure area before it dissipated later that day as vertical wind shear failed to develop into a tropical cyclone and caused its cloud tops to collapse despite warm sea temperatures.

[ 130 ] Tropical Depression 17W [ edit ] Tropical depression (JMA) Tropical depression (SSHWS) Duration August 17 – Present Peak intensity 55 km/h (35 mph) (10-min) ; 1002 hPa ( mbar ) On August 16, the Vietnam National Centre for Hydro Meteorological Forecasting (NCHMF) , [ 131 ] the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) [ citation needed ] , and the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) reported the formation of a tropical depression over the South China Sea . The NCHMF issued its first warning at 20:00 ICT (13:00 UTC), followed by the HKO at 21:30 HKT (13:30 UTC).

[ 132 ] At 21:00 MST (13:00 UTC) and 22:20 HKT (14:20 UTC), the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau (SMG) [ 133 ] and HKO issued the Standby Signal No. 1 .

[ 134 ] But the storm signal was canceled eventually and replaced it with the Strong Monsoon Signal at 20:20 HKT (12:20 UTC) [ 135 ] , with SMG upgrading to Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 00:00 CST (16:00 UTC) the following day. The JMA began tracking the system on August 17. JTWC later identified it as a monsoon depression, characterized by a broad circulation with stronger winds on the eastern side and a weak center. On August 18, the latter agency issued a TCFA, citing favorable conditions over the Gulf of Tonkin .

[ 136 ] Tropical Depression  Huaning [ edit ] Tropical depression (JMA) Duration August 17 – Present Peak intensity 55 km/h (35 mph) (10-min) ; 1008 hPa ( mbar ) On August 16, JTWC started to track an area of convection 305 nmi (565 km) northeast [ clarification needed ] of Kadena Air Base , citing that the disturbance is in marginal development for tropical cyclogenesis.

[ 137 ] JMA followed suit on the following day and recognized it as a tropical depression.

[ 138 ] At 02:00 PHT (21:00 UTC) of August 18, the PAGASA followed suit and upgraded the low-pressure area into a depression, assigning the name Huaning .

[ 139 ] JTWC also issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for Huaning on the same day, as infrared imagery showed a quickly consolidating and a partially exposed LLCC, embedded within a reverse oriented monsoon trough.

[ 140 ] Although Huaning is not directly affected in the Philippines, classes were suspended over Imus and Kawit , Cavite , including some parts of Cebu due to the inclement weather caused by the storm and southwest monsoon.

[ 141 ] Other systems [ edit ] A tropical depression active on February 11.

On February 11, the JMA noted that a tropical depression had formed west of the Philippines 305 kilometers southwest of Kalayaan, Palawan .

[ 142 ] [ 143 ] The next day, the JTWC began tracking the system around 267 nautical miles (494 km) west-northwest of the Spratly Islands , noting that it was in an unfavorable environment for development, with significant wind shear of 25–30 mph (35–45 km/h) and marginal sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of 26 °C (79 °F).

[ 144 ] As a result, the JTWC stopped tracking the system the next day, noting that it had dissipated.

[ 145 ] The JMA kept tracking the depression until it dissipated on February 15.

[ 146 ] Although it regenerated the next day, [ 147 ] the JMA stopped tracking it by February 17.

[ 148 ] Alongside a low-pressure trough passing through Vietnam, rains from the depression caused several regions in the southeastern parts of the nation to break unseasonal rain records for the month of February, with Ho Chi Minh City recording its heaviest rainfall in the past twenty years. In the town of Long Thành , 175 mm (6.9 in) was recorded.

[ 149 ] Some towns, like Nhà Bè , saw their highest rainfall in 41 years.

[ 150 ] On Hon Doc Island, rainfall reached 128.2 mm (5.05 in) in the early morning of February 16, the highest in the Southwest region on record.

[ 151 ] Additionally, Puerto Princesa and other parts of Palawan saw severe flooding due to rains from the system, a shear line, and the intertropical convergence zone .

[ 143 ] On July 30, the JTWC marked a subtropical depression east of Japan and designated it Invest 92W. It dissipated a few hours later without being recognized by the JMA.

On August 1, the JMA noted that a tropical depression had formed on Gulf of Tonkin. Several hours later, it was removed from the JMA's weather forecast map. However, later that day, the system was reclassified as a tropical depression again, but it was short-lived and dissipated on the following day.

On August 13, the JTWC marked a subtropical depression near the International Date Line and designated it Invest 99W. It dissipated on August 14 without being recognized by JMA.

Storm names [ edit ] See also: Tropical cyclone naming and History of tropical cyclone naming Within the Northwest Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names.

[ 152 ] The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo—Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization 's Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h (40 mph).

[ 153 ] PAGASA names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N and 25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it.

[ 152 ] The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee .

[ 153 ] Should the list of names for the Philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season. Unused names are marked in gray . The names of significant tropical cyclones will be retired by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee in the spring of 2026.

[ 153 ] International names [ edit ] Main article: List of retired Pacific typhoon names A tropical cyclone is named when it is judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h (40 mph).

[ 154 ] The JMA selected the names from a list of 140 names, that had been developed by the 14 members nations and territories of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee .

[ 155 ] Retired names, if any, will be announced by the WMO in 2026, though replacement names will be announced in 2027. The next 28 names on the naming list are listed here along with their international numeric designation, if they are used. All the names in the list are the same, except for Co-may , Nongfa , Ragasa , Koto and Nokaen , which replaced Lekima , Faxai , Hagibis , Kammuri , and Phanfone respectively after the 2019 season . The name Co-may was used for the first time this season.
