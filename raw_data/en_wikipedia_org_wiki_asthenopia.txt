[ 1 ] These symptoms tend to arise after long-term use of computers , staring at phone screens, digital devices, reading, or other activities that involve extended visual tasks.

[ 2 ] Various causes contribute to eye strain, including uncorrected vision problems, [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] digital device usage, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] environmental factors, [ 1 ] and underlying health conditions.

[ 3 ] When concentrating on a visually intense task, such as continuously focusing on a book or computer monitor, the ciliary muscles and the extraocular muscles are strained , also contributing to the symptoms.

[ 7 ] These symptoms are broadly classified into external (related to the ocular surface) and internal symptom factors (related to eye muscles).

[ 1 ] Treatment involves environmental modifications, visual aids, [ 7 ] and taking periodic breaks.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] The experience of eye strain when reading in dim light has given rise to the common misconception that such an activity causes permanent eye damage.

[ 9 ] Causes [ edit ] Asthenopia can result from various factors. These causes can be categorized as ocular issues, [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] digital use patterns, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] environmental factors, [ 1 ] or underlying health conditions, [ 3 ] including: [ 1 ] [ 4 ] Uncorrected refractive errors ( astigmatism , hyperopia , anisometropia , etc.) [ 6 ] Eye movement coordination Accommodative [ 6 ] and vergence stress Glare Flickering lights Allergy [ 3 ] Close viewing distance Dry-eye Fatigue [ 3 ] Upward gaze Prolonged reading from smartphone [ 5 ] Symptoms [ edit ] Eye strain's symptoms can be broken into two groups: Internal Symptom Factors (ISF) and External Symptom Factors (ESF).

[ 1 ] ESFs consist of symptoms related to dry-eye such as burning and irritation, seemingly linked to the ocular surface.

[ 1 ] ISFs are related to pain and ache sensations behind the eye and are linked to accommodative and vergence stress, caused by poor visual conditions.

[ 1 ] [ 10 ] Symptoms of eye strain can include: [ 1 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 10 ] blurred vision headache sore, irritated, burning, or itching eyes dry eyes or watery eyes eye discomfort difficulty concentrating sensitivity to bright lights Therapy [ edit ] Given that asthenopia is caused by different factors, treatment may involve the work environment or visual conditions.

[ 1 ] One known method of relieving strain of the ocular muscles is taking periodic breaks by closing the eyes [ 7 ] and blinking frequently.

[ 8 ] Often found in connection to Digital Eye Strain (DES), eye strain can be reduced by following the 20-20-20 rule, which consists of looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes.
