The name is derived from a house slated for demolition on Metcalf Street in Honolulu, in which they exhibited in 1954.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The exhibition was seen by Robert Griffin, director of the Honolulu Academy of Arts , who arranged for the artists to have a group show at the museum.

[ 4 ] The group's members were Satoru Abe (1926-2025), Bumpei Akaji (1921–2002), Edmund Chung , Tetsuo Ochikubo (1923–1975), Jerry T. Okimoto (1924–1998), James Park , and Tadashi Sato (1923–2005).

The Metcalf Chateau overlaps with a loosely associated group of eleven modernist artists of Japanese descent, all nisei (second generation) born in Hawaii.  These artists are Satoru Abe , Bumpei Akaji , Isami Doi , Keichi Kimura , Sueko Matsueda Kimura , Harue Oyama McVay , Tetsuo Ochikubo , Jerry T. Okimoto , Tadashi Sato , Toshiko Takaezu , and Harry Tsuchidana .

[ 5 ] Isami Doi (1903–1965) was the oldest of these eleven artists and mentored many of them.
