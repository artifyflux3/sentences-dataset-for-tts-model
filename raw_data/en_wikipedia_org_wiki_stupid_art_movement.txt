[ 1 ] The founding members were Willy Fick , Heinrich Hoerle , Angelika Hoerle , Anton Räderscheidt , Marta Hegemann , and Franz Wilhelm Seiwert .

[ 2 ] Political goals [ edit ] The Stupid group aimed to address sociopolitical issues through an art of proletarian character.

[ 2 ] Seiwert and Räderscheidt had previously been active in the Cologne Dada scene, along with Max Ernst . Ernst later described Stupid as "a secession from Cologne Dada. As far as Hoerle and especially Seiwert were concerned, Dada's activities were aesthetically too radical and socially not concrete enough".

[ 3 ] Seiwert described the group's esthetic: "We are attempting to be so clear that everyone will be able to understand us." [ 4 ] Disbanding [ edit ] Räderscheidt's studio was their base of operations, but by 1920 he had abandoned the constructivist style.

[ 1 ] The group exhibited together and issued a publication, "Stupid 1", before disbanding. Many of the members joined the Cologne Progressives group.
