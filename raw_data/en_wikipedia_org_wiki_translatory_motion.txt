In Euclidean geometry , a translation is a geometric transformation that moves every point of a figure, shape or space by the same distance in a given direction . A translation can also be interpreted as the addition of a constant vector to every point, or as shifting the origin of the coordinate system . In a Euclidean space , any translation is an isometry .

As a function [ edit ] See also: Displacement (geometry) If v {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} } is a fixed vector, known as the translation vector , and p {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} } is the initial position of some object, then the translation function T v {\displaystyle T_{\mathbf {v} }} will work as T v ( p ) = p + v {\displaystyle T_{\mathbf {v} }(\mathbf {p} )=\mathbf {p} +\mathbf {v} } .

If T {\displaystyle T} is a translation, then the image of a subset A {\displaystyle A} under the function T {\displaystyle T} is the translate of A {\displaystyle A} by T {\displaystyle T} . The translate of A {\displaystyle A} by T v {\displaystyle T_{\mathbf {v} }} is often written as A + v {\displaystyle A+\mathbf {v} } .

Application in classical physics [ edit ] In classical physics , translational motion is movement that changes the position of an object, as opposed to rotation . For example, according to Whittaker: [ 1 ] If a body is moved from one position to another, and if the lines joining the initial and final points of each of the points of the body are a set of parallel straight lines of length ℓ , so that the orientation of the body in space is unaltered, the displacement is called a translation parallel to the direction of the lines, through a distance ℓ .

— E. T. Whittaker , A Treatise on the Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies , p. 1 A translation is the operation changing the positions of all points ( x , y , z ) {\displaystyle (x,y,z)} of an object according to the formula ( x , y , z ) → → ( x + Δ Δ x , y + Δ Δ y , z + Δ Δ z ) {\displaystyle (x,y,z)\to (x+\Delta x,y+\Delta y,z+\Delta z)} where ( Δ Δ x , Δ Δ y , Δ Δ z ) {\displaystyle (\Delta x,\ \Delta y,\ \Delta z)} is the same vector for each point of the object. The translation vector ( Δ Δ x , Δ Δ y , Δ Δ z ) {\displaystyle (\Delta x,\ \Delta y,\ \Delta z)} common to all points of the object describes a particular type of displacement of the object, usually called a linear displacement to distinguish it from displacements involving rotation, called angular displacements.

When considering spacetime , a change of time coordinate is considered to be a translation.

As an operator [ edit ] Main article: Shift operator The translation operator turns a function of the original position, f ( v ) {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {v} )} , into a function of the final position, f ( v + δ δ ) {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {\delta } )} . In other words, T δ δ {\displaystyle T_{\mathbf {\delta } }} is defined such that T δ δ f ( v ) = f ( v + δ δ ) .

{\displaystyle T_{\mathbf {\delta } }f(\mathbf {v} )=f(\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {\delta } ).} This operator is more abstract than a function, since T δ δ {\displaystyle T_{\mathbf {\delta } }} defines a relationship between two functions, rather than the underlying vectors themselves. The translation operator can act on many kinds of functions, such as when the translation operator acts on a wavefunction , which is studied in the field of quantum mechanics.

As a group [ edit ] See also: Translation operator (quantum mechanics) § Translation group The set of all translations forms the translation group T {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } , which is isomorphic to the space itself, and a normal subgroup of Euclidean group E ( n ) {\displaystyle E(n)} . The quotient group of E ( n ) {\displaystyle E(n)} by T {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } is isomorphic to the group of rigid motions which fix a particular origin point, the orthogonal group O ( n ) {\displaystyle O(n)} : E ( n ) / T ≅ ≅ O ( n ) {\displaystyle E(n)/\mathbb {T} \cong O(n)} Because translation is commutative , the translation group is abelian . There are an infinite number of possible translations, so the translation group is an infinite group .

In the theory of relativity , due to the treatment of space and time as a single spacetime , translations can also refer to changes in the time coordinate . For example, the Galilean group and the Poincaré group include translations with respect to time.

Lattice groups [ edit ] Main article: Lattice (group) One kind of subgroup of the three-dimensional translation group are the lattice groups , which are infinite groups , but unlike the translation groups, are finitely generated . That is, a finite generating set generates the entire group.

Matrix representation [ edit ] A translation is an affine transformation with no fixed points . Matrix multiplications always have the origin as a fixed point. Nevertheless, there is a common workaround using homogeneous coordinates to represent a translation of a vector space with matrix multiplication : Write the 3-dimensional vector v = ( v x , v y , v z ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =(v_{x},v_{y},v_{z})} using 4 homogeneous coordinates as v = ( v x , v y , v z , 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =(v_{x},v_{y},v_{z},1)} .

[ 2 ] To translate an object by a vector v {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} } , each homogeneous vector p {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} } (written in homogeneous coordinates) can be multiplied by this translation matrix : T v = [ 1 0 0 v x 0 1 0 v y 0 0 1 v z 0 0 0 1 ] {\displaystyle T_{\mathbf {v} }={\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&v_{x}\\0&1&0&v_{y}\\0&0&1&v_{z}\\0&0&0&1\end{bmatrix}}} As shown below, the multiplication will give the expected result: T v p = [ 1 0 0 v x 0 1 0 v y 0 0 1 v z 0 0 0 1 ] [ p x p y p z 1 ] = [ p x + v x p y + v y p z + v z 1 ] = p + v {\displaystyle T_{\mathbf {v} }\mathbf {p} ={\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&v_{x}\\0&1&0&v_{y}\\0&0&1&v_{z}\\0&0&0&1\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}p_{x}\\p_{y}\\p_{z}\\1\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}p_{x}+v_{x}\\p_{y}+v_{y}\\p_{z}+v_{z}\\1\end{bmatrix}}=\mathbf {p} +\mathbf {v} } The inverse of a translation matrix can be obtained by reversing the direction of the vector: T v − − 1 = T − − v .

{\displaystyle T_{\mathbf {v} }^{-1}=T_{-\mathbf {v} }.\!} Similarly, the product of translation matrices is given by adding the vectors: T v T w = T v + w .

{\displaystyle T_{\mathbf {v} }T_{\mathbf {w} }=T_{\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {w} }.\!} Because addition of vectors is commutative , multiplication of translation matrices is therefore also commutative (unlike multiplication of arbitrary matrices).

Translation of axes [ edit ] Main article: Translation of axes While geometric translation is often viewed as an active transformation that changes the position of a geometric object, a similar result can be achieved by a passive transformation that moves the coordinate system itself but leaves the object fixed. The passive version of an active geometric translation is known as a translation of axes .

Translational symmetry [ edit ] Main article: Translational symmetry An object that looks the same before and after translation is said to have translational symmetry . A common example is a periodic function , which is an eigenfunction of a translation operator.

Translations of a graph [ edit ] "Vertical translation" redirects here. For the concept in physics, see Vertical separation .

Compared to the graph y = f ( x ) , the graph y = f ( x − a ) has been translated horizontally by a , while the graph y = f ( x ) + b has been translated vertically by b .

The graph of a real function f , the set of points ⁠ ( x , f ( x ) ) {\displaystyle (x,f(x))} ⁠ , is often pictured in the real coordinate plane with x as the horizontal coordinate and ⁠ y = f ( x ) {\displaystyle y=f(x)} ⁠ as the vertical coordinate.

Starting from the graph of f , a horizontal translation means composing f with a function ⁠ x ↦ ↦ x − − a {\displaystyle x\mapsto x-a} ⁠ , for some constant number a , resulting in a graph consisting of points ⁠ ( x , f ( x − − a ) ) {\displaystyle (x,f(x-a))} ⁠ . Each point ⁠ ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} ⁠ of the original graph corresponds to the point ⁠ ( x + a , y ) {\displaystyle (x+a,y)} ⁠ in the new graph, which pictorially results in a horizontal shift.

A vertical translation means composing the function ⁠ y ↦ ↦ y + b {\displaystyle y\mapsto y+b} ⁠ with f , for some constant b , resulting in a graph consisting of the points ⁠ ( x , f ( x ) + b ) {\displaystyle {\bigl (}x,f(x)+b{\bigr )}} ⁠ . Each point ⁠ ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} ⁠ of the original graph corresponds to the point ⁠ ( x , y + b ) {\displaystyle (x,y+b)} ⁠ in the new graph, which pictorially results in a vertical shift.

[ 3 ] For example, taking the quadratic function ⁠ y = x 2 {\displaystyle y=x^{2}} ⁠ , whose graph is a parabola with vertex at ⁠ ( 0 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (0,0)} ⁠ , a horizontal translation 5 units to the right would be the new function ⁠ y = ( x − − 5 ) 2 = x 2 − − 10 x + 25 {\displaystyle y=(x-5)^{2}=x^{2}-10x+25} ⁠ whose vertex has coordinates ⁠ ( 5 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (5,0)} ⁠ . A vertical translation 3 units upward would be the new function ⁠ y = x 2 + 3 {\displaystyle y=x^{2}+3} ⁠ whose vertex has coordinates ⁠ ( 0 , 3 ) {\displaystyle (0,3)} ⁠ .

The antiderivatives of a function all differ from each other by a constant of integration and are therefore vertical translates of each other.

[ 4 ] Applications [ edit ] For describing vehicle dynamics (or movement of any rigid body ), including ship dynamics and aircraft dynamics , it is common to use a mechanical model consisting of six degrees of freedom , which includes translations along three reference axes (as well as rotations about those three axes). These translations are often called surge , sway , and heave .
