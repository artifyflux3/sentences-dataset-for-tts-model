Based on the 1974 novel of the same name by Frederick Forsyth , it follows a small mercenary unit of soldiers privately hired to depose the president of a fictional African country modeled on Guinea-Bissau , Guinea-Conakry , Equatorial Guinea and Angola (as they were in the late 1970s), so that a British tycoon can gain access to a platinum deposit.

[ 4 ] The title is based on a phrase from William Shakespeare 's play Julius Caesar : "Cry, 'Havoc!', and let slip the dogs of war." Plot [ edit ] Having escaped from Central America with his comrades Drew Blakeley, Derek Godwin, Michel-Claude, Terry and Richard, mercenary Jamie Shannon gets an offer from Endean, a British businessman working for a tycoon. Endean's company is interested in "certain resources" in the small African nation of Zangaro, which is run by the brutal dictator, President Kimba.

Shannon goes on a reconnaissance mission to Zangaro's capital of Clarence and meets British documentary film maker Alan North, who fills him in on the political situation in Zangaro. Shannon's activities arouse the suspicions of the police (especially a suspected dalliance with Gabrielle Dexter, a woman who turns out to be one of Kimba's mistresses) and he is arrested, severely beaten and imprisoned. His wounds are treated by Dr. Okoye, a physician and prisoner who was formerly a moderate political leader. North agitates for Shannon's release and two days later he is deported.

When Shannon tells Endean that there is no chance of a coup , Endean offers him $100,000 to overthrow Kimba by invading Zangaro with a mercenary army. Endean's employer intends to install a puppet government led by Colonel Bobi, Kimba's greedy former ally, allowing Endean's employer to exploit the country's newly discovered platinum resources, an agreement guaranteed by Colonel Bobi. Shannon refuses the offer and instead proposes to his estranged girlfriend Jessie that they start a new life in the Western U.S.

When she refuses his proposal, he accepts Endean's contract on condition that he will have control of the military operation.

Provided with a million dollars for expenses, Shannon contacts some of his associates from Central America and they meet in London to plan the invasion. The group illegally procures a supply of Uzi submachine guns, ammunition, rocket launchers , mines and other weapons from arms dealers. North encounters Shannon by chance in London and suspects him of being a CIA agent. Shannon asks Drew to scare North away without hurting him but North is killed by a hitman hired by Endean to follow Shannon and his crew. Drew captures the assassin, and when a furious Shannon learns that Endean had sent the hitman but that the hitman had killed North on his own initiative he kills the assassin in turn and leaves the body at Endean's house during a dinner party held for Colonel Bobi.

To transport the group and equipment to the coast of Zangaro, Shannon hires a small freighter and crew. At sea, the team is joined by a force of Zangaran exiles trained as soldiers by a former mercenary colleague. Once ashore in a night attack, the mercenaries and their troops use their array of weapons to attack the military garrison where Kimba lives. Drew bursts into a shack in the barracks' courtyard and finds only a young woman with a baby; when he turns to leave without harming them, she shoots him in the back with a pistol. After the mercenaries storm the burning, bullet-scarred ruins of the garrison, Shannon blasts his way into Kimba's mansion. There he finds Kimba stuffing packs of bills into a briefcase; when a whimpering Kimba offers Shannon some of the money to spare his life, Shannon kills him.

The following morning, Endean arrives by helicopter with Colonel Bobi and they enter the presidential residence, where they find Shannon and Dr. Okoye awaiting their overdue arrival. Shannon introduces Dr. Okoye as Zangaro's new president who tells Colonel Bobi that he is under arrest, and when Endean protests ("This whole country's bought and paid for!"), Shannon tells him, "You're going to have to buy it all over again," and silences him by shooting Bobi. Shannon, Derek and Michel load Drew's body onto a Land Rover , in line with the toast they drank on planning the operation "Everyone comes home". The film concludes with the mercenaries driving through the deserted streets of Clarence until they are out of frame.

Don Siegel was going to direct but did not like the screenplay and Abby Mann wrote a new one.

Michael Cimino wrote another draft and Norman Jewison became attached as producer-director and Gary DeVore rewrote the script. Jewison decided to produce instead and looked for another director. Jewison hired Michael Cimino to direct with Clint Eastwood and Nick Nolte starring, but he dropped out of the film in order to work on Heaven's Gate and John Irvin became director.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Principal photography began on February 18, 1980.

[ 5 ] The opening Central American scene was filmed at the Miami Glider Port southwest of Miami, Florida . Later African country scenes were filmed in Belize City , Belize, and the surrounding area, since Irwin decided shooting the scenes in Africa in real-life would be too risky.

[ 5 ] The manually-turned swinging bridge shown during the attack is one of the largest of its kind in the world. The film features several weapons that were prominent in popular culture during the 1980s. The Uzi submachine guns used in the film (changed from the German Second World War vintage Schmeissers of the novel) were a mix of real Uzis and set-dressed Ingram MAC-10s .

[ citation needed ] Shannon's grenade launcher, depicted in the promotional poster, dubbed the "XM-18" in the film, is a Manville gun – a design later used by the MM-1 grenade launcher .

[ citation needed ] Shooting also took place in New York City and London .

[ 5 ] This was only the second international feature for director John Irvin, who had worked as a documentary maker during the Vietnam War . He went on to direct stars such as Arnold Schwarzenegger ( Raw Deal ), Don Cheadle ( Hamburger Hill ) and Michael Caine ( Shiner ). Cinematographer Jack Cardiff had previously directed an account of mercenaries in Africa entitled Dark of the Sun . Composer Geoffrey Burgon concludes the film with A. E. Housman 's Epitaph on an Army of Mercenaries sung over the end titles.

Release [ edit ] The Dogs of War had its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 17 December 1980 before opening to the public the following day.

[ 7 ] It was released to DVD by MGM Home Video on 20 November 2001 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and later on by Twilight Time (under license from MGM) as a multi-region Blu-ray disc.

Norman Jewison wrote in his memoirs: The Dogs of War is one film I would rather have directed than produced, but I was proud to be associated with it in any capacity. It had modest success in North America but was well received in Europe, where there is more interest in African politics and a better understanding of the underside of corporate power in poor countries.
