More generally, it is a differential form with values in some vector bundle E over M . Ordinary differential forms can be viewed as R -valued differential forms.

An important case of vector-valued differential forms are Lie algebra-valued forms . (A connection form is an example of such a form.) Definition [ edit ] Let M be a smooth manifold and E → M be a smooth vector bundle over M . We denote the space of smooth sections of a bundle E by Γ( E ). An E -valued differential form of degree p is a smooth section of the tensor product bundle of E with Λ p ( T ∗ M ), the p -th exterior power of the cotangent bundle of M . The space of such forms is denoted by Ω Ω p ( M , E ) = Γ Γ ( E ⊗ ⊗ Λ Λ p T ∗ ∗ M ) .

{\displaystyle \Omega ^{p}(M,E)=\Gamma (E\otimes \Lambda ^{p}T^{*}M).} Because Γ is a strong monoidal functor , [ 1 ] this can also be interpreted as Γ Γ ( E ⊗ ⊗ Λ Λ p T ∗ ∗ M ) = Γ Γ ( E ) ⊗ ⊗ Ω Ω 0 ( M ) Γ Γ ( Λ Λ p T ∗ ∗ M ) = Γ Γ ( E ) ⊗ ⊗ Ω Ω 0 ( M ) Ω Ω p ( M ) , {\displaystyle \Gamma (E\otimes \Lambda ^{p}T^{*}M)=\Gamma (E)\otimes _{\Omega ^{0}(M)}\Gamma (\Lambda ^{p}T^{*}M)=\Gamma (E)\otimes _{\Omega ^{0}(M)}\Omega ^{p}(M),} where the latter two tensor products are the tensor product of modules over the ring Ω 0 ( M ) of smooth R -valued functions on M (see the seventh example here ).  By convention, an E -valued 0-form is just a section of the bundle E . That is, Ω Ω 0 ( M , E ) = Γ Γ ( E ) .

{\displaystyle \Omega ^{0}(M,E)=\Gamma (E).\,} Equivalently, an E -valued differential form can be defined as a bundle morphism T M ⊗ ⊗ ⋯ ⋯ ⊗ ⊗ T M → → E {\displaystyle TM\otimes \cdots \otimes TM\to E} which is totally skew-symmetric .

Let V be a fixed vector space . A V -valued differential form of degree p is a differential form of degree p with values in the trivial bundle M × V . The space of such forms is denoted Ω p ( M , V ). When V = R one recovers the definition of an ordinary differential form.  If V is finite-dimensional, then one can show that the natural homomorphism Ω Ω p ( M ) ⊗ ⊗ R V → → Ω Ω p ( M , V ) , {\displaystyle \Omega ^{p}(M)\otimes _{\mathbb {R} }V\to \Omega ^{p}(M,V),} where the first tensor product is of vector spaces over R , is an isomorphism.

[ 2 ] Operations on vector-valued forms [ edit ] Pullback [ edit ] One can define the pullback of vector-valued forms by smooth maps just as for ordinary forms. The pullback of an E -valued form on N by a smooth map φ : M → N is an (φ* E )-valued form on M , where φ* E is the pullback bundle of E by φ.

The formula is given just as in the ordinary case. For any E -valued p -form ω on N the pullback φ*ω is given by ( φ φ ∗ ∗ ω ω ) x ( v 1 , ⋯ ⋯ , v p ) = ω ω φ φ ( x ) ( d φ φ x ( v 1 ) , ⋯ ⋯ , d φ φ x ( v p ) ) .

{\displaystyle (\varphi ^{*}\omega )_{x}(v_{1},\cdots ,v_{p})=\omega _{\varphi (x)}(\mathrm {d} \varphi _{x}(v_{1}),\cdots ,\mathrm {d} \varphi _{x}(v_{p})).} Wedge product [ edit ] Just as for ordinary differential forms, one can define a wedge product of vector-valued forms. The wedge product of an E 1 -valued p -form with an E 2 -valued q -form is naturally an ( E 1 ⊗ E 2 )-valued ( p + q )-form: ∧ ∧ : Ω Ω p ( M , E 1 ) × × Ω Ω q ( M , E 2 ) → → Ω Ω p + q ( M , E 1 ⊗ ⊗ E 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \wedge :\Omega ^{p}(M,E_{1})\times \Omega ^{q}(M,E_{2})\to \Omega ^{p+q}(M,E_{1}\otimes E_{2}).} The definition is just as for ordinary forms with the exception that real multiplication is replaced with the tensor product : ( ω ω ∧ ∧ η η ) ( v 1 , ⋯ ⋯ , v p + q ) = 1 p !

q !

∑ ∑ σ σ ∈ ∈ S p + q sgn ⁡ ⁡ ( σ σ ) ω ω ( v σ σ ( 1 ) , ⋯ ⋯ , v σ σ ( p ) ) ⊗ ⊗ η η ( v σ σ ( p + 1 ) , ⋯ ⋯ , v σ σ ( p + q ) ) .

{\displaystyle (\omega \wedge \eta )(v_{1},\cdots ,v_{p+q})={\frac {1}{p!q!}}\sum _{\sigma \in S_{p+q}}\operatorname {sgn}(\sigma )\omega (v_{\sigma (1)},\cdots ,v_{\sigma (p)})\otimes \eta (v_{\sigma (p+1)},\cdots ,v_{\sigma (p+q)}).} In particular, the wedge product of an ordinary ( R -valued) p -form with an E -valued q -form is naturally an E -valued ( p + q )-form (since the tensor product of E with the trivial bundle M × R is naturally isomorphic to E ). 
In terms of local frames { e α } and { l β } for E 1 and E 2 respectively, the wedge product of an E 1 -valued p -form ω = ω α e α , and an E 2 -valued q -form η = η β l β is ω ω ∧ ∧ η η = ∑ ∑ α α , β β ( ω ω α α ∧ ∧ η η β β ) ( e α α ⊗ ⊗ l β β ) , {\displaystyle \omega \wedge \eta =\sum _{\alpha ,\beta }(\omega ^{\alpha }\wedge \eta ^{\beta })(e_{\alpha }\otimes l_{\beta }),} where ω α ∧ η β is the ordinary wedge product of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } -valued forms.
For ω ∈ Ω p ( M ) and η ∈ Ω q ( M , E ) one has the usual commutativity relation: ω ω ∧ ∧ η η = ( − − 1 ) p q η η ∧ ∧ ω ω .

{\displaystyle \omega \wedge \eta =(-1)^{pq}\eta \wedge \omega .} In general, the wedge product of two E -valued forms is not another E -valued form, but rather an ( E ⊗ E )-valued form. However, if E is an algebra bundle (i.e. a bundle of algebras rather than just vector spaces) one can compose with multiplication in E to obtain an E -valued form. If E is a bundle of commutative , associative algebras then, with this modified wedge product, the set of all E -valued differential forms Ω Ω ( M , E ) = ⨁ ⨁ p = 0 dim ⁡ ⁡ M Ω Ω p ( M , E ) {\displaystyle \Omega (M,E)=\bigoplus _{p=0}^{\dim M}\Omega ^{p}(M,E)} becomes a graded-commutative associative algebra. If the fibers of E are not commutative then Ω( M , E ) will not be graded-commutative.

Exterior derivative [ edit ] For any vector space V there is a natural exterior derivative on the space of V -valued forms. This is just the ordinary exterior derivative acting component-wise relative to any basis of V . Explicitly, if { e α } is a basis for V then the differential of a V -valued p -form ω = ω α e α is given by d ω ω = ( d ω ω α α ) e α α .

{\displaystyle d\omega =(d\omega ^{\alpha })e_{\alpha }.\,} The exterior derivative on V -valued forms is completely characterized by the usual relations: d ( ω ω + η η ) = d ω ω + d η η d ( ω ω ∧ ∧ η η ) = d ω ω ∧ ∧ η η + ( − − 1 ) p ω ω ∧ ∧ d η η ( p = deg ⁡ ⁡ ω ω ) d ( d ω ω ) = 0.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&d(\omega +\eta )=d\omega +d\eta \\&d(\omega \wedge \eta )=d\omega \wedge \eta +(-1)^{p}\,\omega \wedge d\eta \qquad (p=\deg \omega )\\&d(d\omega )=0.\end{aligned}}} More generally, the above remarks apply to E -valued forms where E is any flat vector bundle over M (i.e. a vector bundle whose transition functions are constant). The exterior derivative is defined as above on any local trivialization of E .

If E is not flat then there is no natural notion of an exterior derivative acting on E -valued forms. What is needed is a choice of connection on E . A connection on E is a linear differential operator taking sections of E to E -valued one forms: ∇ ∇ : Ω Ω 0 ( M , E ) → → Ω Ω 1 ( M , E ) .

{\displaystyle \nabla :\Omega ^{0}(M,E)\to \Omega ^{1}(M,E).} If E is equipped with a connection ∇ then there is a unique covariant exterior derivative d ∇ ∇ : Ω Ω p ( M , E ) → → Ω Ω p + 1 ( M , E ) {\displaystyle d_{\nabla }:\Omega ^{p}(M,E)\to \Omega ^{p+1}(M,E)} extending ∇. The covariant exterior derivative is characterized by linearity and the equation d ∇ ∇ ( ω ω ∧ ∧ η η ) = d ∇ ∇ ω ω ∧ ∧ η η + ( − − 1 ) p ω ω ∧ ∧ d η η {\displaystyle d_{\nabla }(\omega \wedge \eta )=d_{\nabla }\omega \wedge \eta +(-1)^{p}\,\omega \wedge d\eta } where ω is a E -valued p -form and η is an ordinary q -form. In general, one need not have d ∇ 2 = 0. In fact, this happens if and only if the connection ∇ is flat (i.e. has vanishing curvature ).

Basic or tensorial forms on principal bundles [ edit ] Let E → M be a smooth vector bundle of rank k over M and let π : F( E ) → M be the ( associated ) frame bundle of E , which is a principal GL k ( R ) bundle over M . The pullback of E by π is canonically isomorphic to F( E ) × ρ R k via the inverse of [ u , v ] → u ( v ), where ρ is the standard representation. Therefore, the pullback by π of an E -valued form on M determines an R k -valued form on F( E ). It is not hard to check that this pulled back form is right-equivariant with respect to the natural action of GL k ( R ) on F( E ) × R k and vanishes on vertical vectors (tangent vectors to F( E ) which lie in the kernel of d π ). Such vector-valued forms on F( E ) are important enough to warrant special terminology: they are called basic or tensorial forms on F( E ).

Let π : P → M be a (smooth) principal G -bundle and let V be a fixed vector space together with a representation ρ : G → GL( V ). A basic or tensorial form on P of type ρ is a V -valued form ω on P that is equivariant and horizontal in the sense that ( R g ) ∗ ∗ ω ω = ρ ρ ( g − − 1 ) ω ω {\displaystyle (R_{g})^{*}\omega =\rho (g^{-1})\omega \,} for all g ∈ G , and ω ω ( v 1 , … … , v p ) = 0 {\displaystyle \omega (v_{1},\ldots ,v_{p})=0} whenever at least one of the v i are vertical (i.e., d π ( v i ) = 0).

Here R g denotes the right action of G on P for some g ∈ G . Note that for 0-forms the second condition is vacuously true .

Example: If ρ is the adjoint representation of G on the Lie algebra, then the connection form ω satisfies the first condition (but not the second). The associated curvature form Ω satisfies both; hence Ω is a tensorial form of adjoint type. The "difference" of two connection forms is a tensorial form.

Given P and ρ as above one can construct the associated vector bundle E = P × ρ V . Tensorial q -forms on P are in a natural one-to-one correspondence with E -valued q -forms on M . As in the case of the principal bundle F( E ) above, given a q -form ϕ ϕ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\phi }}} on M with values in E , define φ on P fiberwise by, say at u , ϕ ϕ = u − − 1 π π ∗ ∗ ϕ ϕ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle \phi =u^{-1}\pi ^{*}{\overline {\phi }}} where u is viewed as a linear isomorphism V → → ≃ ≃ E π π ( u ) = ( π π ∗ ∗ E ) u , v ↦ ↦ [ u , v ] {\displaystyle V{\overset {\simeq }{\to }}E_{\pi (u)}=(\pi ^{*}E)_{u},v\mapsto [u,v]} . φ is then a tensorial form of type ρ. Conversely, given a tensorial form φ of type ρ, the same formula defines an E -valued form ϕ ϕ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\phi }}} on M (cf. the Chern–Weil homomorphism .) In particular, there is a natural isomorphism of vector spaces Γ Γ ( M , E ) ≃ ≃ { f : P → → V | f ( u g ) = ρ ρ ( g ) − − 1 f ( u ) } , f ¯ ¯ ↔ ↔ f {\displaystyle \Gamma (M,E)\simeq \{f:P\to V|f(ug)=\rho (g)^{-1}f(u)\},\,{\overline {f}}\leftrightarrow f} .

Example: Let E be the tangent bundle of M . Then identity bundle map id E : E → E is an E -valued one form on M . The tautological one-form is a unique one-form on the frame bundle of E that corresponds to id E . Denoted by θ, it is a tensorial form of standard type.

Now, suppose there is a connection on P so that there is an exterior covariant differentiation D on (various) vector-valued forms on P . Through the above correspondence, D also acts on E -valued forms: define ∇ by ∇ ∇ ϕ ϕ ¯ ¯ = D ϕ ϕ ¯ ¯ .

{\displaystyle \nabla {\overline {\phi }}={\overline {D\phi }}.} In particular for zero-forms, ∇ ∇ : Γ Γ ( M , E ) → → Γ Γ ( M , T ∗ ∗ M ⊗ ⊗ E ) {\displaystyle \nabla :\Gamma (M,E)\to \Gamma (M,T^{*}M\otimes E)} .

This is exactly the covariant derivative for the connection on the vector bundle E .

^ Proof: One can verify this for p =0 by turning a basis for V into a set of constant functions to V , which allows the construction of an inverse to the above homomorphism.  The general case can be proved by noting that Ω Ω p ( M , V ) = Ω Ω 0 ( M , V ) ⊗ ⊗ Ω Ω 0 ( M ) Ω Ω p ( M ) , {\displaystyle \Omega ^{p}(M,V)=\Omega ^{0}(M,V)\otimes _{\Omega ^{0}(M)}\Omega ^{p}(M),} and that because R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is a sub-ring of Ω 0 ( M ) via the constant functions, Ω Ω 0 ( M , V ) ⊗ ⊗ Ω Ω 0 ( M ) Ω Ω p ( M ) = ( V ⊗ ⊗ R Ω Ω 0 ( M ) ) ⊗ ⊗ Ω Ω 0 ( M ) Ω Ω p ( M ) = V ⊗ ⊗ R ( Ω Ω 0 ( M ) ⊗ ⊗ Ω Ω 0 ( M ) Ω Ω p ( M ) ) = V ⊗ ⊗ R Ω Ω p ( M ) .

{\displaystyle \Omega ^{0}(M,V)\otimes _{\Omega ^{0}(M)}\Omega ^{p}(M)=(V\otimes _{\mathbb {R} }\Omega ^{0}(M))\otimes _{\Omega ^{0}(M)}\Omega ^{p}(M)=V\otimes _{\mathbb {R} }(\Omega ^{0}(M)\otimes _{\Omega ^{0}(M)}\Omega ^{p}(M))=V\otimes _{\mathbb {R} }\Omega ^{p}(M).} ^ Proof: D ( f ϕ ϕ ) = D f ⊗ ⊗ ϕ ϕ + f D ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle D(f\phi )=Df\otimes \phi +fD\phi } for any scalar-valued tensorial zero-form f and any tensorial zero-form φ of type ρ, and Df = df since f descends to a function on M ; cf. this Lemma 2 .
