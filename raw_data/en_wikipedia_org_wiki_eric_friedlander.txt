Biography [ edit ] Friedlander was born on January 7, 1944 in Santurce , Puerto Rico .

[ 1 ] He graduated from Swarthmore College with bachelor's degree in 1965 and in 1970 received a Ph.D.

from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , under the supervision of Michael Artin , ( Fibrations in Étale Homotopy Theory ).

[ 2 ] He was a postdoctoral instructor at Princeton University : a lecturer in 1971 and assistant professor in 1972. From 1973 to 1974, he was, through the US exchange program, at France, in particular at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques . In 1975, he became an associate professor and in 1980 a professor at Northwestern University , where he was a chairman of the mathematics department from 1987 to 1990 and from 1999 to 2003. In 1999, he became Henry S. Noyes Professor of mathematics. As of 2008, he is Dean's Professor at the University of Southern California .

In 1981 and from 1985 to 1986, he was at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He received the Humboldt Research Award , while at the University of Heidelberg, from 1996 to 1998. He was also a visiting scholar and visiting professor at ETH Zurich , at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn , at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute , in Oxford, Cambridge, Paris, at Brown University , the Hebrew University , and at the Institut Henri Poincaré . Since 2000, he has been on the Board of Trustees of the American Mathematical Society .

Friedlander is a co-editor of the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra . In 1998, he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin ( Geometry of infinitesimal group schemes ).

[ 3 ] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 4 ] Friedlander is married to another mathematician, Susan Friedlander .
