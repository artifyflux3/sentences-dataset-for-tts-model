[ 1 ] In the case of two orbiting bodies it is the vector product of their relative position and relative linear momentum , divided by the mass of the body in question.

Specific relative angular momentum plays a pivotal role in the analysis of the two-body problem , as it remains constant for a given orbit under ideal conditions. " Specific " in this context indicates angular momentum per unit mass. The SI unit for specific relative angular momentum is square meter per second.

Definition [ edit ] The specific relative angular momentum is defined as the cross product of the relative position vector r {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} } and the relative velocity vector v {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} } .

h = r × × v = L m {\displaystyle \mathbf {h} =\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {v} ={\frac {\mathbf {L} }{m}}} where L {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} } is the angular momentum vector, defined as r × × m v {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} \times m\mathbf {v} } .

The h {\displaystyle \mathbf {h} } vector is always perpendicular to the instantaneous osculating orbital plane , which coincides with the instantaneous perturbed orbit . It is not necessarily perpendicular to the average orbital plane over time.

Proof of constancy in the two body case [ edit ] Distance vector r {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} } , velocity vector v {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} } , true anomaly θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } and flight path angle ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } of m 2 {\displaystyle m_{2}} in orbit around m 1 {\displaystyle m_{1}} . The most important measures of the ellipse are also depicted (among which, note that the true anomaly θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } is labeled as ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } ).

Under certain conditions, it can be proven that the specific angular momentum is constant. The conditions for this proof include: The mass of one object is much greater than the mass of the other one. ( m 1 ≫ ≫ m 2 {\displaystyle m_{1}\gg m_{2}} ) The coordinate system is inertial .

Each object can be treated as a spherically symmetrical point mass .

No other forces act on the system other than the gravitational force that connects the two bodies.

Proof [ edit ] The proof starts with the two body equation of motion , derived from Newton's law of universal gravitation : r ¨ ¨ + G m 1 r 2 r r = 0 {\displaystyle {\ddot {\mathbf {r} }}+{\frac {Gm_{1}}{r^{2}}}{\frac {\mathbf {r} }{r}}=0} where: r {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} } is the position vector from m 1 {\displaystyle m_{1}} to m 2 {\displaystyle m_{2}} with scalar magnitude r {\displaystyle r} .

r ¨ ¨ {\displaystyle {\ddot {\mathbf {r} }}} is the second time derivative of r {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} } . (the acceleration ) G {\displaystyle G} is the Gravitational constant .

The cross product of the position vector with the equation of motion is: r × × r ¨ ¨ + r × × G m 1 r 2 r r = 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} \times {\ddot {\mathbf {r} }}+\mathbf {r} \times {\frac {Gm_{1}}{r^{2}}}{\frac {\mathbf {r} }{r}}=0} Because r × × r = 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {r} =0} the second term vanishes: r × × r ¨ ¨ = 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} \times {\ddot {\mathbf {r} }}=0} It can also be derived that: d d t ( r × × r ˙ ˙ ) = r ˙ ˙ × × r ˙ ˙ + r × × r ¨ ¨ = r × × r ¨ ¨ {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\left(\mathbf {r} \times {\dot {\mathbf {r} }}\right)={\dot {\mathbf {r} }}\times {\dot {\mathbf {r} }}+\mathbf {r} \times {\ddot {\mathbf {r} }}=\mathbf {r} \times {\ddot {\mathbf {r} }}} Combining these two equations gives: d d t ( r × × r ˙ ˙ ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\left(\mathbf {r} \times {\dot {\mathbf {r} }}\right)=0} Since the time derivative is equal to zero, the quantity r × × r ˙ ˙ {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} \times {\dot {\mathbf {r} }}} is constant. Using the velocity vector v {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} } in place of the rate of change of position, and h {\displaystyle \mathbf {h} } for the specific angular momentum: h = r × × v {\displaystyle \mathbf {h} =\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {v} } is constant.

This is different from the normal construction of momentum, r × × p {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {p} } , because it does not include the mass of the object in question.

Kepler's laws of planetary motion [ edit ] Main article: Kepler's laws of planetary motion Kepler's laws of planetary motion can be proved almost directly with the above relationships.

First law [ edit ] The proof starts again with the equation of the two-body problem. This time the cross product is multiplied with the specific relative angular momentum r ¨ ¨ × × h = − − μ μ r 2 r r × × h {\displaystyle {\ddot {\mathbf {r} }}\times \mathbf {h} =-{\frac {\mu }{r^{2}}}{\frac {\mathbf {r} }{r}}\times \mathbf {h} } The left hand side is equal to the derivative d d t ( r ˙ ˙ × × h ) {\textstyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\left({\dot {\mathbf {r} }}\times \mathbf {h} \right)} because the angular momentum is constant.

After some steps (which includes using the vector triple product and defining the scalar r ˙ ˙ {\displaystyle {\dot {r}}} to be the radial velocity , as opposed to the norm of the vector r ˙ ˙ {\displaystyle {\dot {\mathbf {r} }}} ) the right hand side becomes: − − μ μ r 3 ( r × × h ) = − − μ μ r 3 ( ( r ⋅ ⋅ v ) r − − r 2 v ) = − − ( μ μ r 2 r ˙ ˙ r − − μ μ r v ) = μ μ d d t ( r r ) {\displaystyle -{\frac {\mu }{r^{3}}}\left(\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {h} \right)=-{\frac {\mu }{r^{3}}}\left(\left(\mathbf {r} \cdot \mathbf {v} \right)\mathbf {r} -r^{2}\mathbf {v} \right)=-\left({\frac {\mu }{r^{2}}}{\dot {r}}\mathbf {r} -{\frac {\mu }{r}}\mathbf {v} \right)=\mu {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\left({\frac {\mathbf {r} }{r}}\right)} Setting these two expression equal and integrating over time leads to (with the constant of integration C {\displaystyle \mathbf {C} } ) r ˙ ˙ × × h = μ μ r r + C {\displaystyle {\dot {\mathbf {r} }}\times \mathbf {h} =\mu {\frac {\mathbf {r} }{r}}+\mathbf {C} } Now this equation is multiplied ( dot product ) with r {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} } and rearranged r ⋅ ⋅ ( r ˙ ˙ × × h ) = r ⋅ ⋅ ( μ μ r r + C ) ⇒ ⇒ ( r × × r ˙ ˙ ) ⋅ ⋅ h = μ μ r + r C cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ⇒ ⇒ h 2 = μ μ r + r C cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {r} \cdot \left({\dot {\mathbf {r} }}\times \mathbf {h} \right)&=\mathbf {r} \cdot \left(\mu {\frac {\mathbf {r} }{r}}+\mathbf {C} \right)\\\Rightarrow \left(\mathbf {r} \times {\dot {\mathbf {r} }}\right)\cdot \mathbf {h} &=\mu r+rC\cos \theta \\\Rightarrow h^{2}&=\mu r+rC\cos \theta \end{aligned}}} Finally one gets the orbit equation [ 1 ] r = h 2 μ μ 1 + C μ μ cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle r={\frac {\frac {h^{2}}{\mu }}{1+{\frac {C}{\mu }}\cos \theta }}} which is the equation of a conic section in polar coordinates with semi-latus rectum p = h 2 μ μ {\textstyle p={\frac {h^{2}}{\mu }}} and eccentricity e = C μ μ {\textstyle e={\frac {C}{\mu }}} .

Second law [ edit ] The second law follows instantly from the second of the three equations to calculate the absolute value of the specific relative angular momentum.

[ 1 ] If one connects this form of the equation d t = r 2 h d θ θ {\textstyle \mathrm {d} t={\frac {r^{2}}{h}}\,\mathrm {d} \theta } with the relationship d A = r 2 2 d θ θ {\textstyle \mathrm {d} A={\frac {r^{2}}{2}}\,\mathrm {d} \theta } for the area of a sector with an infinitesimal small angle d θ θ {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \theta } (triangle with one very small side), the equation d t = 2 h d A {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} t={\frac {2}{h}}\,\mathrm {d} A} Third law [ edit ] Kepler's third is a direct consequence of the second law. Integrating over one revolution gives the orbital period [ 1 ] T = 2 π π a b h {\displaystyle T={\frac {2\pi ab}{h}}} for the area π π a b {\displaystyle \pi ab} of an ellipse. Replacing the semi-minor axis with b = a p {\displaystyle b={\sqrt {ap}}} and the specific relative angular momentum with h = μ μ p {\displaystyle h={\sqrt {\mu p}}} one gets T = 2 π π a 3 μ μ {\displaystyle T=2\pi {\sqrt {\frac {a^{3}}{\mu }}}} There is thus a relationship between the semi-major axis and the orbital period of a satellite that can be reduced to a constant of the central body.
