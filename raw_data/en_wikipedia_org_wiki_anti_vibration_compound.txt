Find sources: "Anti-vibration compound" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2009 ) An anti-vibration compound is a temperature-resistant mixture of a liquid with fine particles, which is used to reduce oscillations in calender rolls
and to dampen vibrations in fabricated structures like machine beds and housings.

[ 1 ] Use [ edit ] Vibration may limit the performance of a calender or paper machine . It can have numerous sources such as bulk variations in the sheet, bearing problems, or misalignment of the driveshaft .  Vibration manifests itself as a high frequency periodic movement of the roll body with an amplitude from less than one to several μm.

When anti-vibration compound is introduced to the center bores of the rolls, vibration is transferred from the solid roll structure to the incompressible fluid component of the anti-vibration compound. Its solid particles are less mobile due to their inertia . Thus the fluid is forced to oscillate around the solid components. The flow energy is absorbed by micro eddies by which the vibration is damped.

The benefits are a smoother running with increased operating speed and production, longer operating times of the polymer covers between re-grindings and improved product quality due to the reduction of barring.
