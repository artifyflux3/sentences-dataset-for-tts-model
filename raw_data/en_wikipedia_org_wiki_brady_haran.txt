**Brady John Haran**[OAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia "Medal of the Order of Australia") (born 18 June 1976) is an [Australian-British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians_in_the_United_Kingdom "Australians in the United Kingdom")[independent filmmaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film "Independent film") and [video journalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_journalism "Video journalism") who produces [educational videos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_film "Educational film") and documentary films for his [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube "YouTube") channels, the most notable being _Computerphile_ and _[Numberphile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numberphile "Numberphile")_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-BOOK_1-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-2) Haran is also the co-host of the _[Hello Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello\_Internet "Hello Internet")_[podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast "Podcast") along with fellow educational [YouTuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTubers "YouTubers")[CGP Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGP_Grey "CGP Grey"). On 22 August 2017, Haran launched his second podcast, called _The Unmade Podcast_, and on 11 November 2018, he launched his third podcast, _[The Numberphile Podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Numberphile\_Podcast "The Numberphile Podcast")_, based on his mathematics-centered channel of the same name.

Reporter and filmmaker
----------------------

Brady Haran studied journalism for a year before being hired by _[The Adelaide Advertiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Adelaide\_Advertiser "The Adelaide Advertiser")_. In 2002, he moved from Australia to [Nottingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham "Nottingham"), United Kingdom. In Nottingham, he worked for the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC"), began to work with film, and reported for _[East Midlands Today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East\_Midlands\_Today "East Midlands Today")_, [BBC News Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News_Online "BBC News Online") and BBC radio stations.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-IMPACT_1-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-BBC_iCan-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-5)

In 2007, Haran worked as a filmmaker-in-residence for Nottingham Science City,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-IMPACT_1-3)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-Nottingham_1-6) as part of an agreement between the BBC and the [University of Nottingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham "University of Nottingham").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-TEST_TUBE_1-7) His "Test Tube" project started with the idea of producing a documentary about scientists and their research, but he decided to upload his raw footage to YouTube; from that point "Periodic Videos" and "Sixty Symbols" were developed.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-IMPACT_1-3)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-Nottingham_1-6) Haran then left the BBC to work full-time making YouTube videos.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-NEWS.COM.AU_1-8)

YouTube channels
----------------

Following _Test Tube_, Haran decided to create new YouTube channels.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-IMPACT_1-3) In his first five years as an independent filmmaker he made over 1500 videos[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-NEWS.COM.AU_1-8) and in 2012, he was the producer, editor, and interviewer behind 12 YouTube channels. Haran frequently collaborates with well-known academics and professionals. Haran's videos are often in the format of a casual interview in which Haran and an expert discuss subjects relevant to their work.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-TenEighty-9)

### _The Periodic Table of Videos_

Started in June 2008, _Periodic Videos_ is a series of videos about [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_elements "Chemical elements") and the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table "Periodic table"). Working with Professor [Martyn Poliakoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyn_Poliakoff "Martyn Poliakoff"), Haran's videos explaining chemistry and science for non-technical persons have received positive recognition.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-BOOK_1-1) Together, they have made over 500 short videos that cover the elements and other chemistry-related topics. Their YouTube channel has had more than 159 million views.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-10) Also, Haran and Poliakoff authored an article in the _[Nature Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature\_Chemistry "Nature Chemistry")_ journal[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-11) and an essay on [_Science_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal) "Science (journal)") journal[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-12) discussing the impact of _The Periodic Table of Videos_. Martyn Poliakoff received the [Royal Society of Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Chemistry "Royal Society of Chemistry")[Nyholm Prize for Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Sydney_Nyholm "Ronald Sydney Nyholm") in 2011 for work taking chemistry education to a wider audience; this included his work with Haran on _The Periodic Table of Videos_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-13)

### _Sixty Symbols_

_Sixty Symbols_ is Haran's YouTube channel for [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"). The first video was released in April 2009, with the original run of videos focusing on [commonly used physics notations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_physics_notations "List of common physics notations").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-60Symbols-14) Since then, videos on topics such as the [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect "Greenhouse effect"), the [age of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe "Age of the universe"), and several on [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_holes "Black holes") have been released.

### _Numberphile_

Started in October 2011,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-NumFirstVideo-15)_Numberphile_ features videos that explore educational topics from a variety of [fields of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_of_mathematics "Fields of mathematics"). It is currently Haran's most subscribed channel. In the early days of the channel, each video focused on a specific number, but the channel has since expanded its scope, featuring videos on more advanced mathematical concepts such as [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem "Fermat's Last Theorem") and the [Riemann hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis "Riemann hypothesis"). Haran maintains the _Numberphile2_ channel as well, which features extra footage from the main channel, as well as _The Numberphile Podcast_.

### _Objectivity_

Haran launched the YouTube channel _Objectivity_ in late 2014. The videos feature the discussion and handling of historic objects and manuscripts, often from the archives of the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society"), though other historic museums and organizations have also been featured. Haran is the on-camera presenter for the channel, in contrast to his other channels where he is a behind-the-camera presence. Keith Moore, the Head Librarian of the Royal Society, is prominently featured.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-FutureObjectivity-16)

### _Deep Sky Videos_

_Deep Sky Videos_, started in October 2011, is Haran's astronomy-focused channel.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-FirstDeepSky-17) It is similarly formatted and has some of the same contributors as _Numberphile_ and _Sixty Symbols_. In September 2022, the channel finished a series of videos on each of the 110 [Messier objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object "Messier object"), which had been a goal of the channel since January 2012.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-DeepSkyMessierIntro-18)

### Other YouTube channels

_Computerphile_ is the sister channel to _Numberphile_, featuring videos about [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"). Haran is minimally involved in the channel's video creation, with most being directed and produced by Sean Riley.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-Projects-19)

Haran continues to maintain the _Test Tube_ channel, now titled _nottinghamscience_, as a place to post extra footage and outtakes from _Periodic Videos_ and _Sixty Symbols_. He also runs channels for his podcasts _Hello Internet_ and _The Unmade Podcast_. Haran has several channels that have been inactive for several years, which are _Words of the World_, _Backstage Science_, _Psyfile_, _PhilosophyFile_, _Bibledex_, _FavScientist_, and _foodskey_. _Brady Stuff_ is Haran's channel for personal videos and is a self-described "dumping ground for clips that don't quite fit anywhere".[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-BradyStuffAbout-20)

Podcasts

### _Hello Internet_

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Hello_Internet_Logo.svg/250px-Hello_Internet_Logo.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hello_Internet_Logo.svg)

Hello Internet logo

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Nail_%26_Gear.svg/250px-Nail_%26_Gear.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nail_%26_Gear.svg)

Nail & Gear – chosen by the listeners in a [postal referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting "Postal voting") as the official flag of the _Hello Internet_ podcast[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-21)

In January 2014, Haran launched the podcast _Hello Internet_ along with co-host [CGP Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGP_Grey "CGP Grey"), another YouTube educational content creator. The podcast peaked as the #1 [iTunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes "ITunes") podcast in the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, Canada, and Australia.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-rank-22) It was selected as one of [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.")'s best new podcasts of 2014.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-23)_[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Guardian "The Guardian")_ included the podcast among its 50 best of 2016, naming episode 66 ("A Classic Episode") its episode of the year. The paper described the podcast as having "in-depth debates and banter that is actually amusing".[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-24)

The podcast features discussions pertaining to their lives as professional content creators for YouTube, as well as their interests and annoyances. Typical topics include technology etiquette; movie and TV show reviews; plane accidents; [vexillology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology "Vexillology"); [futurology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_studies "Futures studies"); and the differences between Grey's and Haran's personalities and lifestyles.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-25) Grey's and Haran's opinions and comments on feedback usually starts the next episode of the podcast. As a result of their conversations, Haran has been noted for reappropriating the term "[freebooting](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/freebooting "wikt:freebooting")", among other words, to refer to the unauthorised rehosting of online media.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-freebooting-26)

The podcast has an "official" flag called the Nail & Gear which was chosen from five candidates with a [postal vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting "Postal voting") by the podcast's audience using an [alternative vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_vote "Alternative vote") system.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-29)

The podcast is currently on indefinite hiatus.

### _The Unmade Podcast_

In August 2017, Haran launched _The Unmade Podcast_ along with co-host Tim Hein, a close friend of Haran.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-:0-30) The podcast features a discussion between the two about "ideas for podcasts that they will never make".[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-:0-30) Most episodes last for approximately 40–75 minutes and each host is given the opportunity to pitch two podcast ideas in total. Hein and Haran then proceed to discuss these ideas in a light-hearted and often comedic manner. Along with the regular episodes, the podcast also has occasional 'special episodes'. These are usually, but not always, an opportunity for the hosts to attempt to actually create a podcast from an idea previously put forward on the show. A notable exception to this was the Antarctica special episode which departed from the usual format for Haran to discuss his recent visit to Antarctica with Hein.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-31) As of December 2020, there have been twenty special episodes including the Antarctica special.

### _The Numberphile Podcast_

In November 2018, Haran launched _The Numberphile Podcast_, in which he speaks with various mathematicians in a longer-form version than the YouTube channel.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-h562-32) Unlike with his others, Haran is the sole host of this podcast.

### _Younglings_

In January 2023, Haran launched the podcast _Younglings_ with his wife [Kylie Pentelow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Pentelow "Kylie Pentelow"), journalist [Amanda Knox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Knox "Amanda Knox"), and her husband Christopher Robinson. The podcast focuses on the two couples' experience with parenthood, as well as advice for new parents.

Personal life
-------------

Haran lives near [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol "Bristol") in the UK. He is married to journalist and TV news presenter [Kylie Pentelow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Pentelow "Kylie Pentelow"), with whom he has a son.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran#cite_note-33)
