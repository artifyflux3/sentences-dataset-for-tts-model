[ 8 ] Website www2 .physics .ox .ac .uk /contacts /people /bellburnell Dame Susan Jocelyn Bell Burnell ( / b ɜːr ˈ n ɛ l / ; née Bell ; born 15 July 1943) is a Northern Irish physicist who, while conducting research for her doctorate, discovered the first radio pulsars in 1967.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] This discovery later earned the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974, but she was not among the awardees.

[ 11 ] Bell Burnell was president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 2002 to 2004, president of the Institute of Physics from October 2008 until October 2010, and interim president of the Institute following the death of her successor, Marshall Stoneham , in early 2011. She was Chancellor of the University of Dundee from 2018 to 2023.

In 2018, she was awarded the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics . Following the announcement of the award, she decided to use the $3 million (£2.3 million) prize money to establish a fund to help female, minority and refugee students to become research physicists. The fund is administered by the Institute of Physics .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In 2021, Bell Burnell became the second female recipient (after Dorothy Hodgkin in 1976) of the Copley Medal .

[ 16 ] In 2025, Bell Burnell's image was included on an An Post stamp celebrating women in STEM .

[ 17 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Jocelyn Bell, June 1967 Bell Burnell was born in Lurgan , County Armagh , Northern Ireland, to M. Allison and G. Philip Bell.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 1 ] Their country home was called "Solitude" and she grew up there with her younger brother and two younger sisters.

[ 18 ] Her father was an architect who helped design the Armagh Planetarium , [ 19 ] and during her visits there, the staff encouraged her to pursue a career in astronomy.

[ 20 ] She also enjoyed her father's books on astronomy .

She grew up in Lurgan and attended the Preparatory Department [ a ] of Lurgan College from 1948 to 1956.

[ 2 ] At the time, boys could study technical subjects, but girls were expected to study subjects such as cooking and cross-stitching . Bell Burnell was able to study science only after her parents and others challenged the school's policies.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] She failed the eleven-plus exam and her parents sent her to The Mount School , [ 1 ] a Quaker girls' boarding school in York , England, where she completed her secondary education in 1961.

[ 18 ] There she was favourably impressed by her physics teacher, Mr. Tillott, and stated: You do not have to learn lots and lots ... of facts; you just learn a few key things, and ... then you can apply and build and develop from those ... He was a really good teacher and showed me, actually, how easy physics was.

[ 24 ] She next joined the University of Glasgow , where in 1965 she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Natural Philosophy (physics), with honours, and then New Hall, Cambridge , where she gained a PhD in 1969.

[ 1 ] At Cambridge, she worked with Antony Hewish and others to construct [ b ] the Interplanetary Scintillation Array just outside Cambridge to study quasars , which had recently been discovered.

[ c ] Career and research [ edit ] Chart on which Burnell first recognised evidence of a pulsar , exhibited at Cambridge University Library Composite Optical/X-ray image of the Crab Nebula , showing synchrotron emission in the surrounding pulsar wind nebula , powered by injection of magnetic fields and particles from the central pulsar Bell Burnell attends the American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting at Pasadena, California, 5 January 1987 On 28 November 1967, while a postgraduate student at Cambridge, Bell Burnell detected a "bit of scruff" on her chart-recorder papers that tracked across the sky with the stars. The signal had been visible in data taken in August, but as the papers had to be checked by hand, it took her three months to find it.

[ 25 ] She established that the signal was pulsing with great regularity, at a rate of about one pulse every one and a third seconds. Temporarily dubbed "Little Green Man 1" (LGM-1) the source (now known as PSR B1919+21 ) was identified after several years as a rapidly rotating neutron star . This was later documented by the BBC Horizon series.

[ 26 ] In a 2020 lecture at Harvard , she related how the media was covering the discovery of pulsars, with interviews taking a standard "disgusting" format: Hewish would be asked on the astrophysics, and she would be the "human interest" part, asked about vital statistics, how many boyfriends she had, what colour is her hair, and asked to undo some buttons for the photographs.

[ 27 ] The Daily Telegraph science reporter shortened "pulsating radio source" to pulsar .

[ 27 ] She worked at the University of Southampton between 1968 and 1973, University College London from 1974 to 82 and the Royal Observatory , Edinburgh (1982–91). From 1973 to 1987 she was a tutor, consultant, examiner, and lecturer for the Open University .

[ 28 ] In 1986, she became the project manager for the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope on Mauna Kea , Hawaii, a position she held until 1991.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] She was Professor of Physics at the Open University from 1991 to 2001. She was also a visiting professor at Princeton University in the United States and Dean of Science at the University of Bath (2001–04), [ 31 ] and President of the Royal Astronomical Society between 2002 and 2004.

Bell Burnell was visiting professor of astrophysics at the University of Oxford , and a Fellow of Mansfield College in 2007.

[ 32 ] She was President of the Institute of Physics between 2008 and 2010.

[ 33 ] In 2013, Bell Burnell was elected Pro-Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin .

[ 34 ] In February 2018 she was appointed Chancellor of the University of Dundee .

[ 35 ] In 2018, Bell Burnell visited Parkes, NSW , to deliver the keynote John Bolton lecture at the Central West Astronomical Society (CWAS) AstroFest event.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] Nobel Prize controversy [ edit ] Controversially, Bell did not receive recognition in the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics . She helped build the Interplanetary Scintillation Array over two years [ 8 ] and initially noticed the anomaly, sometimes reviewing as much as 96 feet (29 m) of paper data per night. Bell later said that she had to be persistent in reporting the anomaly in the face of scepticism from Hewish, who initially insisted it was due to interference and man-made. She spoke of meetings held by Hewish and Ryle to which she was not invited.

[ 38 ] [ 23 ] The paper announcing the discovery of pulsars had five authors. Bell's thesis supervisor Antony Hewish [ 5 ] [ 6 ] was listed first, Bell second. Hewish was awarded the Nobel Prize, along with the astronomer Martin Ryle . At the time fellow astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle criticised Bell's omission.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] In 1977, Bell Burnell commented: I believe it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them.

[ 42 ] The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , in its press release announcing the prize, [ 43 ] cited Ryle and Hewish for their pioneering work in radio-astrophysics, with particular mention of Ryle's work on aperture-synthesis technique and Hewish's decisive role in the discovery of pulsars.

Feryal Özel , an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona, characterized Bell Burnell's contributions as follows: She helped build the array she used to make the observation. She is the one who noticed it. She is the one who argued it's a real signal. When a graduate student takes that kind of lead in her project, it's hard to play it down.

[ 13 ] In later years, she opined that "the fact that I was a graduate student and a woman, together, demoted my standing in terms of receiving a Nobel prize." [ 23 ] The decision continues to be debated to this day .

Personal and non-academic life [ edit ] Bell Burnell is house patron of Burnell House at Cambridge House Grammar School in Ballymena , County Antrim . She has campaigned to improve the status and number of women in professional and academic posts in the fields of physics and astronomy.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] Quaker activities and beliefs [ edit ] From her school days, she has been an active Quaker and served as Clerk to the sessions of Britain Yearly Meeting in 1995, 1996 and 1997. Bell Burnell also served as Clerk of the Central Executive Committee of Friends World Committee for Consultation from 2008 to 2012. She delivered a Swarthmore Lecture under the title Broken for Life , [ 89 ] at Yearly Meeting in Aberdeen on 1 August 1989, and was the plenary speaker at the US Friends General Conference Gathering in 2000.

[ 90 ] She spoke of her personal religious history and beliefs in an interview with Joan Bakewell in 2006.

[ 91 ] Bell Burnell served on the Quaker Peace and Social Witness Testimonies Committee, which produced Engaging with the Quaker Testimonies: a Toolkit in February 2007.

[ 92 ] In 2013, she gave a James Backhouse Lecture which was published in a book entitled A Quaker Astronomer Reflects: Can a Scientist Also Be Religious?

, in which Burnell reflects about how cosmological knowledge can be related to what the Bible, Quakerism or Christian faith states.

[ 93 ] Marriage [ edit ] In 1968, between the discovery of the second and third pulsar, Bell became engaged to Martin Burnell and they married soon after; the couple divorced in 1993 after separating in 1989.  In a 2021 online lecture at the University of Bedfordshire , Bell Burnell reflected on her first experience returning to the observatory wearing an engagement ring. Though she was proud of her ring, she said wearing it was a mistake, as, at the time, if a married women worked it implied her husband was incapable of providing, which was shameful.

[ 94 ] Her husband was a local government officer, and his career took them to various parts of Britain. She worked part-time for many years while raising their son, Gavin Burnell, who is a member of the condensed matter physics group at the University of Leeds .
