It is one of the four extant East Slavic languages, [ e ] and is the native language of the Russians . It was the de facto and de jure [ f ] official language of the former Soviet Union .

[ 21 ] Russian has remained an official language of the Russian Federation , Belarus , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , and Tajikistan , and is still commonly used as a lingua franca in Ukraine , Moldova , the Caucasus , Central Asia , and to a lesser extent in the Baltic states and Israel .

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Russian has over 253 million total speakers worldwide.

[ 1 ] It is the most spoken native language in Europe , [ 26 ] the most spoken Slavic language , [ 27 ] and the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia .

[ 27 ] It is the world's seventh-most spoken language by number of native speakers , and the world's ninth-most spoken language by total number of speakers .

[ 28 ] Russian is one of two official languages aboard the International Space Station , [ 29 ] one of the six official languages of the United Nations , [ 30 ] as well as the fourth most widely used language on the Internet .

[ 31 ] Russian is written using the Russian alphabet of the Cyrillic script ; it distinguishes between consonant phonemes with palatal secondary articulation and those without—the so-called "soft" and "hard" sounds. Almost every consonant has a hard or soft counterpart, and the distinction is a prominent feature of the language, which is usually shown in writing not by a change of the consonant but rather by changing the following vowel. Another important aspect is the reduction of unstressed vowels .

Stress , which is often unpredictable, is not normally indicated orthographically , [ 32 ] though an optional acute accent may be used to mark stress – such as to distinguish between homographic words (e.g.

замо́к [ zamók , 'lock'] and за́мок [ zámok , 'castle']), or to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words or proper nouns.

Classification Russian is an East Slavic language of the wider Indo-European family .

[ 33 ] Old East Slavic (or Old Russian) is the parent language of the modern Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian languages.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] In many places in eastern and southern Ukraine and throughout Belarus, these languages are spoken interchangeably, and in certain areas traditional bilingualism resulted in language mixtures such as surzhyk in eastern Ukraine and trasianka in Belarus. The Novgorod dialect , a historical variety of Russian with unique northwestern dialectal features, is sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the formation of modern Russian.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] Also, Russian has notable lexical similarities with Bulgarian due to a common Church Slavonic influence on both languages, but because of later interaction in the 19th and 20th centuries, Bulgarian grammar differs markedly from Russian.

[ 38 ] Over the course of centuries, the vocabulary and literary style of Russian have also been influenced by Western and Central European languages such as Greek, Latin , Polish , Dutch , German, French, Italian, and English, [ 39 ] and to a lesser extent the languages to the south and the east: Uralic , Turkic , [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Persian , [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Arabic , and Hebrew .

[ 44 ] According to the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California , Russian is classified as a level III language in terms of learning difficulty for native English speakers, requiring approximately 1,100 hours of immersion instruction to achieve intermediate fluency.

[ 45 ] Standard Russian Main article: Moscow dialect Feudal divisions and conflicts created obstacles between the Russian principalities before and especially during Mongol rule. This strengthened dialectal differences, and for a while, prevented the emergence of a standardized national language. The formation of the unified and centralized Russian state in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the gradual re-emergence of a common political, economic, and cultural space created the need for a common standard language. The initial impulse for standardization came from the government bureaucracy for the lack of a reliable tool of communication in administrative, legal, and judicial affairs became an obvious practical problem. The earliest attempts at standardizing Russian were made based on the so-called Moscow official or chancery language, during the 15th to 17th centuries.

[ 46 ] Since then, the trend of language policy in Russia has been standardization in both the restricted sense of reducing dialectical barriers between ethnic Russians, and the broader sense of expanding the use of Russian alongside or in favour of other languages.

[ 46 ] The current standard form of Russian is generally regarded as the modern Russian literary language ( современный русский литературный язык , sovremenny russky literaturny yazyk ), or Contemporary Standard Russian .

[ 47 ] It arose at the beginning of the 18th century with the modernization reforms of the Russian state under the rule of Peter the Great and developed from the Moscow ( Middle or Central Russian ) dialect substratum under some influence of the Russian chancery language.

[ 46 ] The Moscow dialect had a northern dialectal base, but after Moscow became the center of a unified state, the attraction of southern dialectal speakers led to the emergence of a transitional dialect group.

[ 48 ] Prior to the Bolshevik Revolution , the spoken form of the Russian language was that of the nobility and the urban bourgeoisie. Russian peasants, the great majority of the population, continued to speak in their own dialects. However, the peasants' speech was never systematically studied, as it was generally regarded by philologists as simply a source of folklore and an object of curiosity.

[ 49 ] This was acknowledged by the noted Russian dialectologist Nikolai Karinsky , who toward the end of his life wrote: "Scholars of Russian dialects mostly studied phonetics and morphology. Some scholars and collectors compiled local dictionaries. We have almost no studies of lexical material or the syntax of Russian dialects." [ 50 ] After 1917, Marxist linguists had no interest in the multiplicity of peasant dialects and regarded their language as a relic of the rapidly disappearing past that was not worthy of scholarly attention. Nakhimovsky quotes the Soviet academicians A.M Ivanov and L.P Yakubinsky, writing in 1930: The language of peasants has a motley diversity inherited from feudalism. On its way to becoming proletariat peasantry brings to the factory and the industrial plant their local peasant dialects with their phonetics, grammar, and vocabulary, and the very process of recruiting workers from peasants and the mobility of the worker population generate another process: the liquidation of peasant inheritance by way of leveling the particulars of local dialects. On the ruins of peasant multilingual, in the context of developing heavy industry, a qualitatively new entity can be said to emerge—the general language of the working class... capitalism has the tendency of creating the general urban language of a given society.

[ 51 ] Geographic distribution Main article: Geographical distribution of Russian speakers Hemisphere view of countries where Russian is an official language and countries where it is spoken as a first or second language by at least 30% of the population but is not an official language Competence of Russian in countries of the former Soviet Union (except Russia), 2004 In 2010, there were 259.8 million speakers of Russian in the world: in Russia – 137.5 million, in the CIS and Baltic countries – 93.7 million, in Eastern Europe – 12.9 million, Western Europe – 7.3 million, Asia – 2.7 million, in the Middle East and North Africa – 1.3 million, Sub-Saharan Africa – 0.1 million, Latin America – 0.2 million, U.S., Canada , Australia, and New Zealand – 4.1 million speakers. Therefore, the Russian language is the seventh-largest in the world by the number of speakers , after English, Mandarin, Hindi -Urdu, Spanish, French, Arabic, and Portuguese.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Russian is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Education in Russian is still a popular choice for both Russian as a second language (RSL) and native speakers in Russia, and in many former Soviet republics. Russian is still seen as an important language for children to learn in most of the former Soviet republics.

[ 56 ] 77% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 67% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.

[ 57 ] According to the 2019 Belarusian census , out of 9,413,446 inhabitants of the country, 5,094,928 (54.1% of the total population) named Belarusian as their native language, with 61.2% of ethnic Belarusians and 54.5% of ethnic Poles declaring Belarusian as their native language. In everyday life in the Belarusian society the Russian language prevails, so according to the 2019 census 6,718,557 people (71.4% of the total population) stated that they speak Russian at home, for ethnic Belarusians this share is 61.4%, for Russians — 97.2%, for Ukrainians — 89.0%, for Poles — 52.4%, and for Jews — 96.6%; 2,447,764 people (26.0% of the total population) stated that the language they usually speak at home is Belarusian, among ethnic Belarusians this share is 28.5%; the highest share of those who speak Belarusian at home is among ethnic Poles — 46.0%.

[ 58 ] In Estonia , Russian is spoken by 29.6% of the population, according to a 2011 estimate from the World Factbook, [ 59 ] and is officially considered a foreign language.

[ 56 ] School education in the Russian language is a very contentious point in Estonian politics, and in 2022, the parliament approved a bill to close up all Russian language schools and kindergartens by the school year.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] On 28 September 2023, Latvian deputies approved The National Security Concept, according to which from 1 January 2026, all content created by Latvian public media (including LSM ) should be only in Latvian or a language that "belongs to the European cultural space". The financing of Russian-language content by the state will cease, which the concept says create a "unified information space". However, one inevitable consequence would be the closure of public media broadcasts in Russian on LTV and Latvian Radio, as well as the closure of LSM's Russian-language service.

[ 68 ] In Lithuania , Russian has no official or legal status, but the use of the language has some presence in certain areas. A large part of the population, especially the older generations, can speak Russian as a foreign language.

[ 69 ] However, English has replaced Russian as lingua franca in Lithuania and around 80% of young people speak English as their first foreign language.

[ 70 ] In contrast to the other two Baltic states, Lithuania has a relatively small Russian-speaking minority (5.0% as of 2008 [update] ).

[ 57 ] On 5 September 2017, Ukraine's Parliament passed a new education law which requires all schools to teach at least partially in Ukrainian, with provisions while allow indigenous languages and languages of national minorities to be used alongside the national language.

[ 78 ] The law faced criticism from officials in Russia and Hungary.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] The 2019 Law of Ukraine "On protecting the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language" gives priority to the Ukrainian language in more than 30 spheres of public life: in particular in public administration , media, education, science, culture, advertising, services . The law does not regulate private communication.

[ 81 ] [ 82 ] A poll conducted in March 2022 by RATING in the territory controlled by Ukraine found that 83% of the respondents believe that Ukrainian should be the only state language of Ukraine. This opinion dominates in all macro-regions, age and language groups. On the other hand, before the war, almost a quarter of Ukrainians were in favour of granting Russian the status of the state language, while after the beginning of Russia's invasion the support for the idea dropped to just 7%. In peacetime, the idea of raising the status of Russian was traditionally supported by residents of the south and east . But even in these regions, only a third of the respondents were in favour, and after Russia's full-scale invasion , their number dropped by almost half.

[ 83 ] According to the survey carried out by RATING in August 2023 in the territory controlled by Ukraine and among the refugees, almost 60% of the polled usually speak Ukrainian at home, about 30% – Ukrainian and Russian, only 9% – Russian.

[ 97 ] North America See also: Russian language in the United States The Russian language was first introduced in North America when Russian explorers voyaged into Alaska and claimed it for Russia during the 18th century. Although most Russian colonists left after the United States bought the land in 1867, a handful stayed and preserved the Russian language in this region to this day, although only a few elderly speakers of this unique dialect are left.

[ 98 ] In Nikolaevsk, Alaska , Russian is more spoken than English. Sizable Russian-speaking communities also exist in North America, especially in large urban centers of the US and Canada, such as New York City , Philadelphia , Boston , Los Angeles , Nashville , San Francisco , Seattle , Spokane , Toronto , Calgary , Baltimore , Miami , Portland , Chicago , Denver , and Cleveland . In a number of locations they issue their own newspapers, and live in ethnic enclaves (especially the generation of immigrants who started arriving in the early 1960s). Only about 25% of them are ethnic Russians, however. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the overwhelming majority of Russophones in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn in New York City were Russian-speaking Jews. Afterward, the influx from the countries of the former Soviet Union changed the statistics somewhat, with ethnic Russians and Ukrainians immigrating along with some more Russian Jews and Central Asians. According to the United States Census , in 2007 Russian was the primary language spoken in the homes of over 850,000 individuals living in the United States.

Slobozhan and Steppe dialects of Ukrainian 14. Steppe dialect of Ukrainian with Russian influences ( Balachka ) Despite leveling after 1900, especially in matters of vocabulary and phonetics, a number of dialects still exist in Russia. Some linguists divide the dialects of Russian into two primary regional groupings, "Northern" and "Southern", with Moscow lying on the zone of transition between the two. Others divide the language into three groupings, Northern , Central (or Middle), and Southern , with Moscow lying in the Central region.

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ] The Northern Russian dialects and those spoken along the Volga River typically pronounce unstressed /o/ clearly, a phenomenon called okanye ( оканье ).

[ 104 ] Besides the absence of vowel reduction, some dialects have high or diphthongal /e⁓i̯ɛ/ in place of Proto-Slavic * ě and /o⁓u̯ɔ/ in stressed closed syllables (as in Ukrainian) instead of Standard Russian /e/ and /o/ , respectively.

[ 104 ] Another Northern dialectal morphological feature is a post-posed definite article -to , -ta , -te similar to that existing in Bulgarian and Macedonian.

[ 104 ] In the Southern Russian dialects , instances of unstressed /e/ and /a/ following palatalized consonants and preceding a stressed syllable are not reduced to [ɪ] (as occurs in the Moscow dialect), being instead pronounced [a] in such positions (e.g.

несл и is pronounced [nʲaˈslʲi] , not [nʲɪsˈlʲi] ) – this is called yakanye ( яканье ).

[ 104 ] [ 106 ] Consonants include a fricative /ɣ/ , a semivowel /w⁓u̯/ and /x⁓xv⁓xw/ , whereas the Standard and Northern dialects have the consonants /ɡ/ , /v/ , and final /l/ and /f/ , respectively.

[ 104 ] The morphology features a palatalized final /tʲ/ in 3rd person forms of verbs (this is unpalatalized in the Standard and Northern dialects).

[ 104 ] [ 107 ] Comparison with other Slavic languages During the Proto-Slavic (Common Slavic) times all Slavs spoke one mutually intelligible language or group of dialects.

[ 108 ] There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility between Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian , and a moderate degree of it in all modern Slavic languages, at least at the conversational level.

During the Russification of the aforementioned regions in the 1920s to 1950s, it was replaced by the Russian language.

Esperanto has some words of Russian and Slavic origin and some features of its grammar could be derived from Russian.

This word is also used by English speakers to describe the way in which Russians attempt to speak English using Russian morphology or syntax.

Russenorsk , an extinct pidgin language with mostly Russian vocabulary and mostly Norwegian grammar, used for communication between Russians and Norwegian traders in the Pomor trade in Finnmark and the Kola Peninsula Surzhyk , a range of mixed (macaronic) sociolects of Ukrainian and Russian languages used in certain regions of Ukraine and adjacent lands.

Printed by Ivan Fyodorov in 1574 in Lviv. This page features the Cyrillic script .

Russian is written using a Cyrillic alphabet. The early Cyrillic alphabet was adapted to Russian from Old Church Slavonic .

[ 113 ] The first attempt at reforming Russian orthography was carried out in 1708–1710.

[ 113 ] The last major reform was carried out in 1917–1918.

[ 113 ] The Russian alphabet consists of 33 letters. The following table gives their forms, along with IPA values for each letter's typical sound: А а /a/ Б б /b/ В в /v/ Г г /ɡ/ Д д /d/ Е е /je/ Ё ё /jo/ Ж ж /ʐ/ З з /z/ И и /i/ Й й /j/ К к /k/ Л л /l/ М м /m/ Н н /n/ О о /o/ П п /p/ Р р /r/ С с /s/ Т т /t/ У у /u/ Ф ф /f/ Х х /x/ Ц ц /ts/ Ч ч /tɕ/ Ш ш /ʂ/ Щ щ /ɕː/ Ъ ъ /-/ Ы ы /ɨ/ Ь ь /ʲ/ Э э /e/ Ю ю /ju/ Я я /ja/ Older letters of the Russian alphabet include ⟨ ѣ ⟩ , which merged to ⟨ е ⟩ ( /je/ or /ʲe/ ); ⟨ і ⟩ and ⟨ ѵ ⟩ , which both merged to ⟨ и ⟩ ( /i/ ); ⟨ ѳ ⟩ , which merged to ⟨ ф ⟩ ( /f/ ); ⟨ ѫ ⟩ , which merged to ⟨ у ⟩ ( /u/ ); ⟨ ѭ ⟩ , which merged to ⟨ ю ⟩ ( /ju/ or /ʲu/ ); and ⟨ ѧ ⟩ and ⟨ ѩ ⟩ , which later were graphically reshaped into ⟨ я ⟩ and merged phonetically to /ja/ or /ʲa/ . While these older letters have been abandoned at one time or another, they may be used in this and related articles. The yers ⟨ ъ ⟩ and ⟨ ь ⟩ originally indicated the pronunciation of ultra-short or reduced /ŭ/ , /ĭ/ .

Transliteration Further information: Romanization of Russian Because of many technical restrictions in computing and also because of the unavailability of Cyrillic keyboards abroad, Russian is often transliterated using the Latin alphabet. For example, мороз ('frost') is transliterated moroz , and мышь ('mouse'), mysh or myš ' . Once commonly used by the majority of those living outside Russia, transliteration is being used less frequently by Russian-speaking typists in favor of the extension of Unicode character encoding , which fully incorporates the Russian alphabet. Free programs are available offering this Unicode extension, which allow users to type Russian characters, even on Western 'QWERTY' keyboards.

[ 114 ] Computing Main article: History of computing in the Soviet Union The Russian language was first introduced to computing after the M-1 , and MESM models were produced in 1951.

[ 115 ] Orthography Main article: Russian orthography According to the Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an optional acute accent ( знак ударения ) may, and sometimes should, be used to mark stress . For example, it is used to distinguish between otherwise identical words, especially when context does not make it obvious: замо́к ( zamók – "lock") – за́мок ( zámok – "castle"), сто́ящий ( stóyashchy – "worthwhile") – стоя́щий ( stoyáshchy – "standing"), чудно́ ( chudnó – "this is odd") – чу́дно ( chúdno – "this is marvellous"), молоде́ц ( molodéts – "well done!") – мо́лодец ( mólodets – "fine young man"), узна́ю ( uznáyu – "I shall learn it") – узнаю́ ( uznayú – "I recognize it"), отреза́ть ( otrezát – "to be cutting") – отре́зать ( otrézat – "to have cut"); to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words, especially personal and family names, like афе́ра ( aféra , "scandal, affair"), гу́ру ( gúru , "guru"), Гарси́я ( García ), Оле́ша ( Olésha ), Фе́рми ( Fermi ), and to show which is the stressed word in a sentence, for example Ты́ съел печенье?

( Tý syel pechenye?

– "Was it you who ate the cookie?") – Ты съе́л печенье?

( Ty syél pechenye?

– "Did you eat the cookie?) – Ты съел пече́нье?

( Ty syel pechénye?

"Was it the cookie you ate?"). Stress marks are mandatory in lexical dictionaries and books for children or Russian learners.

[ 116 ] Phonology Main article: Russian phonology The Russian syllable structure can be quite complex, with both initial and final consonant clusters of up to four consecutive sounds. Using a formula with V standing for the nucleus (vowel) and C for each consonant, the maximal structure can be described as follows: (C)(C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C) Consonants Consonant phonemes Labial Alveolar / Dental Post- alveolar Palatal Velar plain pal.

plain pal.

plain pal.

plain pal.

Nasal m mʲ n nʲ Stop voiceless p pʲ t tʲ k kʲ voiced b bʲ d dʲ ɡ ɡʲ Affricate t͡s ( t͡sʲ ) t͡ɕ Fricative voiceless f fʲ s sʲ ʂ ɕ ː x xʲ voiced v vʲ z zʲ ʐ ( ʑ ː) ( ɣ ) ( ɣʲ ) Approximant ɫ lʲ j Trill r rʲ Russian is notable for its distinction based on palatalization of most of its consonants. The phoneme / ts / is generally considered to be always hard; however, loan words such as Цюрих and some other neologisms contain / tsʲ / through the word-building processes (e.g., фрицёнок ["фриц" plus diminutive "ёнок"], шпицята ["шпиц" plus diminutive "ята"]). Palatalization means that the center of the tongue is raised during and after the articulation of the consonant. In the case of /tʲ/ and /dʲ/ , the tongue is raised enough to produce slight frication (affricate sounds; cf. Belarusian ць, дзь, or Polish ć, dź). The sounds /t, d, ts, s, z, n, rʲ/ are dental , that is, pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the teeth rather than against the alveolar ridge . According to some linguists, the "plain" consonants are velarized as in Irish , something which is most noticeable when it involves a labial before a hard vowel, such as мы, /mˠɨː/ , "we" , or бэ, /bˠɛ/ , "the letter Б".

Vowels Front Central Back Close i ( ɨ ) u Mid e o Open a Russian vowel chart by Trofimov & Jones (1923 :55) Russian has five or six vowels in stressed syllables, /i, u, e, o, a/ , and in some analyses /ɨ/ , but in most cases these vowels have merged to only two to four vowels when unstressed: /i, u, a/ (or /ɨ, u, a/ ) after hard consonants and /i, u/ after soft ones. These vowels have several allophones , which are displayed on the diagram to the right.

[ 117 ] [ 118 ] Grammar Main article: Russian grammar Russian has preserved an Indo-European synthetic - inflectional structure, although considerable leveling has occurred. Russian grammar encompasses: a highly fusional morphology a syntax that, for the literary language, is the conscious fusion of three elements: [ 119 ] a polished vernacular foundation; [ clarification needed ] a Church Slavonic inheritance; a Western European style.

[ clarification needed ] The spoken language has been influenced by the literary one but continues to preserve characteristic forms. The dialects show various non-standard grammatical features.

[ 119 ] In terms of actual grammar, there are three tenses in Russian –  past, present, and future –  and each verb has two aspects (perfective and imperfective). Russian nouns each have a gender –  either feminine, masculine, or neuter, chiefly indicated by spelling at the end of the word. Words change depending on both their gender and function in the sentence. Russian has six cases : Nominative (for the grammatical subject), Accusative (for direct objects), Dative (for indirect objects), Genitive (to indicate possession or relation), Instrumental (to indicate 'with' or 'by means of'), and Prepositional (used after the locative prepositions в "in", на "on", о "about", при "in the presence of"). Verbs of motion in Russian –  such as 'go', 'walk', 'run', 'swim', and 'fly' –  use the imperfective or perfective form to indicate a single or return trip, and also use a multitude of prefixes to add shades of meaning to the verb. Such verbs also take on different forms to distinguish between concrete and abstract motion.

Russian Wiktionary 11 October 2021 442,533 Number of entries in the category Русский язык (Russian language) History and literary language Main article: History of the Russian language See also: Reforms of Russian orthography and Russian literature No single periodization is universally accepted. The history of the Russian language is sometimes divided into Old Russian from the 11th to 17th centuries, followed by Modern Russian .

[ 123 ] It is also sometimes divided into the following periods: [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 123 ] [ 48 ] Old Russian (with the earliest form sometimes referred to as Old East Slavic ; until the 13th–14th centuries); Middle Russian (13th–14th centuries until the 17th–18th centuries); Modern Russian (17th–18th centuries to the present).

The Ostromir Gospels of 1056 is the second oldest East Slavic book known, one of many medieval illuminated manuscripts preserved in the Russian National Library .

The emergence of writing (and thus Old Russian literature ) is dated to around the year 1000, after Old Church Slavonic was introduced as the liturgical language in the late 10th century.

[ 35 ] At this point, the two languages were mutually intelligible, but there were clear East Slavic and South Slavic forms.

[ 35 ] The vernacular was considered the "low variety" while Church Slavonic was considered the "high variety".

[ 126 ] The language found in the birch bark manuscripts of the 11th–15th centuries represents the closest approximation to the vernacular Old Russian language.

[ 127 ] [ 128 ] During the rise of Moscow as the political center of Russia in the 14th–16th centuries, in which the language is sometimes called Great Russian to distinguish it from the territories where the future Belarusian and Ukrainian languages developed, the attraction of speakers of the southern dialects gave rise to a hybrid dialect and this became the basis of the standard language.

[ 129 ] The main phonological development during this period was akanye .

[ 130 ] The political reforms of Peter the Great were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and modernization, but caused a need for a written language that more closely resembled the spoken vernacular.

[ 126 ] The polymath Mikhail Lomonosov , in his Russian Grammar (1755), defined three styles: the "high style" (i.e. Church Slavonic, which would be used for high poetic genres, in addition to religious texts), the "middle style" (for lyric poetry, literary prose, scientific works), and a "low style" (i.e. a pure vernacular, which would be used for personal correspondence and low comedy).

[ 126 ] The modern standard language is closest to the middle style.

[ 126 ] Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of Western Europe. By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke French daily, and German sometimes. Many Russian novels of the 19th century, e.g.

Leo Tolstoy 's War and Peace , contain entire paragraphs and even pages in French with no translation given, with an assumption that educated readers would not need one.

[ 131 ] The modern literary language was established by the time of Alexander Pushkin in the first third of the 19th century.

[ 126 ] Pushkin revolutionized Russian literature by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (the "high style") in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning. In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19th century, in particular Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov , Nikolai Gogol , Aleksander Griboyedov , became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech.

During the Soviet period, the policy toward the languages of the various other ethnic groups fluctuated in practice. Though each of the constituent republics had its own official language, the unifying role and superior status was reserved for Russian, although it was declared the official language only in 1990.

[ 132 ] Following the break-up of the USSR in 1991, several of the newly independent states have encouraged their native languages, which has partly reversed the privileged status of Russian, though its role as the language of post-Soviet national discourse throughout the region has continued.

[ 133 ] The Russian language in the world declined after 1991 due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and decrease in the number of Russians in the world and diminution of the total population in Russia (where Russian is an official language), however this [ clarification needed ] has since been reversed.

L., [ 136 ] the Russian language is gradually losing its position in the world in general, and in Russia in particular.

[ 134 ] [ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 23 ] In 2012, A. L. Arefyev published a new study "Russian language at the turn of the 20th–21st centuries", in which he confirmed his conclusion about the trend of weakening of the Russian language after the Soviet Union's collapse in various regions of the world (findings published in 2013 in the journal " Demoskop Weekly ").

[ 52 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] In the countries of the former Soviet Union the Russian language was being replaced or used in conjunction with local languages.
