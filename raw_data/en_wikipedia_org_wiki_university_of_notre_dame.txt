[ 9 ] Founded in 1842 by members of the Congregation of Holy Cross , a Catholic religious order of priests and brothers, the main campus of 1,261 acres (510 ha ) has a suburban setting and contains landmarks such as the Golden Dome main building, Sacred Heart Basilica , the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes , the Word of Life mosaic mural, and Notre Dame Stadium .

Notre Dame is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] The university is organized into seven schools and colleges: College of Arts and Letters , College of Science , Notre Dame Law School , School of Architecture , College of Engineering , Mendoza College of Business , and Keough School of Global Affairs. Notre Dame's graduate program includes more than 50 master, doctoral and professional degrees offered by the seven schools.

[ 12 ] The university's athletic teams are members of the NCAA Division I and are known collectively as the Fighting Irish . Notre Dame is noted for its football team , which contributed to its rise to prominence on the national stage in the early 20th century.

[ 13 ] Notre Dame teams in other sports, chiefly in the Atlantic Coast Conference , have won 17 national championships.

[ 14 ] Major improvements to the university occurred during Theodore Hesburgh 's administration between 1952 and 1987. Hesburgh's administration increased the university's resources, academic programs, and its reputation. At the end of the fiscal year 2022, Notre Dame's endowment was valued at $20.3 billion.

[ 15 ] Its network of alumni consists of 151,000 members.

[ 16 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of the University of Notre Dame Foundations [ edit ] Stephen Badin , the first priest ordained in the United States, had come to the area invited by Potawatomi chief Leopold Pokagon to minister to his tribe, and had bought these 524 acres (212 ha) of land in 1830. In 1842, the bishop of Vincennes , Célestin Guynemer de la Hailandière , offered the land to Edward Sorin of the Congregation of Holy Cross , on the condition that he build a college in two years.

[ 17 ] Sorin arrived on the site with eight Holy Cross brothers from France and Ireland on November 26, 1842, and began the school using Badin's old log chapel . After enrolling two students, Sorin soon erected more buildings, including the Old College , the first church, and the first main building.

[ 18 ] Notre Dame began as a primary and secondary school; in 1844 it received its official college charter from the Indiana General Assembly , [ 19 ] under the name of the University of Notre Dame du Lac (University of Our Lady of the Lake).

[ a ] The university was originally all-male; the Sisters of the Holy Cross founded the female-only Saint Mary's College near Notre Dame in 1844.

[ 21 ] Edward Sorin , founder of the university, photographed in 1890 Early history [ edit ] The college awarded its first degrees in 1849.

[ 22 ] As it grew under the presidency of Sorin and his successors, new academic programs were offered and new buildings built to accommodate the growing student and faculty population.

[ 23 ] [ 19 ] The brief presidency of Patrick Dillon (1865–1866) saw the original main building replaced with a larger one, which housed the university's administration, classrooms, and dormitories. Under William Corby 's first administration, enrollment at Notre Dame increased to over 500 students. In 1869, he opened the law school , which offered a two-year course of study, and in 1871 he began construction of Sacred Heart Church, today the Basilica of the Sacred Heart . Two years later, the president Auguste Lemonnier started a library in the Main Building, which had 10,000 volumes by 1879.

[ 24 ] The current Main Building , built after the great fire of 1879 However, fire destroyed the Main Building and the library collection in April 1879; the school closed immediately and students were sent home.

[ 25 ] Rebuilding began on May 17, and the third and current Main Building was completed before the fall semester of 1879. The library collection was likewise redeveloped.

[ 26 ] The presidency of Thomas E. Walsh (1881–1893) focused on improving Notre Dame's scholastic reputation and standards. At the time, many students came to Notre Dame only for its business courses and did not graduate.

[ 27 ] Walsh started a " Belles Lettres " program and invited notable lay intellectuals like writer Maurice Francis Egan to campus.

[ 28 ] Washington Hall was built in 1881 as a theater, [ 29 ] and the Science Hall (today the LaFortune Student Center ) was built in 1883 to house the science program (established in 1880) and multiple classrooms and science labs.

[ 30 ] The construction of Sorin Hall saw the first freestanding residence hall on campus and one of the first in the country to have private rooms for students, a project championed by Sorin and John Zahm.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] During Walsh's tenure, Notre Dame started its football program and awarded its first Laetare Medal , one the earlist such honors bequesthed by a Catholic university in the United States.

[ 33 ] The Law School was reorganized under the leadership of William J. Hoynes (dean from 1883 to 1919), and when its new building was opened shortly after his death, it was renamed in his honor.

[ 34 ] Growth [ edit ] John Zahm was the Holy Cross Provincial for the United States from 1898 to 1906, with overall supervision of the university. He sought to modernize and expand Notre Dame by erecting buildings and adding to the campus art gallery and library, amassing what became a famous Dante collection, and pushing Notre Dame toward becoming a research university dedicated to scholarship. The congregation did not renew Zahm's term, fearing he had expanded Notre Dame too quickly and had run the order into serious debt.

[ 34 ] In particular, his vision to make Notre Dame a research university was at odds with that of Andrew Morrissey (president from 1893 to 1905), who hoped to keep the institution a smaller boarding school.

[ 35 ] Morrissey's presidency remained largely focused on younger students and saw the construction of the Grotto , the addition of wings to Sorin Hall , and the erection of the first gymnasium. By 1900, student enrollment had increased to over 700, with most students still following the Commercial Course.

[ 36 ] The Basilica of the Sacred Heart , completed in 1888 The movement toward a research university was championed subsequently by John W. Cavanaugh , who modernized educational standards and dedicated himself to the school's academic reputation and to increasing the number of students awarded bachelor's and master's degrees. As part of his efforts, he attracted many eminent scholars, established a chair in journalism, and introduced courses in chemical engineering . During his time as president, Notre Dame rapidly became a significant force on the football field.

[ 37 ] In 1917, Notre Dame awarded its first degree to a woman, and its first bachelor's degree in 1922. However, female undergraduates were uncommon until 1972.

[ 38 ] James A. Burns became president in 1919 and, following in the footsteps of Cavanaugh, he oversaw an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving away from the traditional scholastic and classical emphasis in three years.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] Notre Dame continued to grow, adding more colleges, programs, residence halls, and sports teams.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce , [ 41 ] Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a law school.

[ 43 ] The University of Notre Dame in 1903 President Matthew Walsh (1922–1928) addressed the material needs of the university, particularly the $10,000 debt and the lack of space for new students. When he assumed the presidency, more than 1,100 students lived off campus while only 135 students paid for room and board. With fund-raising money, Walsh concentrated on the construction of a dormitory system. He built Freshman Hall in 1922 and Sophomore Hall in 1923, and began construction of Morrissey , Howard and Lyons Halls between 1924 and 1925.

[ 44 ] By 1925, enrollment had increased to 2,500 students, of which 1,471 lived on campus; faculty members increased from 90 to 175. On the academic side, credit hours were reduced to encourage in-depth study, and Latin and Greek were no longer required. In 1928, three years of college were made a prerequisite for the study of law.

[ 45 ] Walsh expanded the College of Commerce, enlarged the stadium, completed South Dining Hall, and built the memorial and entrance transept of the Basilica .

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] One of the main driving forces in the university's growth was its football team, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish.

[ 48 ] Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918. Under him, the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl Game in 1925, and produced players such as George Gipp and the " Four Horsemen ". Knute Rockne has the highest winning percentage (.881) in NCAA Division I/FBS football history. Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7–2–2 scheme .

[ 49 ] The success of Notre Dame reflected the rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied around the team and listened to the games on the radio, especially when it defeated teams from schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America—Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army.

[ 48 ] Its role as a high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism . The most remarkable episode of violence was a clash in 1924 between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), a white supremacist and anti-Catholic movement. The Klan decided to hold a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on May 17, when students blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped KKK clothes and regalia. Two days later, thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to refrain from further violence. A few days later, the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students contributed to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] Expansion in the 1930s and 1940s [ edit ] South Quad, built in the 1920s–1940s, includes many residential halls Charles L. O'Donnell (1928–1934) and John Francis O'Hara (1934–1939) fueled both material and academic expansion. During their tenures at Notre Dame, they brought many refugees and intellectuals to campus, such as W. B. Yeats , Frank H. Spearman , Jeremiah D. M. Ford , Irvin Abell , and Josephine Brownson for the Laetare Medal, instituted in 1883. O'Hara also concentrated on expanding the graduate school.

[ 52 ] New construction included Notre Dame Stadium , the law school building, Rockne Memorial, numerous residential halls, Cushing Hall of Engineering, and a new heating plant. This rapid expansion, which cost the university more than $2.8 million, was made possible in large part through football revenues. O'Hara strongly believed that the Fighting Irish football team could be an effective means to "acquaint the public with the ideals that dominate" Notre Dame. He wrote, "Notre Dame football is a spiritual service because it is played for the honor and glory of God and of his Blessed Mother. When St. Paul said: 'Whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all for the glory of God,' he included football." [ 53 ] During World War II , O'Donnell offered Notre Dame's facilities to the armed forces. The Navy accepted his offer and installed Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) units on campus as part of the V-12 Navy College Training Program .

[ 54 ] Soon after the installation, there were only a few hundred civilian students at Notre Dame. O'Donnell continued O'Hara's work with the graduate school. He formalized the graduate program further and replaced the previous committee of graduate studies with a dean.

[ 55 ] John J. Cavanaugh , president from 1946 to 1952, devoted his efforts to raising academic standards and reshaping the university administration to better serve its educational mission and an expanded student body. He stressed advanced studies and research while quadrupling the university's student population, with undergraduate enrollment seeing an increase by more than half, and graduate student enrollment growing fivefold. Cavanaugh established the Lobund Institute for Animal Studies and Notre Dame's Medieval Institute , [ 56 ] presided over the construction of  Nieuwland Science Hall, Fisher Hall, and the Morris Inn, and the Hall of Liberal Arts (now O'Shaughnessy Hall), made possible by a donation from I. A. O'Shaughnessy, at the time the largest ever made to an American Catholic university.

[ 57 ] He also established the university's system of advisory councils.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] Hesburgh era: 1952–1987 [ edit ] The Hesburgh Library , decorated by the Word of Life mural.

Theodore Hesburgh served as president for 35 years (1952–1987). Under his presidency, Notre Dame underwent huge growth and transformation from a school mostly known for its football to a top-tier university, academic powerhouse, and preeminent Catholic university.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] The annual operating budget rose by a factor of 18, from $9.7 million to $176.6 million; the endowment by a factor of 40, from $9 million to $350 million; and research funding by a factor of 20, from $735,000 to $15 million. Enrollment nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600; faculty more than doubled from 389 to 950, and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] Hesburgh made Notre Dame coeducational. Women had graduated every year since 1917, but they were mostly religious sisters in graduate programs.

[ 66 ] In the mid-1960s, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College developed a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered at their home institution. After extensive debate, merging with St. Mary's was rejected, primarily because of the differential in faculty qualifications and pay scales. "In American college education," explained Charles E. Sheedy , Notre Dame's dean of Arts and Letters, "certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable are now seen as anachronistic and out of place. ... In this environment of diversity, the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect, replacing separatism." [ 67 ] Two of the residence halls were converted for the newly admitted female students that first year, [ 68 ] [ 69 ] with two more converted the next school year.

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] In 1971, Mary Ann Proctor, a transfer from St. Mary's, became the first female undergraduate. The following year, Mary Davey Bliley became the first woman to graduate from the university, with a bachelor's degree in marketing.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] In 1978, a historic district comprising 21 contributing buildings was listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

[ 74 ] Recent history [ edit ] In the eighteen years Edward Malloy was president, the school's reputation, faculty, and resources grew rapidly.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] He added more than 500 professors and the academic quality of the student body improved dramatically, with the average Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) score rising from 1240 to 1460. The number of minority students more than doubled, the endowment grew from $350 million to more than $3 billion, the annual operating budget rose from $177 million to more than $650 million, and annual research funding improved from $15 million to more than $70 million.

[ 75 ] Notre Dame's most recent (2014) capital campaign raised $2.014 billion, far exceeding its goal of $767 million. It was the largest in the history of Catholic higher education, and the largest of any university without a medical school at the time.

[ 78 ] John I. Jenkins took over from Malloy in 2005.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] In his inaugural address, Jenkins described his goals of making the university a leader in research that recognizes ethics and builds the connection between faith and studies. During his tenure, Notre Dame has increased its endowment, enlarged its student body, and undergone many construction projects on campus, including the Compton Family Ice Arena , a new architecture hall, and additional residence halls.

[ 81 ] Announced as an integration of "the academy, student life and athletics," [ 82 ] construction on the 750,000 sq ft (70,000 m 2 ) Campus Crossroads project began around Notre Dame Stadium in November 2014. Its three buildings house student life services, an indoor gym, a recreation center, the career center, a 500-seat student ballroom, the departments of anthropology and psychology, a digital media center and the department of music and sacred music program.

[ 83 ] Jenkins announced the 2023–2024 academic year would be his last as president in October 2023. The board of trustees subsequently elected Robert A. Dowd to succeed him, effective June 1, 2024.

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] Campus [ edit ] Main article: Campus of the University of Notre Dame A view of the historical part of the campus, with the Basilica and Main Building Notre Dame's campus is located in Notre Dame, Indiana , in the Michiana area of Northern Indiana .

[ 86 ] It lies on 1,250 acres (510 ha), south of the Indiana Toll Road and includes around 170 buildings and athletic fields located around its two lakes and seven quadrangles .

[ 87 ] United States historic place University of Notre Dame: Main and South Quadrangles U.S. National Register of Historic Places U.S. Historic district The University's historic center, comprising the Basilica , the Golden Dome , and Washington Hall , was built in the early years of the university.

Location Off I-80/90, Notre Dame, Indiana Area 70 acres (28 ha) Built 1842 Architectural style Mixed (more than two styles from different periods) NRHP reference No.

78000053 [ 88 ] Added to NRHP May 23, 1978 It is consistently ranked as one of the most beautiful university campuses in the United States and around the world, and it is noted particularly for the Golden Dome, the Basilica and its stained glass windows, the quads and the greenery, the Grotto, the Hesburgh Library with its Word of Life stone mural (nicknamed "Touchdown Jesus" by students), and its statues and museums.

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Notre Dame is a major tourist attraction in northern Indiana; in the 2015–2016 academic year, more than 1.8 million visitors, almost half of whom were from outside St. Joseph County , visited the campus.

[ 94 ] A 116-acre (47 ha) historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 as University of Notre Dame: Main and South Quadrangles. The district includes 21 contributing buildings in the core of the original campus such  as the Main Administration Building and the Basilica.

[ 74 ] Administration and academic buildings [ edit ] The Main Building serves as the center for the university's administrative offices, including the Office of the President. Its golden dome, topped by the statue of Mary, is the campus' most recognizable landmark. The main building is located on Main Quad (also known as "God Quad"), which is the oldest, most historic, and most central part of campus. Behind the main building stands several facilities with administrative purposes and student services, including Carole Sadner Hall, Brownson Hall, and St. Liam's Hall, the campus health center.

There are several religious buildings.

[ 95 ] The current Basilica of the Sacred Heart is on the site of Sorin's original church, which had become too small for the growing college. It is built in French Revival style, with stained glass windows imported from France.

Luigi Gregori , an Italian painter invited by Sorin to be an artist in residence, painted the interior. The basilica also features a bell tower with a carillon. Inside the church, there are sculptures by Ivan Meštrović . The Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, built in 1896, is a replica of the original in Lourdes and is a popular spot for prayer and meditation.

[ 96 ] The Old College building has become one of two seminaries on the campus run by the Congregation of Holy Cross.

The Golden Dome, built under Sorin, has become the symbol of the university Academic buildings are concentrated in the Center-South and Center-East sections of campus. McCourtney Hall, an interdisciplinary research facility, opened its doors for the fall 2016 semester, and ground was broken on the 60,000 sq ft (5,600 m 2 ) Walsh Family Hall of Architecture on the south end of campus near the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center which opened in fall 2018.

[ 97 ] Since 2004, several buildings have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, [ 98 ] the Guglielmino Complex, [ 99 ] and the Jordan Hall of Science.

[ 100 ] A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall, a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building, Geddes Hall, and a law school addition were completed at the same time.

[ 101 ] Many academic buildings were built with a system of libraries, the most prominent of which is the Hesburgh Library, built in 1963 and today containing almost four million books. The Stayer Center for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department, opened in March 2013, just south of the Mendoza College of Business building.

Residential and student buildings [ edit ] Main article: University of Notre Dame residence halls There are 33 single-sex undergraduate residence halls . The university has recently announced a co-educational undergraduate dorm community based in one of the graduate residential apartments.

[ 102 ] Most of the graduate students on campus live in one of four graduate housing complexes on campus. A new residence for men, Baumer Hall , was built in 2019.

Johnson Family Hall , for women, was also completed and opened that semester. The South Dining Hall and North Dining Hall serve the student body.

Fall on the Main Quadrangle The campus hosts several entertainment, general purpose, and common spaces. LaFortune Student Center, commonly known as "LaFortune" or "LaFun," is a four-story building built in 1883 that serves the student union and hosts social, recreational, cultural, and educational activities.

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] LaFortune hosts many businesses (including restaurant chains), student services, and divisions of The Office of Student Affairs.

[ 103 ] [ 105 ] A second student union came with the addition of Duncan Student Center, which is built onto the Notre Dame Stadium as part of the Campus Crossroads projects. As well as additional food service chains, recreation facilities, and student offices, Duncan also hosts a student gym and a ballroom.

Historic Washington Hall on the Main Quadrangle, popularly termed the "God Quad" [ 106 ] Athletics facilities [ edit ] Because of its long athletic tradition, the university features many athletic buildings, which are concentrated in the southern and eastern sections of campus. The most prominent is Notre Dame Stadium, [ 107 ] home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several times and today can seat over 80,000 people. Prominent venues include the Edmund P. Joyce Center , with indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, [ 108 ] a two-rink facility dedicated to hockey. There are many outdoor fields, such as the Frank Eck Stadium for baseball.

[ 109 ] Legends of Notre Dame (commonly called Legends) is a music venue , public house , and restaurant on campus, just 100 yd (91 m) south of the stadium. The former Alumni Senior Club [ 110 ] opened in September 2003 after a $3.5 million renovation and became an all-ages student hang-out. Legends is made up of two parts: The Restaurant and Alehouse and the nightclub.

[ 111 ] The new wing of the Law School Environmental sustainability [ edit ] The Office of Sustainability was created in the fall of 2007 at the recommendation of a Sustainability Strategy Working Group and appointed the first director in April 2008. The pursuit of sustainability is related directly to the Catholic mission of the university.

[ 112 ] Other resources and centers on campus focusing on sustainability include the Environmental Change Initiative, Environmental Research Center, and the Center for Sustainable Energy at Notre Dame.

[ 113 ] The university also houses the Kellogg Institute for International Peace Studies.

Notre Dame received a gold rating from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) in 2014, though in 2017 it was downgraded to silver.

[ 114 ] In 2016, the Office of Sustainability released its Comprehensive Sustainability Strategy to achieve its goals in a wide area of university operations.

[ 115 ] As of November 2020 [update] , 17 buildings have achieved LEED-Certified status , with 12 of them earning Gold certification.

[ 116 ] Notre Dame's dining service sources 40 percent of its food locally and offers sustainably caught seafood and many organic, fair-trade, and vegan options.

[ 117 ] In 2019, irrigation systems' improvements led to 244 million fewer gallons of water being used and a 50 percent reduction in water consumption over 10 years.

[ 118 ] In 2015, Notre Dame announced major environmental sustainability goals, including eliminating using coal by 2020 and reducing its carbon footprint by half by 2030.

[ 113 ] Both these goals were reached in early 2019.

[ 119 ] [ 120 ] This was achieved by implementing energy conservation, energy efficiency strategies, temperature setpoints, low-flow water devices, and diversifying its energy sources and infrastructures.

[ 119 ] New sources of renewable energy on campus include geothermal wells on East Quad and by the Notre Dame Stadium, substitution of boilers with gas turbines, solar panels on Fitzpatrick Hall and Stinson-Remick Hall and off-campus, a hydroelectric facility at Seitz Park in South Bend powered by the St. Joseph River , and heat recovery strategies.

[ 121 ] [ 120 ] [ 113 ] Future projects outlined by the university's utilities long-range plan include continual diversification of its energy portfolio, future geothermal wells in new buildings and some existing facilities, and a collaboration with the South Bend Solar Project. Current goals include cutting Notre Dame's carbon footprint by 83 percent by 2050 and eventually becoming carbon neutral, diverting 67 percent of all waste from landfills by 2030.

[ 113 ] [ 120 ] [ 119 ] Global Gateways [ edit ] The former United University Club The university owns several centers around the world used for international studies and research, conferences abroad, and alumni support.

[ 122 ] London . The university has had a presence in London since 1968. Since 1998, its London center has been based in Fischer Hall, the former United University Club in Trafalgar Square. The center hosts the university's programs in the city, and conferences and symposia.

[ 123 ] The university also owns a residence facility, Conway Hall , for students studying abroad.

[ 124 ] Beijing . The university owns space in the Liangmaqiao Station area. The center is the hub of Notre Dame Asia. It hosts a number of programs including study abroad.

[ 305 ] Athletics [ edit ] Main article: Notre Dame Fighting Irish Notre Dame Stadium Notre Dame's sports teams are known as the Fighting Irish. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I , primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for all sports—except football and hockey —since the 2013–14 school year. Men's ice hockey is played in the Big Ten conference .

The football team competes as a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Independent [ 307 ] since its inception in 1887, except for 2020, when it competed as part of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Both fencing teams compete in the Midwest Fencing Conference .

[ 308 ] Football stadium during a game Notre Dame's sports conference affiliations, except football and fencing, changed in July 2013 because of major conference realignment , and its fencing affiliation changed in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; [ 309 ] [ 310 ] while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to playing five games per season against ACC opponents.

[ 311 ] After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year.

[ 312 ] There are many theories behind the adoption of the team name [ 313 ] but the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team, and alumnus Francis Wallace popularized it in his New York Daily News columns.

[ 314 ] Notre Dame's official colors are gold and navy blue.

[ 315 ] Green is sometimes worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.

[ 315 ] The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later the football program covers.

[ 326 ] Notre Dame has accumulated many rivals ; the annual game against USC for the Jeweled Shillelagh has been described as one of the greatest in college football.

[ 327 ] Coach Knute Rockne George Gipp was the school's legendary football player of the late 1910s.

[ 328 ] In 1928, coach Knute Rockne used his final conversation with the dying Gipp to inspire the Notre Dame team to beat Army and "win one for the Gipper"; that scene became the climax of the 1940 film Knute Rockne, All American , starring Pat O'Brien as Rockne and Ronald Reagan as Gipp.

[ 329 ] The team competes in the 80,795-seat Notre Dame Stadium.

[ 330 ] The current head coach is Marcus Freeman , who was promoted to head coach after Brian Kelly departed Notre Dame to coach at LSU at the end of the 2021 regular season .

Traditional activities begin at midnight with the Drummers' Circle, involving the Band of the Fighting Irish 's drumline beginning the other festivities that will continue the rest of the game day. Later that day, the trumpet section will play the Notre Dame Victory March and the Notre Dame Alma Mater under the dome. The entire band will play a concert at the steps of Bond Hall, then march into the stadium, leading fans and students alike across campus to the game.

[ 332 ] At the end of each game, the Notre Dame Marching Band plays the alma mater.

Nor is sport a purely Protestant concern: Catholicism can equally well be said to promote muscular Christianity, at least to some extent, through the athletic programs of such leading schools as the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.

As neo-orthodoxy arose in the mainline Protestant churches, Muscular Christianity declined there. It did not, however, disappear from American landscape, because it found some new sponsors. In the early 2000s (decade) these include the Catholic Church and various rightward-leaning Protestant groups. The Catholic Church promotes Muscular Christianity in the athletic programs of schools such as Notre Dame, as do evangelical Protestant groups such as Promise Keepers , Athletes in Action , and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes .
