These stars are hot, with surface temperatures between 75,000 K and 200,000 K, [ 2 ] and are characterized by atmospheres with little hydrogen and absorption lines for helium , carbon and oxygen .  Their surface gravity is typically between 10 4 and 10 6 meters per second squared .  Some PG 1159 stars are still fusing helium.

[ 3 ] , § 2.1.1, 2.1.2, Table 2.

The PG 1159 stars are named after their prototype, PG 1159-035 .  This star, found in the Palomar-Green survey of ultraviolet -excess stellar objects , [ 4 ] was the first PG 1159 star discovered.

It is thought that the atmospheric composition of PG 1159 stars is odd because, after they have left the asymptotic giant branch , they have reignited helium fusion .  As a result, a PG 1159 star's atmosphere is a mixture of material which was between the hydrogen- and helium-burning shells of its AGB star progenitor.

[ 3 ] , §1.

They are believed to eventually lose mass, cool, and become DO white dwarfs.

[ 2 ] ; [ 5 ] , §4.

Some PG 1159 stars have varying luminosities .  These stars vary slightly (5–10%) in brightness due to non-radial gravity wave pulsations within themselves.  They vibrate in a number of modes simultaneously, with typical periods between 300 and 3,000 seconds .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] , Table 1.

The first known star of this type is also PG 1159-035, which was found to be variable in 1979, [ 8 ] and was given the variable star designation GW Virginis in 1985.

[ 9 ] These stars are called GW Vir stars , after their prototype, or the class may be split into DOV and PNNV stars.
