In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **rigid transformation** (also called **Euclidean transformation** or **Euclidean isometry**) is a [geometric transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation "Geometric transformation") of a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") that preserves the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance") between every pair of points.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_transformation#cite_note-Bottema-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_transformation#cite_note-McCarthy-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_transformation#cite_note-3)

The rigid transformations include [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)"), [translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)"), [reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)"), or any sequence of these. Reflections are sometimes excluded from the definition of a rigid transformation by requiring that the transformation also preserve the [handedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(mathematics) "Orientation (mathematics)") of objects in the Euclidean space. (A reflection would not preserve handedness; for instance, it would transform a left hand into a right hand.) To avoid ambiguity, a transformation that preserves handedness is known as a **rigid motion**, a **Euclidean motion**, or a **proper rigid transformation**.

In dimension two, a rigid motion is either a [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") or a [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)"). In dimension three, every rigid motion can be decomposed as the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") of a rotation and a translation, and is thus sometimes called a **rototranslation**. In dimension three, all rigid motions are also [screw motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_motion "Screw motion") (this is [Chasles' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasles%27_theorem_(kinematics) "Chasles' theorem (kinematics)")).

In dimension at most three, any improper rigid transformation can be decomposed into an [improper rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_rotation "Improper rotation") followed by a translation, or into a sequence of [reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)").

Any object will keep the same [shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape "Shape") and size after a proper rigid transformation.

All rigid transformations are examples of [affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformations "Affine transformations"). The set of all (proper and improper) rigid transformations is a [mathematical group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") called the _[Euclidean group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean\_group "Euclidean group")_, denoted E(_n_) for n-dimensional Euclidean spaces. The set of rigid motions is called the special Euclidean group, and denoted SE(_n_).

In [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics"), rigid motions in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space are used to represent displacements of [rigid bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body"). According to [Chasles' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasles%27_theorem_(kinematics) "Chasles' theorem (kinematics)"), every rigid transformation can be expressed as a [screw motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_motion "Screw motion").

A rigid transformation is formally defined as a transformation that, when acting on any vector **v**, produces a transformed vector _T_(**v**) of the form

_T_(**v**) = _R_**v** + **t**

where _R_ T = _R_−1 (i.e., R is an [orthogonal transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_transformation "Orthogonal transformation")), and **t** is a vector giving the translation of the origin.

A proper rigid transformation has, in addition,

which means that _R_ does not produce a reflection, and hence it represents a [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)") (an orientation-preserving orthogonal transformation). Indeed, when an orthogonal [transformation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix "Transformation matrix") produces a reflection, its determinant is −1.

A measure of distance between points, or [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space"), is needed in order to confirm that a transformation is rigid. The [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance") formula for **R**_n_ is the generalization of the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem"). The formula gives the distance squared between two points **X** and **Y** as the sum of the squares of the distances along the coordinate axes, that is ![Image 1: {\displaystyle d\left(\mathbf {X} ,\mathbf {Y} \right)^{2}=\left(X_{1}-Y_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(X_{2}-Y_{2}\right)^{2}+\dots +\left(X_{n}-Y_{n}\right)^{2}=\left(\mathbf {X} -\mathbf {Y} \right)\cdot \left(\mathbf {X} -\mathbf {Y} \right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4094a97aba1f42c5ed6efc519f42de753b5e467b) where **X** = (_X_ 1, _X_ 2, ..., _X_ _n_) and **Y** = (_Y_ 1, _Y_ 2, ..., _Y_ _n_), and the dot denotes the [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_product "Scalar product").

Using this distance formula, a rigid transformation _g_: **R**_n_ → **R**_n_ has the property, ![Image 2: {\displaystyle d(g(\mathbf {X} ),g(\mathbf {Y} ))^{2}=d(\mathbf {X} ,\mathbf {Y} )^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff3cdd2761ae246ea017493f33d822719f35d223)

Translations and linear transformations
---------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigid_transformation&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Translations and linear transformations")]

A [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") of a vector space adds a vector **d** to every vector in the space, which means it is the transformation

_g_(**v**) = **v** + **d**.

It is easy to show that this is a rigid transformation by showing that the distance between translated vectors equal the distance between the original vectors: ![Image 3: {\displaystyle d(\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {d} ,\mathbf {w} +\mathbf {d} )^{2}=(\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {d} -\mathbf {w} -\mathbf {d} )\cdot (\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {d} -\mathbf {w} -\mathbf {d} )=(\mathbf {v} -\mathbf {w} )\cdot (\mathbf {v} -\mathbf {w} )=d(\mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {w} )^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/30c712aad2546e9253551aa11a05ec7f8ba7927b)

A _linear transformation_ of a vector space, _L_: **R**_n_ → **R**_n_, preserves [linear combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination "Linear combination"), ![Image 4: {\displaystyle L(\mathbf {V} )=L(a\mathbf {v} +b\mathbf {w} )=aL(\mathbf {v} )+bL(\mathbf {w} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/98e256a928a8e46b76eac4b195064dd40a421254) A linear transformation _L_ can be represented by a matrix, which means

_L_: **v** → [_L_]**v**,

where [_L_] is an _n_×_n_ matrix.

A linear transformation is a rigid transformation if it satisfies the condition, ![Image 5: {\displaystyle d([L]\mathbf {v} ,[L]\mathbf {w} )^{2}=d(\mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {w} )^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b95d5d088ebfd3c1a83d9632aef170d7ce89c7ce) that is ![Image 6: {\displaystyle d([L]\mathbf {v} ,[L]\mathbf {w} )^{2}=([L]\mathbf {v} -[L]\mathbf {w} )\cdot ([L]\mathbf {v} -[L]\mathbf {w} )=([L](\mathbf {v} -\mathbf {w} ))\cdot ([L](\mathbf {v} -\mathbf {w} )).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a1561e0e6f1c153f1b8a660cc137813fb1efa8ff) Now use the fact that the scalar product of two vectors **v**.**w** can be written as the matrix operation **v**T**w**, where the T denotes the matrix transpose, we have ![Image 7: {\displaystyle d([L]\mathbf {v} ,[L]\mathbf {w} )^{2}=(\mathbf {v} -\mathbf {w} )^{\mathsf {T}}[L]^{\mathsf {T}}[L](\mathbf {v} -\mathbf {w} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/69df9a7512bc5ed4778c97c08617b2de944d1c75) Thus, the linear transformation _L_ is rigid if its matrix satisfies the condition ![Image 8: {\displaystyle [L]^{\mathsf {T}}[L]=[I],}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fcbfef3a9e5057b903d2a200f02f8f1c33677732) where [_I_] is the identity matrix. Matrices that satisfy this condition are called _orthogonal matrices._ This condition actually requires the columns of these matrices to be orthogonal unit vectors.

Matrices that satisfy this condition form a mathematical [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") under the operation of matrix multiplication called the _orthogonal group of n×n matrices_ and denoted _O_(_n_).

Compute the determinant of the condition for an [orthogonal matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix "Orthogonal matrix") to obtain ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \det \left([L]^{\mathsf {T}}[L]\right)=\det[L]^{2}=\det[I]=1,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0fb98c4e139d1342f866cef17d1ba228a841ac3b) which shows that the matrix [_L_] can have a determinant of either +1 or −1. Orthogonal matrices with determinant −1 are reflections, and those with determinant +1 are rotations. Notice that the set of orthogonal matrices can be viewed as consisting of two manifolds in **R**_n_×_n_ separated by the set of singular matrices.

The set of rotation matrices is called the _special orthogonal group,_ and denoted SO(_n_). It is an example of a [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") because it has the structure of a manifold.
