It constitutes a genre of Arabic literature . Associated with the medieval Islamic notion of "travel in search of  knowledge" (الرحلة في طلب العلم), the riḥla as a genre of medieval and early-modern Arabic literature usually describes a journey taken with the intent of performing the Hajj, but can include an itinerary that vastly exceeds that original route.

[ 1 ] The classical riḥla in medieval Arabic travel literature , like those written by Ibn Battuta (known commonly as The Rihla ) and Ibn Jubayr , includes a description of the "personalities, places, governments, customs, and curiosities" experienced by the traveler, and usually within the boundaries of the Muslim world.

[ 2 ] However, the term rihla can be applied to other Arabic travel narratives describing journeys taken for reasons other than pilgrimage; for instance, the 19th–century riḥla s of Muhammad as-Saffar [ 3 ] and Rifa'a al-Tahtawi [ 4 ] both follow conventions of the riḥla genre by recording not only the journey to France from Morocco and Egypt, respectively, but also their experiences and observations.

As travel [ edit ] The Rihla travel practice originated in Middle Ages Morocco and served to connect Muslims of Morocco to the collective consciousness of the ummah across the Islamic world, thereby generating a larger sense of community.

Rihla consists of three types: [ 5 ] Rihla — journey within Morocco, typically to meet with other pilgrims before traveling beyond the local area.

Rihla hijaziyya - journey to the Hejaz which would be transmitted via an oral or written report.

Rihla sifariyya — journey to foreign lands including to embassies and missions in territories in Dar al-Harb .  Events on these journeys would be the basis of the extant travel literature.

The performance of Rihla was considered in Moorish al-Andalus as a qualifier for teachers and political leaders.

[ 6 ] These journeys also coincided with the end of the Mongol invasions and a new opportunity for Islamic expansion.

[ 7 ] As literature [ edit ] The travel narratives of Ibn Jubayr and Ibn Battuta are perceived as "archetypical exponents of the flowering of [the riḥla ] genre," [ 1 ] but should not be perceived as its founders. Concerning Ibn Jubayr's voyage to Mecca in 1183, one writer claimed that "...his two-year journey made a considerable impact on literary history. His account of his travels and tribulations in the East served as the foundational work of a new genre of writing, the rihla, or the creative travelogue: a mix of personal narrative, description, opinion and anecdote. In following centuries, countless people emulated and even plagiarized him." [ 8 ] Travel narratives were written prior to Ibn Jubayr's; for example, the 12th–century riḥla of Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi , and accounts of foreign lands visited by merchants and diplomats (such as the 9th century accounts of India and China by Abu Zayd al-Sirafi , and the 10th–century riḥla by Ibn Fadlan with the Abbasid mission to the Volga) long predate Ibn Jubayr's travelogue.

[ 9 ] The best-known rihla narrative is Ibn Battuta 's Masterpiece to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling ( تحفة النظار في غرائب الأمصار وعجائب الأسفار , or Tuḥfat an-Nuẓẓār fī Gharāʾib al-Amṣār wa ʿAjāʾib al-Asfār ), often referred to as the Travels of Ibn Battuta ( رحلة ابن بطوطة , or Riḥlat Ibn Baṭūṭah ). The Travels was dictated to Ibn Juzayy on orders from the Marinid Sultan Abu Inan Faris , who was impressed by the story of Ibn Battuta.

[ 10 ] Although Ibn Battuta was an accomplished and well-documented explorer, his travels had been unknown outside the Islamic world for many years.

[ 11 ] The Rihla of Abdallah al-Tijani describes his 970-day round trip from Tunis to Tripoli between 1306 and 1309.
