N verify ( what is Y N ?) Infobox references Chemical compound Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate ( RuBP ) is an organic substance that is involved in photosynthesis , notably as the principal CO 2 acceptor in plants.

[ 1 ] : 2 It is a colourless anion, a double phosphate ester of the ketopentose ( ketone -containing sugar with five carbon atoms) called ribulose . Salts of RuBP can be isolated, but its crucial biological function happens in solution.

[ 2 ] RuBP occurs not only in plants but in all domains of life , including Archaea , Bacteria , and Eukarya .

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] RuBP was originally discovered by Andrew Benson in 1951 while working in the lab of Melvin Calvin at UC Berkeley.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Calvin, who had been away from the lab at the time of discovery and was not listed as a co-author, controversially removed the full molecule name from the title of the initial paper, identifying it solely as "ribulose".

[ 4 ] [ 6 ] At the time, the molecule was known as ribulose diphosphate (RDP or RuDP) but the prefix di- was changed to bis- to emphasize the nonadjacency of the two phosphate groups.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 7 ] Role in photosynthesis and the Calvin-Benson Cycle [ edit ] See also: Calvin-Benson Cycle The enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase ( rubisco ) catalyzes the reaction between RuBP and carbon dioxide . The product is the highly unstable six-carbon intermediate known as 3-keto-2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, or 2'-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (CKABP).

[ 8 ] This six-carbon β-ketoacid intermediate hydrates into another six-carbon intermediate in the form of a gem-diol .

[ 9 ] This intermediate then cleaves into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) which is used in a number of metabolic pathways and is converted into glucose.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] In the Calvin-Benson cycle , RuBP is a product of the phosphorylation of ribulose-5-phosphate (produced by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ) by ATP .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] The Calvin-Benson cycle showing the role of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate.

Interactions with rubisco [ edit ] RuBP acts as an enzyme inhibitor for the enzyme rubisco, which regulates the net activity of carbon fixation.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] When RuBP is bound to an active site of rubisco, the ability to activate via carbamylation with CO 2 and Mg 2+ is blocked. The functionality of rubisco activase involves removing RuBP and other inhibitory bonded molecules to re-enable carbamylation on the active site.

[ 1 ] : 5 Role in photorespiration [ edit ] See also: Photorespiration Rubisco also catalyzes RuBP with oxygen ( O 2 ) in an interaction called photorespiration , a process that is more prevalent at high temperatures.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] During photorespiration RuBP combines with O 2 to become 3-PGA and phosphoglycolic acid .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Like the Calvin-Benson Cycle, the photorespiratory pathway has been noted for its enzymatic inefficiency [ 19 ] [ 20 ] although this characterization of the enzymatic kinetics of rubisco has been contested.

[ 21 ] Due to enhanced RuBP carboxylation and decreased rubisco oxygenation stemming from the increased concentration of CO 2 in the bundle sheath , rates of photorespiration are decreased in C 4 plants .

[ 1 ] : 103 Similarly, photorespiration is limited in CAM photosynthesis due to kinetic delays in enzyme activation, again stemming from the ratio of carbon dioxide to oxygen.

[ 22 ] Measurement [ edit ] RuBP can be measured isotopically via the conversion of 14 CO 2 and RuBP into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate .

[ 23 ] G3P can then be measured using an enzymatic optical assay .

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ a ] Given the abundance of RuBP in biological samples, an added difficulty is distinguishing particular reservoirs of the substrate, such as the RuBP internal to a chloroplast vs external. One approach to resolving this is by subtractive inference, or measuring the total RuBP of a system, removing a reservoir (e.g. by centrifugation), re-measuring the total RuBP, and using the difference to infer the concentration in the given repository.
