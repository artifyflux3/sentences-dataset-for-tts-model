In November 1960, the board of directors of the nonprofit publisher [Annual Reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_Reviews_(publisher) "Annual Reviews (publisher)") began investigating the need for a new journal of [review articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_article "Review article") that covered developments in [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") and [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics"). The board consulted an advisory group of experts, including [Ronald Bracewell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Bracewell "Ronald Bracewell"), [Robert Jastrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jastrow "Robert Jastrow"), [Joseph Kaplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kaplan "Joseph Kaplan"), [Paul Merrill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Merrill "Paul Merrill"), [Otto Struve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Struve "Otto Struve"), and [Harold Urey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Urey "Harold Urey"). The editorial committee met in August 1961 to determine the authors and topics for the first volume, which was published in 1963.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_Review_of_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics#cite_note-5) As of 2020, it was published both in print and electronically.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_Review_of_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics#cite_note-6)

The _Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics_ defines its scope as covering significant developments in astronomy and astrophysics, including the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet "Exoplanet"), [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium"), the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") and other [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxies "Galaxies"), galactic nuclei, [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), and the instrumentation and techniques used for research and analysis.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_Review_of_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics#cite_note-ARAA-2) As of 2025, _[Journal Citation Reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal\_Citation\_Reports "Journal Citation Reports")_ gives the journal an [impact factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor "Impact factor") of 32.5, ranking it first out of 84 journals in the category "Astronomy and Astrophysics".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_Review_of_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics#cite_note-IF-1) It is [abstracted and indexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstracting_and_indexing "Abstracting and indexing") in [Scopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus "Scopus"), [Science Citation Index Expanded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Citation_Index_Expanded "Science Citation Index Expanded"), [Civil Engineering Abstracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Engineering_Abstracts "Civil Engineering Abstracts"), [Inspec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspec "Inspec"), and [Academic Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_Search "Academic Search"), among others.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_Review_of_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics#cite_note-7)

Editorial processes
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annual_Review_of_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Editorial processes")]

The _Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics_ is led by the editor or co-editors. They are is assisted by the editorial committee, which includes associate editors, regular members, and occasionally guest editors. Guest members participate at the invitation of the editor, and serve terms of one year. All other members of the editorial committee are appointed by the Annual Reviews board of directors and serve five-year terms. The editorial committee determines which topics should be included in each volume and solicits reviews from qualified authors.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_Review_of_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics#cite_note-8) Unsolicited manuscripts are not accepted. [Peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review "Peer review") of accepted manuscripts is undertaken by the editorial committee.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_Review_of_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics#cite_note-9)

Dates indicate publication years in which someone was credited as a lead editor or co-editor of a journal volume. The planning process for a volume begins well before the volume appears, so appointment to the position of lead editor generally occurred prior to the first year shown here. An editor who has retired or died may be credited as a lead editor of a volume that they helped to plan, even if it is published after their retirement or death.
