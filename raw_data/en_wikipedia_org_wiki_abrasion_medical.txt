[ 1 ] It can be superficial, which involves only the epidermis, or deep, which involves the deep dermis. Abrasions usually involve minimal bleeding.

[ 2 ] Mild abrasions, also known as grazes or scrapes , do not scar or bleed because the dermis is left intact, but deep abrasions that disrupt the normal dermal structures may lead to the formation of scar tissue. A more traumatic abrasion that removes all layers of skin is called an avulsion .

Abrasion injuries most commonly occur when exposed skin comes into moving contact with a rough surface, causing a grinding or rubbing away of the upper layers of the epidermis.

By degree [ edit ] Abrasions on elbow and lower arm. The elbow wound will produce a permanent scar .

A first-degree abrasion involves only epidermal injury.

A second-degree abrasion involves the epidermis as well as the dermis and may bleed slightly.

A third-degree abrasion involves damage to the subcutaneous layer and the skin and is often called an avulsion .

Treatment [ edit ] The abrasion should be cleaned and any debris removed. A topical antibiotic (such as neomycin or bacitracin ) should be applied to prevent infection and to keep the wound moist.

[ 3 ] Dressing the wound is beneficial because it helps keep the wound from drying out, providing a moist environment conducive for healing .

[ 4 ] If the abrasion is painful, a topical analgesic (such as lidocaine or benzocaine ) can be applied, but for large abrasions, a systemic analgesic may be necessary.

[ 3 ] Avoid exposing abraded skin to the sun as permanent hyperpigmentation can develop.

Healing [ edit ] The gallery below shows the healing process for an abrasion on the palm caused by sliding on concrete.
