For planned missions to the Moon see the dedicated list of missions to the Moon, with its section future missions . Launched probes are in the List of Solar System probes and the List of active Solar System probes .

The spacecraft were already assembled at the time of suspension/cancellation, so these missions can be resumed.

Mission name Cancellation date Description Status and reason Ref(s) Janus 2023 Dual asteroids probe Was expected to be a secondary payload on the Psyche launch. After the delay, it was assessed that Janus wouldn't be able to reach the required trajectory. Both spacecraft were placed into long-term storage.

[ 36 ] Kazachok 2022 Mars lander Originally part of the joint ExoMars mission with ESA, planned to deliver Rosalind Franklin rover. Mission was cancelled because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Spacecraft was returned to Roscosmos ; officials stated that they will launch it without the rover, but no date was given.
