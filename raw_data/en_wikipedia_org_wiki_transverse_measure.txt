Definition [ edit ] Let V be a real vector space together with a metric space structure with respect to which it is complete . A Borel measure μ is said to be transverse to a Borel-measurable subset S of V if there exists a compact subset K of V with 0 < μ ( K ) < +∞; and μ ( v + S ) = 0 for all v ∈ V , where v + S = { v + s ∈ ∈ V | s ∈ ∈ S } {\displaystyle v+S=\{v+s\in V|s\in S\}} is the translate of S by v .

The first requirement ensures that, for example, the trivial measure is not considered to be a transverse measure.

Example [ edit ] As an example, take V to be the Euclidean plane R 2 with its usual Euclidean norm/metric structure. Define a measure μ on R 2 by setting μ ( E ) to be the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure of the intersection of E with the first coordinate axis: μ μ ( E ) = λ λ 1 ( { x ∈ ∈ R | ( x , 0 ) ∈ ∈ E ⊆ ⊆ R 2 } ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (E)=\lambda ^{1}{\big (}\{x\in \mathbf {R} |(x,0)\in E\subseteq \mathbf {R} ^{2}\}{\big )}.} An example of a compact set K with positive and finite μ -measure is K = B 1 (0), the closed unit ball about the origin, which has μ ( K ) = 2. Now take the set S to be the second coordinate axis. Any translate ( v 1 , v 2 ) + S of S will meet the first coordinate axis in precisely one point, ( v 1 , 0). Since a single point has Lebesgue measure zero, μ (( v 1 , v 2 ) + S ) = 0, and so μ is transverse to S .
