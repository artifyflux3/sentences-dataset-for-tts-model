( June 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Neodymium-doped yttrium orthovanadate ( Nd:YVO 4 ) is a crystalline material formed by adding neodymium ions to yttrium orthovanadate . It is commonly used as an active laser medium for diode-pumped solid-state lasers . It comes as a transparent blue-tinted material. It is birefringent , therefore rods made of it are usually rectangular.

As in all neodymium-doped laser crystals, the lasing action of Nd:YVO 4 is due to its content of neodymium ions, which may be excited by visible or infrared light, and undergo an electronic transition resulting in emission of coherent infrared light at a lower frequency, usually at 1064 nm (other transitions in Nd are available, and can be selected for by external optics).
