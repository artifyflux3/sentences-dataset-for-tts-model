The term was coined and illuminated by Thomas Nagel in his famous paper " What Is It Like to Be a Bat?

" [ 1 ] Nagel argues that, because bats are apparently conscious mammals with a way of perceiving their environment entirely different from that of human beings , it is impossible to speak of "what is it like to be a bat for the bat" or, while the example of the bat is particularly illustrative, any conscious species, as each organism has a unique point of view from which no other organism can gather experience .

[ citation needed ] To Nagel, the subjective character of experience implies the cognitive closure of the human mind to some facts, specifically the mental states that physical states create.
