Along with pions and omega mesons , the rho meson carries the nuclear force within the atomic nucleus . After the octet consisting of the pions, kaons , and eta meson , the rho mesons are the lightest strongly interacting particle, with a mass of about 775 MeV for all three states.

[ c ] The rho mesons have a very short lifetime and their decay width is about 145 MeV ; because that is large compared with the mass, the resonance width measurably deviates from a Breit–Wigner form. The principal decay route of the rho mesons is to a pair of pions with a branching rate of 99.9% (however, all neutral pions is forbidden).

[ d ] History [ edit ] After several false starts, the ρ meson and the ω meson were discovered at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1961.

[ 2 ] Composition [ edit ] The rho mesons can be interpreted [ 3 ] as a bound state of a quark and an anti-quark and is an excited version of the pion. Unlike the pion, the rho meson has spin j = 1 (a vector meson ) and a much higher value of the mass. They attribute this mass difference between the pions and rho mesons to a large hyperfine interaction between the quark and anti-quark, although an objection with the De Rujula–Georgi–Glashow description is that it attributes the lightness of the pions as an accident rather than a result of chiral symmetry breaking .

The rho mesons can be thought of as the gauge bosons of a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry whose local character is emergent (arising from QCD ); Note that this broken gauge symmetry (sometimes called hidden local symmetry) is distinct from the global chiral symmetry acting on the flavors . This was described by Howard Georgi in a paper titled "The Vector Limit of Chiral Symmetry" where he ascribed much of the literature of hidden local symmetry to a non-linear sigma model .

^ There must be a small mass difference between the charged ρ + and the neutral ρ 0 that can be attributed to electromagnetic self-energy of the particle as well as the quark masses; however, the current experimental data are unable to show a significant difference.

^ Neutral rho mesons can decay to a pair of electrons or muons which occurs with a branching ratio of 5 × 10 −5 . This decay of the neutral rho to leptons can be interpreted as a mixing between the photon and rho. In principle the charged rho mesons mix with the weak vector bosons and can lead to decay to an electron or muon plus a neutrino ; however, this has never been observed.
