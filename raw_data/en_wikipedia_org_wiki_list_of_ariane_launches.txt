The recently retired Ariane 5 , flew 82 consecutive missions without failure between April 2003 and December 2017, but suffered a malfunction during flight VA-241 in January 2018, causing its two satellites to reach an incorrect orbit, and reducing their predicted lifetime as they consumed some of their own fuel to raise their orbits.
