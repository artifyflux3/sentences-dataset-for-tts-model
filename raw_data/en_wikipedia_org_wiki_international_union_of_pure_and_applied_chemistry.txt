It is a member of the International Science Council (ISC).

[ 2 ] IUPAC is registered in Zürich , Switzerland , and the administrative office, known as the "IUPAC Secretariat", is in Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , United States . IUPAC's executive director heads this administrative office, [ 3 ] currently Fabienne Meyers.

[ 4 ] IUPAC was established in 1919 as the successor of the International Congress of Applied Chemistry for the advancement of chemistry . Its members, the National Adhering Organizations, can be national chemistry societies , national academies of sciences , or other bodies representing chemists. There are fifty-four National Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering Organizations.

[ 2 ] IUPAC's Inter-divisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols ( IUPAC nomenclature ) is the recognized world authority in developing standards for naming the chemical elements and compounds . Since its creation, IUPAC has been run by many different committees with different responsibilities.

[ 5 ] These committees run different projects which include standardizing nomenclature , [ 6 ] finding ways to bring chemistry to the world, [ 7 ] and publishing works.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] IUPAC is best known for its works standardizing nomenclature in chemistry, but IUPAC has publications in many science fields including chemistry, biology, and physics.

[ 11 ] Some important work IUPAC has done in these fields includes standardizing nucleotide base sequence code names; publishing books for environmental scientists, chemists, and physicists; and improving education in science.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] IUPAC is also known for standardizing the atomic weights of the elements through one of its oldest standing committees, the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights (CIAAW).

Creation and history [ edit ] Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz The need for an international standard for chemistry was first addressed in 1860 by a committee headed by German scientist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz . This committee was the first international conference to create an international naming system for organic compounds .

[ 11 ] The ideas that were formulated at that conference evolved into the official IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry .

[ 11 ] IUPAC is a legacy of this meeting, making it one of the most important historical international collaborations of chemistry societies .

[ 11 ] IUPAC as such was established in 1919.

[ 13 ] Since this time, IUPAC has been the official organization  with the responsibility of updating and maintaining official organic nomenclature .

[ 14 ] One notable country excluded from  early IUPAC was  Germany. Germany's exclusion was a result of prejudice towards it by the Allied powers after World War I .

[ 15 ] Germany was finally admitted into IUPAC in 1929. However, Nazi Germany was removed from IUPAC during World War II . At this time, IUPAC was affiliated with the Allied powers , but had little involvement with the war effort itself.

East and West Germany were only readmitted to IUPAC in 1973.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Since World War II, IUPAC has  focused on standardizing nomenclature and methods in science.

In 2016, IUPAC denounced the use of chlorine as a chemical weapon . In a letter to Ahmet Üzümcü,  director of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),  the organization pointed out their concerns in regards to  chlorine weapon usage in the Syrian civil war and other places
. The letter stated, "Our organizations deplore the use of chlorine in this manner. The indiscriminate attacks, possibly carried out by a member state of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), are of concern to chemical scientists and engineers around the globe and we stand ready to support your mission of implementing the CWC." According to the CWC, "the use, stockpiling, distribution, development or storage of any chemical weapons is forbidden by any of the 192 state party signatories." [ 17 ] Committees and governance [ edit ] IUPAC is governed by several committees that all have different responsibilities. The committees are as follows: Bureau, CHEMRAWN (Chem Research Applied to World Needs) Committee, Committee on Chemistry Education, Committee on Chemistry and Industry, Committee on Printed and Electronic Publications, Evaluation Committee, Executive Committee, Finance Committee, Interdivisional Committee on Terminology, Nomenclature and Symbols, Project Committee, and Pure and Applied Chemistry Editorial Advisory Board.

[ 5 ] Each committee is made up of members of different National Adhering Organizations from different countries.

[ 2 ] The steering committee hierarchy for IUPAC is as follows: [ 18 ] All committees have an allotted budget to which they must adhere.

Any committee may start a project.

If a project's spending becomes too much for a committee to continue funding, it must take the issue to the Project Committee.

The project committee either increases the budget or decides on an external funding plan.

The Bureau and Executive Committee oversee operations of the other committees.

Hence, the naming rules were formulated by IUPAC.

[ 27 ] Basic spellings [ edit ] IUPAC establishes rules for harmonized spelling of some chemicals to reduce variation among different local English-language variants. For example, they recommend " aluminium " rather than "aluminum", " sulfur " rather than "sulphur", and " caesium " rather than "cesium".

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] Organic nomenclature [ edit ] Main article: IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry IUPAC organic nomenclature has three basic parts: the substituents , carbon chain length, and chemical affix.

[ 14 ] The substituents are any functional groups attached to the main carbon chain. The main carbon chain is the longest possible continuous chain. The chemical affix denotes what type of molecule it is. For example, the ending ane denotes a single bonded carbon chain, as in "hexane" ( C 6 H 14 ).

[ 30 ] Another example of IUPAC organic nomenclature is cyclohexanol : Cyclohexanol The substituent name for a ring compound is cyclo .

The indication (substituent name) for a six carbon chain is hex .

The chemical ending for a single bonded carbon chain is ane .

The chemical ending for an alcohol is ol .

The two chemical endings are combined for an ending of anol indicating a single bonded carbon chain with an alcohol attached to it.

[ 14 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Inorganic nomenclature [ edit ] Main article: IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry Basic IUPAC inorganic nomenclature has two main parts: the cation and the anion . The cation is the name for the positively charged ion and the anion is the name for the negatively charged ion.

[ 14 ] An example of IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry is potassium chlorate (KClO 3 ): Potassium chlorate " Potassium " is the cation name.

" Chlorate " is the anion name.

[ 14 ] Amino acid and nucleotide base codes [ edit ] IUPAC also has a system for giving codes to identify amino acids and nucleotide bases. IUPAC needed a coding system that represented long sequences of amino acids. This would allow for these sequences to be compared to try to find homologies .

[ 32 ] These codes can consist of either a one-letter code or a three-letter code.

These codes make it easier and shorter to write down the amino acid sequences that make up proteins . The nucleotide bases are made up of purines ( adenine and guanine ) and pyrimidines ( cytosine and thymine or uracil ). These nucleotide bases make up DNA and RNA . These nucleotide base codes make the genome of an organism much smaller and easier to read.

[ 52 ] Colored cover book and website series (nomenclature) [ edit ] Main article: IUPAC book IUPAC color code their books in order to make each publication distinguishable.

[ 11 ] Title Description Compendium of Analytical Nomenclature One extensive book on almost all nomenclature written (IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry and IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry) by IUPAC committee is the Compendium of Analytical Nomenclature (the "Orange Book"; 1st edition 1978).

[ 53 ] This book was revised in 1987. The second edition has many revisions that come from reports on nomenclature between 1976 and 1984.

[ 54 ] In 1992, the second edition went through many different revisions, which led to the third edition.

[ 54 ] Pure and Applied Chemistry (journal) Pure and Applied Chemistry is the official monthly journal of IUPAC. This journal debuted in 1960. The goal statement for Pure and Applied Chemistry is to "publish highly topical and credible works at the forefront of all aspects of pure and applied chemistry." [ 55 ] The journal itself is available by subscription, but older issues are available in the archive on IUPAC's website.

Pure and Applied Chemistry was created as a central way to publish IUPAC endorsed articles.

[ 56 ] Before its creation, IUPAC did not have a quick, official way to distribute new chemistry information.

Its creation was first suggested at the Paris IUPAC Meeting of 1957.

[ 56 ] During this meeting the commercial publisher of the journal was discussed and decided on. In 1959, the IUPAC Pure and Applied Chemistry Editorial Advisory Board was created and put in charge of the journal. The idea of one journal being a definitive place for a vast amount of chemistry was difficult for the committee to grasp at first.

[ 56 ] However, it was decided that the journal would reprint old journal editions to keep all chemistry knowledge available.

Compendium of Chemical Terminology The Compendium of Chemical Terminology , also known as the "Gold Book", was originally worked on by Victor Gold . This book is a collection of names and terms already discussed in Pure and Applied Chemistry .

[ 57 ] The Compendium of Chemical Terminology was first published in 1987.

[ 11 ] The first edition of this book contains no original material, but is meant to be a compilation of other IUPAC works.

The second edition of this book was published in 1997.

[ 31 ] This book made large changes to the first edition of the Compendium of Chemical Terminology . These changes included updated material and an expansion of the book to include over seven thousand terms.

[ 31 ] The second edition was the topic of an IUPAC XML project. This project made an XML version of the book that includes over seven thousand terms. The XML version of the book includes an open editing policy, which allows users to add excerpts of the written version.

[ 31 ] IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry (online publication) IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry , also known as the "Blue Book", is a website published by the Advanced Chemistry Department Incorporated with the permission of IUPAC. This site is a compilation of the books A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds and Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry .

[ 58 ] International Year of Chemistry [ edit ] International Year of Chemistry logo IUPAC and UNESCO were the lead organizations coordinating events for the International Year of Chemistry , which took place in 2011.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] The International Year of Chemistry was originally proposed by IUPAC at the general assembly in Turin , Italy.

[ 61 ] This motion was adopted by UNESCO at a meeting in 2008.

[ 61 ] The main objectives of the International Year of Chemistry were to increase public appreciation of chemistry and gain more interest in the world of chemistry . This event is also being held to encourage young people to get involved and contribute to chemistry. A further reason for this event being held is to honour how chemistry has made improvements to everyone's way of life.

[ 12 ] IUPAC Presidents [ edit ] IUPAC Presidents are elected by the IUPAC Council during the General Assembly. Below is the list of IUPAC Presidents since its inception in 1919.
