For other uses, see Degree (disambiguation) .

A degree two map of a sphere onto itself.

In topology , the degree of a continuous mapping between two compact oriented manifolds of the same dimension is a number that represents the number of times that the domain manifold wraps around the range manifold under the mapping. The degree is always an integer , but may be positive or negative depending on the orientations.

The degree of a map between general manifolds was first defined by Brouwer , [ 1 ] who showed that the degree is homotopy invariant and used it to prove the Brouwer fixed point theorem . Less general forms of the concept existed before Brouwer, such as the winding number and the Kronecker characteristic (or Kronecker integral ).

[ 2 ] In modern mathematics, the degree of a map plays an important role in topology and geometry . In physics , the degree of a continuous map (for instance a map from space to some order parameter set) is one example of a topological quantum number .

Definitions of the degree [ edit ] From S n to S n [ edit ] The simplest and most important case is the degree of a continuous map from the n {\displaystyle n} -sphere S n {\displaystyle S^{n}} to itself (in the case n = 1 {\displaystyle n=1} , this is called the winding number): Let f : : S n → → S n {\displaystyle f\colon S^{n}\to S^{n}} be a continuous map. Then f {\displaystyle f} induces a pushforward homomorphism f ∗ ∗ : : H n ( S n ) → → H n ( S n ) {\displaystyle f_{*}\colon H_{n}\left(S^{n}\right)\to H_{n}\left(S^{n}\right)} , where H n ( ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle H_{n}\left(\cdot \right)} is the n {\displaystyle n} th homology group . Considering the fact that H n ( S n ) ≅ ≅ Z {\displaystyle H_{n}\left(S^{n}\right)\cong \mathbb {Z} } , we see that f ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle f_{*}} must be of the form f ∗ ∗ : : x ↦ ↦ α α x {\displaystyle f_{*}\colon x\mapsto \alpha x} for some fixed α α ∈ ∈ Z {\displaystyle \alpha \in \mathbb {Z} } .
This α α {\displaystyle \alpha } is then called the degree of f {\displaystyle f} .

Between manifolds [ edit ] Algebraic topology [ edit ] Let X and Y be closed connected oriented m -dimensional manifolds .

Poincare duality implies that the manifold's top homology group is isomorphic to Z . Choosing an orientation means choosing a generator of the top homology group.

A continuous map f : X → Y induces a homomorphism f ∗ from H m ( X ) to H m ( Y ). Let [ X ], resp. [ Y ] be the chosen generator of H m ( X ), resp.

H m ( Y ) (or the fundamental class of X , Y ). Then the degree of f is defined to be f * ([ X ]). In other words, f ∗ ∗ ( [ X ] ) = deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f ) [ Y ] .

{\displaystyle f_{*}([X])=\deg(f)[Y]\,.} If y in Y and f −1 ( y ) is a finite set, the degree of f can be computed by considering the m -th local homology groups of X at each point in f −1 ( y ). Namely, if f − − 1 ( y ) = { x 1 , … … , x m } {\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)=\{x_{1},\dots ,x_{m}\}} , then deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f ) = ∑ ∑ i = 1 m deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f | x i ) .

{\displaystyle \deg(f)=\sum _{i=1}^{m}\deg(f|_{x_{i}})\,.} Differential topology [ edit ] In the language of differential topology , the degree of a smooth map can be defined as follows: If f is a smooth map whose domain is a compact manifold and p is a regular value of f , consider the finite set f − − 1 ( p ) = { x 1 , x 2 , … … , x n } .

{\displaystyle f^{-1}(p)=\{x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}\}\,.} By p being a regular value, in a neighborhood of each x i the map f is a local diffeomorphism . Diffeomorphisms can be either orientation preserving or orientation reversing. Let r be the number of points x i at which f is orientation preserving  and s be the number at which f is orientation reversing. When the codomain of f is connected, the number r − s is independent of the choice of p (though n is not!) and one defines the degree of f to be r − s . This definition coincides with the algebraic topological definition above.

The same definition works for compact manifolds with boundary but then f should send the boundary of X to the boundary of Y .

One can also define degree modulo 2 (deg 2 ( f )) the same way as before but taking the fundamental class in Z 2 homology. In this case deg 2 ( f ) is an element of Z 2 (the field with two elements ), the manifolds need not be orientable and if n is the number of preimages of p as before then deg 2 ( f ) is n modulo 2.

Integration of differential forms gives a pairing between (C ∞ -) singular homology and de Rham cohomology : ⟨ ⟨ c , ω ω ⟩ ⟩ = ∫ ∫ c ω ω {\textstyle \langle c,\omega \rangle =\int _{c}\omega } , where c {\displaystyle c} is a homology class represented by a cycle c {\displaystyle c} and ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } a closed form representing a de Rham cohomology class. For a smooth map f : X → Y between orientable m -manifolds, one has ⟨ f ∗ ∗ [ c ] , [ ω ω ] ⟩ = ⟨ [ c ] , f ∗ ∗ [ ω ω ] ⟩ , {\displaystyle \left\langle f_{*}[c],[\omega ]\right\rangle =\left\langle [c],f^{*}[\omega ]\right\rangle ,} where f ∗ and f ∗ are induced maps on chains and forms respectively. Since f ∗ [ X ] = deg f · [ Y ], we have deg ⁡ ⁡ f ∫ ∫ Y ω ω = ∫ ∫ X f ∗ ∗ ω ω {\displaystyle \deg f\int _{Y}\omega =\int _{X}f^{*}\omega \,} for any m -form ω on Y .

Maps from closed region [ edit ] If Ω Ω ⊂ ⊂ R n {\displaystyle \Omega \subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is a bounded region , f : Ω Ω ¯ ¯ → → R n {\displaystyle f:{\bar {\Omega }}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} smooth, p {\displaystyle p} a regular value of f {\displaystyle f} and p ∉ ∉ f ( ∂ ∂ Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle p\notin f(\partial \Omega )} , then the degree deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f , Ω Ω , p ) {\displaystyle \deg(f,\Omega ,p)} is defined by the formula deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f , Ω Ω , p ) := ∑ ∑ y ∈ ∈ f − − 1 ( p ) sgn ⁡ ⁡ det ( D f ( y ) ) {\displaystyle \deg(f,\Omega ,p):=\sum _{y\in f^{-1}(p)}\operatorname {sgn} \det(Df(y))} where D f ( y ) {\displaystyle Df(y)} is the Jacobian matrix of f {\displaystyle f} in y {\displaystyle y} .

This definition of the degree may be naturally extended for non-regular values p {\displaystyle p} such that deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f , Ω Ω , p ) = deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f , Ω Ω , p ′ ) {\displaystyle \deg(f,\Omega ,p)=\deg \left(f,\Omega ,p'\right)} where p ′ {\displaystyle p'} is a point close to p {\displaystyle p} . The topological degree can also be calculated using a surface integral over the boundary of Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } , [ 3 ] and if Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is a connected n - polytope , then the degree can be expressed as a sum of determinants over a certain subdivision of its facets .

[ 4 ] The degree satisfies the following properties: [ 5 ] If deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f , Ω Ω ¯ ¯ , p ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \deg \left(f,{\bar {\Omega }},p\right)\neq 0} , then there exists x ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle x\in \Omega } such that f ( x ) = p {\displaystyle f(x)=p} .

deg ⁡ ⁡ ( id , Ω Ω , y ) = 1 {\displaystyle \deg(\operatorname {id} ,\Omega ,y)=1} for all y ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle y\in \Omega } .

Decomposition property: deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f , Ω Ω , y ) = deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f , Ω Ω 1 , y ) + deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f , Ω Ω 2 , y ) , {\displaystyle \deg(f,\Omega ,y)=\deg(f,\Omega _{1},y)+\deg(f,\Omega _{2},y),} if Ω Ω 1 , Ω Ω 2 {\displaystyle \Omega _{1},\Omega _{2}} are disjoint parts of Ω Ω = Ω Ω 1 ∪ ∪ Ω Ω 2 {\displaystyle \Omega =\Omega _{1}\cup \Omega _{2}} and y ∉ f ( Ω Ω ¯ ¯ ∖ ∖ ( Ω Ω 1 ∪ ∪ Ω Ω 2 ) ) {\displaystyle y\not \in f{\left({\overline {\Omega }}\setminus \left(\Omega _{1}\cup \Omega _{2}\right)\right)}} .

Homotopy invariance : If f {\displaystyle f} and g {\displaystyle g} are homotopy equivalent via a homotopy F ( t ) {\displaystyle F(t)} such that F ( 0 ) = f , F ( 1 ) = g {\displaystyle F(0)=f,\,F(1)=g} and p ∉ ∉ F ( t ) ( ∂ ∂ Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle p\notin F(t)(\partial \Omega )} , then deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f , Ω Ω , p ) = deg ⁡ ⁡ ( g , Ω Ω , p ) {\displaystyle \deg(f,\Omega ,p)=\deg(g,\Omega ,p)} .

The function p ↦ ↦ deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f , Ω Ω , p ) {\displaystyle p\mapsto \deg(f,\Omega ,p)} is locally constant on R n − − f ( ∂ ∂ Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}-f(\partial \Omega )} .

These properties characterise the degree uniquely and the degree may be defined by them in an axiomatic way.

In a similar way, we could define the degree of a map between compact oriented manifolds with boundary .

Properties [ edit ] The degree of a map is a homotopy invariant; moreover for continuous maps from the sphere to itself it is a complete homotopy invariant, i.e. two maps f , g : S n → → S n {\displaystyle f,g:S^{n}\to S^{n}\,} are homotopic if and only if deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f ) = deg ⁡ ⁡ ( g ) {\displaystyle \deg(f)=\deg(g)} .

In other words, degree is an isomorphism between [ S n , S n ] = π π n S n {\displaystyle \left[S^{n},S^{n}\right]=\pi _{n}S^{n}} and Z {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} } .

Moreover, the Hopf theorem states that for any n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional closed oriented manifold M , two maps f , g : M → → S n {\displaystyle f,g:M\to S^{n}} are homotopic if and only if deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f ) = deg ⁡ ⁡ ( g ) .

{\displaystyle \deg(f)=\deg(g).} A self-map f : S n → → S n {\displaystyle f:S^{n}\to S^{n}} of the n -sphere is extendable to a map F : B n + 1 → → S n {\displaystyle F:B_{n+1}\to S^{n}} from the n+1 -ball to the n -sphere if and only if deg ⁡ ⁡ ( f ) = 0 {\displaystyle \deg(f)=0} .  (Here the function F extends f in the sense that f is the restriction of F to S n {\displaystyle S^{n}} .) Calculating the degree [ edit ] There is an algorithm for calculating the topological degree deg( f , B , 0) of a continuous function f from an n -dimensional box B (a product of n intervals) to R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , where f is given in the form of arithmetical expressions.

[ 6 ] An implementation of the algorithm is available in TopDeg - a software tool for computing the degree (LGPL-3).
