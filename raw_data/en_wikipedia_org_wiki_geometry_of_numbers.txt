Typically, a ring of algebraic integers is viewed as a lattice in R n , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},} and the study of these lattices provides fundamental information on algebraic numbers.

[ 1 ] Hermann Minkowski ( 1896 ) initiated this line of research at the age of 26 in his work The Geometry of Numbers .

[ 2 ] Best rational approximants for π (green circle), e (blue diamond), φ (pink oblong), (√3)/2 (grey hexagon), 1/√2 (red octagon) and 1/√3 (orange triangle) calculated from their continued fraction expansions, plotted as slopes y / x with errors from their true values (black dashes) v t e The geometry of numbers has a close relationship with other fields of mathematics, especially functional analysis and Diophantine approximation , the problem of finding rational numbers that  approximate an irrational quantity .

[ 3 ] Minkowski's results [ edit ] Main article: Minkowski's theorem Suppose that Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is a lattice in n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and K {\displaystyle K} is a convex centrally symmetric body.

Minkowski's theorem , sometimes called Minkowski's first theorem, states that if vol ⁡ ⁡ ( K ) > 2 n vol ⁡ ⁡ ( R n / Γ Γ ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {vol} (K)>2^{n}\operatorname {vol} (\mathbb {R} ^{n}/\Gamma )} , then K {\displaystyle K} contains a nonzero vector in Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } .

Main article: Minkowski's second theorem The successive minimum λ λ k {\displaystyle \lambda _{k}} is defined to be the inf of the numbers λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } such that λ λ K {\displaystyle \lambda K} contains k {\displaystyle k} linearly independent vectors of Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } .
Minkowski's theorem on successive minima , sometimes called Minkowski's second theorem , is a strengthening of his first theorem and states that [ 4 ] λ λ 1 λ λ 2 ⋯ ⋯ λ λ n vol ⁡ ⁡ ( K ) ≤ ≤ 2 n vol ⁡ ⁡ ( R n / Γ Γ ) .

{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}\lambda _{2}\cdots \lambda _{n}\operatorname {vol} (K)\leq 2^{n}\operatorname {vol} (\mathbb {R} ^{n}/\Gamma ).} Later research in the geometry of numbers [ edit ] In 1930–1960 research on the geometry of numbers was conducted by many number theorists (including Louis Mordell , Harold Davenport and Carl Ludwig Siegel ). In recent years, Lenstra, Brion, and Barvinok have developed combinatorial theories that enumerate the lattice points in some convex bodies.

[ 5 ] Subspace theorem of W. M. Schmidt [ edit ] Main article: Subspace theorem See also: Siegel's lemma , volume (mathematics) , determinant , and parallelepiped In the geometry of numbers, the subspace theorem was obtained by Wolfgang M. Schmidt in 1972.

[ 6 ] It states that if n is a positive integer, and L 1 ,..., L n are linearly independent linear forms in n variables with algebraic coefficients and if ε>0 is any given real number, then the non-zero integer points x in n coordinates with | L 1 ( x ) ⋯ ⋯ L n ( x ) | < | x | − − ε ε {\displaystyle |L_{1}(x)\cdots L_{n}(x)|<|x|^{-\varepsilon }} lie in a finite number of proper subspaces of Q n .

Influence on functional analysis [ edit ] Main article: normed vector space See also: Banach space and F-space Minkowski's geometry of numbers had a profound influence on functional analysis . Minkowski proved that symmetric convex bodies induce norms in finite-dimensional vector spaces. Minkowski's theorem was generalized to topological vector spaces by Kolmogorov , whose theorem states that the symmetric convex sets that are closed and bounded generate the topology of a Banach space .

[ 7 ] Researchers continue to study generalizations to star-shaped sets and other non-convex sets .
