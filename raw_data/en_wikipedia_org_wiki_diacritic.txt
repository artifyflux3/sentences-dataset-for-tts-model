Latin letter A with multiple diacritics

A **diacritic** (also **diacritical mark**, **diacritical point**, **diacritical sign**, or **accent**) is a [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph") added to a [letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(alphabet) "Letter (alphabet)") or to a basic glyph. The term derives from the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek")[διακριτικός](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:διακριτικός") (_diakritikós_, "distinguishing"), from διακρίνω (_diakrínō_, "to distinguish"). The word _diacritic_ is a [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun"), though it is sometimes used in an [attributive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_adjunct "Noun adjunct") sense, whereas _diacritical_ is only an [adjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective "Adjective"). Some diacritics, such as the [acute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent "Acute accent")⟨ó⟩, [grave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent "Grave accent")⟨ò⟩, and [circumflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex "Circumflex")⟨ô⟩ (all shown above an 'o'), are often called _accents_. Diacritics may appear above or below a letter or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters.

The main use of diacritics in [Latin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script "Latin script") is to change the sound-values of the letters to which they are added. Historically, English has used the [diaeresis diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaeresis_(diacritic) "Diaeresis (diacritic)") to indicate the correct pronunciation of ambiguous words, such as "coöperate", without which the <oo> letter sequence could be misinterpreted to be pronounced /ˈkuːpəreɪt/. Other examples are the acute and grave accents, which can indicate that a vowel is to be pronounced differently than is normal in that position, for example not reduced to /ə/ or silent as in the case of the two uses of the letter e in the noun _[résumé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9 "Résumé")_ (as opposed to the verb _resume_) and the help sometimes provided in the pronunciation of some words such as _doggèd_, _learnèd_, _blessèd_, and especially words pronounced differently than normal in poetry (for example _movèd_, _breathèd_).

Most other words with diacritics in English are [borrowings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_word "Loan word") from languages such as [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") to better preserve the spelling, such as the diaeresis on _naïve_ and _Noël_, the [acute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(diacritic) "Acute (diacritic)") from _café_, the [circumflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex "Circumflex") in the word _crêpe_, and the [cedille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedille "Cedille") in _façade_. All these diacritics, however, are frequently omitted in writing, and English is the only major modern [European language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe "Languages of Europe") that does not have diacritics in common usage.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-2)

In [Latin-script alphabets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-script_alphabet "Latin-script alphabet") in other languages diacritics may distinguish between [homonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym "Homonym"), such as the [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language")_là_ ("there") versus _la_ ("the"), which are both pronounced /la/. In [Gaelic type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_type "Gaelic type"), a dot over a consonant indicates [lenition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition "Lenition") of the consonant in question. In other [writing systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_systems "Writing systems"), diacritics may perform other functions. [Vowel pointing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_pointing_(disambiguation) "Vowel pointing (disambiguation)") systems, namely the [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language")[harakat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_diacritics "Arabic diacritics") and the [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language")[niqqud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud "Niqqud") systems, indicate vowels that are not conveyed by the basic alphabet. The [Indic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indic_script "Indic script")[virama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virama "Virama") ( ् etc.) and the Arabic [sukūn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suk%C5%ABn "Sukūn") ( ـْـ ) mark the absence of vowels. [Cantillation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_cantillation "Hebrew cantillation") indicate [prosody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics) "Prosody (linguistics)"). Other uses include the [Early Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Cyrillic "Early Cyrillic")[titlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titlo "Titlo") stroke ( ◌҃ ) and the Hebrew [gershayim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershayim "Gershayim") ( ״ ), which, respectively, mark [abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation "Abbreviation") or [acronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym"), and Greek diacritical marks, which showed that letters of the alphabet were being used as [numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals "Greek numerals"). In [Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language "Vietnamese language") and the [Hanyu Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin") official romanization system for Mandarin in China, diacritics are used to mark the [tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese_phonology#Tones "Standard Chinese phonology") of the syllables in which the marked vowels occur.

In [orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography") and [collation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation "Collation"), a letter modified by a diacritic may be treated either as a new, distinct letter or as a letter–diacritic combination. This varies from language to language and may vary from case to case within a language.

In some cases, letters are used as "in-line diacritics", with the same function as ancillary glyphs, in that they modify the sound of the letter preceding them, as in the case of the "h" in the English pronunciation of "sh" and "th".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-3) Such letter combinations are sometimes even collated as a single distinct letter. For example, the spelling sch was traditionally often treated as a separate letter in German. Words with that spelling were listed after all other words spelled with s in card catalogs in the Vienna public libraries, for example (before digitization).

Larger renditions of these glyphs are given at [§List of diacritics in Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#List_of_diacritics_in_Unicode), below

The tilde, dot, comma, [titlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titlo "Titlo"), apostrophe, bar, and colon are sometimes diacritical marks, but also have other uses.

Not all diacritics occur adjacent to the letter they modify. In the [Wali language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wali_language_(Gur) "Wali language (Gur)") of Ghana, for example, an apostrophe indicates a change of vowel quality, but occurs at the beginning of the word, as in the dialects _’Bulengee_ and _’Dolimi_. Because of [vowel harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_harmony "Vowel harmony"), all vowels in a word are affected, so the scope of the diacritic is the entire word. In [abugida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida "Abugida") scripts, like those used to write [Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi "Hindi") and [Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language "Thai language"), diacritics indicate vowels, and may occur above, below, before, after, or around the consonant letter they modify.

The [tittle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tittle "Tittle") (dot) on the letter ⟨i⟩ or the letter ⟨j⟩, of the Latin alphabet originated as a diacritic to clearly distinguish ⟨i⟩ from the [minims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minim_(palaeography) "Minim (palaeography)") (downstrokes) of adjacent letters. It first appeared in the 11th century in the sequence _ii_ (as in _ingeníí_), then spread to _i_ adjacent to _m, n, u_, and finally to all lowercase _i_ s. The ⟨j⟩, originally a variant of _i_, inherited the tittle. The shape of the diacritic developed from initially resembling today's acute accent to a long flourish by the 15th century. With the advent of [Roman type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_type "Roman type") it was reduced to the round dot we have today.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-4)

Several languages of eastern Europe use diacritics on both consonants and vowels, whereas in western Europe [digraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(orthography) "Digraph (orthography)") are more often used to change consonant sounds. Most languages in Europe use diacritics on vowels, aside from English where there are typically none (with [some exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_terms_with_diacritical_marks "English terms with diacritical marks")).

Diacritics specific to non-Latin alphabets
------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diacritic&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Diacritics specific to non-Latin alphabets")]

*   (ئ ؤ إ أ and stand alone ء) _[hamza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza "Hamza")_: indicates a [glottal stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop "Glottal stop").
*   (ــًــٍــٌـ) _tanwīn_ (تنوين) symbols: Serve a grammatical role in [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"). The sign ـً is most commonly written in combination with [alif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph "Aleph"), e.g. ـًا.
*   (ــّـ) _[shadda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadda "Shadda")_: Gemination (doubling) of consonants.
*   (ٱ) _waṣla_: Comes most commonly at the beginning of a word. Indicates a type of _hamza_ that is pronounced only when the letter is read at the beginning of the talk.
*   (آ) _madda_: A written replacement for a _hamza_ that is followed by an alif, i.e. (ءا). Read as a glottal stop followed by a long /aː/, e.g. ءاداب، ءاية، قرءان، مرءاة are written out respectively as آداب، آية، قرآن، مرآة. This writing rule does not apply when the alif that follows a _hamza_ is not a part of the stem of the word, e.g. نتوءات is not written out as نتوآت as the stem نتوء does not have an alif that follows its _hamza_.
*   (ــٰـ) _superscript alif_ (also "short" or "dagger alif": A replacement for an original alif that is dropped in the writing out of some rare words, e.g. لاكن is not written out with the original alif found in the word pronunciation, instead it is written out as لٰكن.
*   _ḥarakāt_ (In Arabic: حركات also called تشكيل _tashkīl_): 
    *   (ــَـ) _fatḥa_ (a)
    *   (ــِـ) _kasra_ (i)
    *   (ــُـ) _ḍamma_ (u)
    *   (ــْـ) _sukūn_ (no vowel)

*   The _ḥarakāt_ or vowel points serve two purposes: 
    *   They serve as a phonetic guide. They indicate the presence of short vowels (_fatḥa_, _kasra_, or _ḍamma_) or their absence (_sukūn_).
    *   At the last letter of a word, the vowel point reflects the [inflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection "Inflection") case or [conjugation mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjugation "Grammatical conjugation"). 
        *   For nouns, The _ḍamma_ is for the nominative, _fatḥa_ for the accusative, and _kasra_ for the genitive.
        *   For verbs, the _ḍamma_ is for the imperfective, _fatḥa_ for the perfective, and the _sukūn_ is for verbs in the imperative or [jussive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussive "Jussive") moods.

*   Vowel points or _tashkīl_ should not be confused with consonant points or _[iʿjam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic\_diacritics "Arabic diacritics")_ (إعجام) – one, two or three dots written above or below a consonant to distinguish between letters of the same or similar [form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasm "Rasm").

These diacritics are used in addition to the acute, grave, and circumflex accents and the diaeresis:

The diacritics **〮** and **〯**, known as Bangjeom (방점; 傍點), were used to mark pitch accents in [Hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul "Hangul") for [Middle Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Korean "Middle Korean"). They were written to the left of a syllable in vertical writing and above a syllable in horizontal writing.

*   A [tilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde "Tilde") (~) under _Kaph_ represent a [t͡ʃ] sound, transliterated as _ch_ or _č_,
*   A semicircle under _Peh_ represents an [f] sound, transliterated as _f_ or _ph_.

In addition to the above vowel marks, transliteration of Syriac sometimes includes _ə_, _e̊_ or superscript _e_ (or often nothing at all) to represent an original Aramaic [schwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa "Schwa") that became lost later on at some point in the development of Syriac.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-5) Some transliteration schemes find its inclusion necessary for showing spirantization or for historical reasons.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-6)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-7)

Non-alphabetic scripts
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diacritic&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Non-alphabetic scripts")]

Some non-alphabetic scripts also employ symbols that function essentially as diacritics.

*   Non-pure [abjads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad "Abjad") (such as [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language") and [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") script) and [abugidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida "Abugida") use diacritics for denoting [vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel "Vowel"). Hebrew and Arabic also indicate consonant doubling and change with diacritics; Hebrew and [Devanagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari "Devanagari") use them for foreign sounds. Devanagari and related abugidas also use a diacritical mark called a _[virama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virama "Virama")_ to mark the absence of a vowel. In addition, Devanagari uses the moon-dot _[chandrabindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrabindu "Chandrabindu")_ (**ँ**) for vowel nasalization.
*   [Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Canadian_Aboriginal_Syllabics "Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics") use several types of diacritics, including the diacritics with alphabetic properties known as Medials and Finals. Although long vowels originally were indicated with a negative line through the Syllabic glyphs, making the glyph appear broken, in the modern forms, a [dot above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_above "Dot above") is used to indicate vowel length. In some of the styles, a [ring above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_above "Ring above") indicates a long vowel with a [j] off-glide. Another diacritic, the "inner ring" is placed at the glyph's head to modify [p] to [f] and [t] to [θ]. Medials such as the "w-dot" placed next to the Syllabics glyph indicates a [w] being placed between the syllable onset consonant and the nucleus vowel. Finals indicate the syllable coda consonant; some of the syllable coda consonants in word medial positions, such as with the "h-tick", indicate the fortification of the consonant in the syllable following it.
*   The Japanese _[hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana "Hiragana")_ and _[katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana")_[syllabaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary "Syllabary") use the [_dakuten_ (◌゛) and _handakuten_ (◌゜)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakuten "Dakuten") (in Japanese: 濁点 and 半濁点) symbols, also known as _nigori_ (濁 "muddying") or _ten-ten_ (点々 "dot dot") and _maru_ (丸 "circle"), to indicate [voiced consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_consonant "Voiced consonant") or other phonetic changes.
*   [Emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon "Emoticon") are commonly created with diacritic symbols, especially [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") emoticons on popular [imageboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboards "Imageboards").

Alphabetization or collation
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diacritic&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Alphabetization or collation")]

Different languages use different rules to put diacritic characters in [alphabetical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet "Alphabet") order. For example, French and Portuguese treat letters with diacritical marks the same as the underlying letter for purposes of ordering and dictionaries. The [Scandinavian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_languages "Scandinavian languages") and the [Finnish language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language "Finnish language"), by contrast, treat the characters with diacritics ⟨å⟩, ⟨ä⟩, and ⟨ö⟩ as distinct letters of the alphabet, and sort them after ⟨z⟩. Usually ⟨ä⟩ (a-umlaut) and ⟨ö⟩ (o-umlaut) [used in Swedish and Finnish] are sorted as equivalent to ⟨æ⟩ (ash) and ⟨ø⟩ (o-slash) [used in Danish and Norwegian]. Also, _aa_, when used as an alternative spelling to ⟨å⟩, is sorted as such. Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter, with the exception that ⟨ü⟩ is frequently sorted as ⟨y⟩.

Languages that treat accented letters as variants of the underlying letter usually alphabetize words with such symbols immediately after similar unmarked words. For instance, in German where two words differ only by an umlaut, the word without it is sorted first in German dictionaries (e.g. _schon_ and then _schön_, or _fallen_ and then _fällen_). However, when names are concerned (e.g. in phone books or in author catalogues in libraries), umlauts are often treated as combinations of the vowel with a suffixed ⟨e⟩; Austrian phone books now treat characters with umlauts as separate letters (immediately following the underlying vowel).

In Spanish, the grapheme ⟨ñ⟩ is considered a distinct letter, different from ⟨n⟩ and collated between ⟨n⟩ and ⟨o⟩, as it denotes a different sound from that of a plain ⟨n⟩. But the accented vowels ⟨á⟩, ⟨é⟩, ⟨í⟩, ⟨ó⟩, ⟨ú⟩ are not separated from the unaccented vowels ⟨a⟩, ⟨e⟩, ⟨i⟩, ⟨o⟩, ⟨u⟩, as the acute accent in Spanish only modifies [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics) "Stress (linguistics)") within the word or denotes a distinction between [homonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym "Homonym"), and does not modify the sound of a letter.

For a comprehensive list of the collating orders in various languages, see [Collating sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collating_sequence "Collating sequence").

Generation with computers

German keyboard with umlaut letters

Modern computer technology was developed mostly in countries that speak Western European languages (particularly English), and many early binary encodings were developed with a bias favoring English—a language written without diacritical marks. With [computer memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory "Computer memory") and [computer storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_storage "Computer storage") at premium, early [character sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_set "Character set") were limited to the Latin alphabet, the ten digits and a few punctuation marks and conventional symbols. The American Standard Code for Information Interchange ([ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII")), first published in 1963, encoded just 95 printable characters. It included just four free-standing diacritics—acute, grave, circumflex and tilde—which were to be used by backspacing and overprinting the base letter. The [ISO/IEC 646](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_646 "ISO/IEC 646") standard (1967) defined national variations that replace some American graphemes with [precomposed characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomposed_character "Precomposed character") (such as ⟨é⟩, ⟨è⟩ and ⟨ë⟩), according to language—but remained limited to 95 printable characters.

[Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") was conceived to solve this problem by assigning every known character its own code; if this code is known, most modern computer systems provide a [method to input it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#Input_methods "Unicode"). For historical reasons, almost all the letter-with-accent combinations used in European languages were given unique [code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point") and these are called [precomposed characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomposed_character "Precomposed character"). For other languages, it is usually necessary to use a [combining character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character "Combining character") diacritic together with the desired base letter. Unfortunately, even as of 2024, many applications and web browsers remain unable to operate the combining diacritic concept properly.

Depending on the [keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout "Keyboard layout") and [keyboard mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_mapping "Keyboard mapping"), it is more or less easy to enter letters with diacritics on computers and typewriters. Keyboards used in countries where letters with diacritics are the norm, have keys engraved with the relevant symbols. In other cases, such as when the [US international](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_international "US international") or [UK extended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_extended "UK extended") mappings are used, the accented letter is created by first pressing the key with the diacritic mark, followed by the letter to place it on. This method is known as the [dead key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key "Dead key") technique, as it produces no output of its own but modifies the output of the key pressed after it.

Languages with letters containing diacritics
--------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diacritic&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Languages with letters containing diacritics")]

The following languages have letters with diacritics that are orthographically distinct from those without diacritics.

*   [Latvian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_alphabet "Latvian alphabet") has the following letters: ⟨[ā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80 "Ā")⟩, ⟨[ē](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%92 "Ē")⟩, ⟨[ī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%AA "Ī")⟩, ⟨[ū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%AA "Ū")⟩, ⟨[č](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8C "Č")⟩, ⟨[ģ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A2 "Ģ")⟩, ⟨[ķ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B6 "Ķ")⟩, ⟨[ļ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%BB "Ļ")⟩, ⟨[ņ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%85 "Ņ")⟩, ⟨[š](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0 "Š")⟩, ⟨[ž](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BD "Ž")⟩
*   [Lithuanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_alphabet "Lithuanian alphabet"). In general usage, where letters appear with the caron (⟨č⟩, ⟨š⟩ and ⟨ž⟩), they are considered as separate letters from ⟨c⟩, ⟨s⟩ or ⟨z⟩ and collated separately; letters with the [ogonek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogonek "Ogonek") (⟨[ą](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%84 "Ą")⟩, ⟨[ę](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%98 "Ę")⟩, ⟨[į](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%AE "Į")⟩ and ⟨[ų](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%B2 "Ų")⟩), the [macron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron_(diacritic) "Macron (diacritic)") (⟨[ū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%AA "Ū")⟩) and the [overdot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdot "Overdot") (⟨[ė](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%96 "Ė")⟩) are considered as separate letters as well, but not given a unique collation order.

*   [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language "Welsh language") uses the circumflex, diaeresis, acute, and grave accents on its seven vowels ⟨a⟩, ⟨e⟩, ⟨i⟩, ⟨o⟩, ⟨u⟩, ⟨w⟩, ⟨y⟩ (hence the composites ⟨â⟩, ⟨ê⟩, ⟨î⟩, ⟨ô⟩, ⟨û⟩, ⟨ŵ⟩, ⟨ŷ⟩, ⟨ä⟩, ⟨ë⟩, ⟨ï⟩, ⟨ö⟩, ⟨ü⟩, ⟨ẅ⟩, ⟨ÿ⟩, ⟨á⟩, ⟨é⟩, ⟨í⟩, ⟨ó⟩, ⟨ú⟩, ⟨ẃ⟩, ⟨ý⟩, ⟨à⟩, ⟨è⟩, ⟨ì⟩, ⟨ò⟩, ⟨ù⟩, ⟨ẁ⟩, ⟨ỳ⟩). However all except the circumflex (which is used as a macron) are fairly rare.
*   Following spelling reforms since the 1970s, [Scottish Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic "Scottish Gaelic") uses graves only, which can be used on any vowel (⟨[à](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80 "À")⟩, ⟨[è](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%88 "È")⟩, ⟨[ì](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8C "Ì")⟩, ⟨[ò](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%92 "Ò")⟩, ⟨[ù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%99 "Ù")⟩). Formerly acute accents could be used on ⟨á⟩, ⟨ó⟩ and ⟨é⟩, which were used to indicate a specific vowel quality. With the elimination of these accents, the new orthography relies on the reader having prior knowledge of pronunciation of a given word.
*   [Manx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_language "Manx language") uses the cedilla diacritic ⟨[ç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87 "Ç")⟩ combined with h to give the digraph ⟨çh⟩ (pronounced /tʃ/) to mark the distinction between it and the digraph ⟨ch⟩ (pronounced /h/ or /x/). Other diacritics used in Manx included the circumflex and diaeresis, as in ⟨â⟩, ⟨ê⟩, ⟨ï⟩, etc. to mark the distinction between two similarly spelled words but with slightly differing pronunciation.
*   [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language "Irish language") uses only acute accents to mark long vowels, following the 1948 spelling reform. [Lenition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition "Lenition") is indicated using an [overdot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdot "Overdot") in [Gaelic type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_type "Gaelic type") (⟨[ċ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8A "Ċ")⟩,⟨ḋ⟩,⟨ḟ⟩, ⟨[ġ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A0 "Ġ")⟩, ⟨ṁ⟩, ⟨ṗ⟩, ⟨[ṡ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%B9%A0 "Ṡ")⟩, ⟨ṫ⟩); in [Roman type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_type "Roman type"), a suffixed ⟨h⟩ is used. Thus, _a ṁáṫair_ is equivalent to _a mháthair_.
*   [Breton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton_orthography "Breton orthography") does not have a single orthography (spelling system), but uses diacritics for a number of purposes. The diaeresis is used to mark that two vowels are pronounced separately and not as a diphthong/digraph. The circumflex is used to mark long vowels, but usually only when the vowel length is not predictable by phonology. Nasalization of vowels may be marked with a tilde, or following the vowel with the letter ⟨ñ⟩. The plural suffix -où is used as a unified spelling to represent a suffix with a number of pronunciations in different dialects, and to distinguish this suffix from the digraph ⟨ou⟩ which is pronounced as /u:/. An apostrophe is used to distinguish ⟨c'h⟩, pronounced /x/ as the digraph ⟨ch⟩ is used in other Celtic languages, from the French-influenced digraph ch, pronounced /ʃ/.

*   [Estonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_alphabet "Estonian alphabet") has a distinct letter ⟨[õ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%95 "Õ")⟩, which contains a tilde. Estonian vowels with [double-dot diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dot_(diacritic) "Double dot (diacritic)")⟨ä⟩, ⟨ö⟩, ⟨ü⟩ are similar to German, but these are also distinct letters, unlike [German umlauted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_(diacritic) "Umlaut (diacritic)") letters. All four have their own place in the alphabet, between ⟨w⟩ and ⟨x⟩. [Carons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caron "Caron") in ⟨š⟩ or ⟨ž⟩ appear only in foreign proper names and [loanwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanwords "Loanwords"). Also these are distinct letters, placed in the alphabet between _s_ and _t_.
*   [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_alphabet "Finnish alphabet") uses double-dotted vowels (⟨ä⟩ and ⟨ö⟩). As in Swedish and Estonian, these are regarded as individual letters, rather than 'vowel + diacritic' combinations (as happens in German). It also uses the characters ⟨å⟩, ⟨š⟩ and ⟨ž⟩ in foreign names and loanwords. In the Finnish and Swedish alphabets, ⟨å⟩, ⟨ä⟩ and ⟨ö⟩ collate as separate letters after ⟨z⟩, the others as variants of their base letter.
*   [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_alphabet "Hungarian alphabet") uses the double-dot, the acute and double acute diacritics (the last is unique to Hungarian): (⟨ö⟩, ⟨ü⟩), (⟨á⟩, ⟨é⟩, ⟨í⟩, ⟨ó⟩, ⟨ú⟩) and (⟨ő⟩, ⟨ű⟩). The acute accent indicates the long form of a vowel (in case of ⟨i⟩/⟨í⟩, ⟨o⟩/⟨ó⟩, ⟨u⟩/⟨ú⟩) while the double acute performs the same function for ⟨ö⟩ and ⟨ü⟩. The acute accent can also indicate a different sound (more open, as in case of ⟨a⟩/⟨á⟩, ⟨e⟩/⟨é⟩). Both long and short forms of the vowels are listed separately in the [Hungarian alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_alphabet "Hungarian alphabet"), but members of the pairs ⟨a⟩/⟨á⟩, ⟨e⟩/⟨é⟩, ⟨i⟩/⟨í⟩, ⟨o⟩/⟨ó⟩, ⟨ö⟩/⟨[ő](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%90 "Ő")⟩, ⟨u⟩/⟨ú⟩ and ⟨ü⟩/⟨[ű](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%B0 "Ű")⟩ are collated in dictionaries as the same letter.
*   [Livonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livonian_language "Livonian language") has the following letters: ⟨ā⟩, ⟨ä⟩, ⟨[ǟ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C7%9E "Ǟ")⟩, ⟨[ḑ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%B8%90 "Ḑ")⟩, ⟨ē⟩, ⟨ī⟩, ⟨ļ⟩, ⟨ņ⟩, ⟨ō⟩, ⟨[ȯ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%AE "Ȯ")⟩, ⟨[ȱ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%B0 "Ȱ")⟩, ⟨[õ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%95 "Õ")⟩, ⟨[ȭ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%AC "Ȭ")⟩, ⟨ŗ⟩, ⟨š⟩, ⟨ț⟩, ⟨ū⟩, ⟨ž⟩.

*   [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_orthography "German orthography") uses the [two-dots diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_dots_(diacritic) "Two dots (diacritic)") ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): _[umlaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut\_(diacritic) "Umlaut (diacritic)")_): letters ⟨[ä](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84 "Ä")⟩, ⟨[ö](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96 "Ö")⟩, ⟨[ü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9C "Ü")⟩, used to indicate the [fronting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fronting_(phonology) "Fronting (phonology)") of back vowels (see [umlaut (linguistics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_(linguistics) "Umlaut (linguistics)")).
*   [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_orthography "Dutch orthography") uses acute, circumflex, grave and two-dots diacritics with most vowels and cedilla with c, as in French. This results in ⟨[á](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81 "Á")⟩, ⟨[à](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80 "À")⟩, ⟨[ä](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84 "Ä")⟩, ⟨[é](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89 "É")⟩, ⟨[è](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%88 "È")⟩, ⟨[ê](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8A "Ê")⟩, ⟨[ë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8B "Ë")⟩, ⟨[í](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8D "Í")⟩, ⟨[î](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8E "Î")⟩, ⟨[ï](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8F "Ï")⟩, ⟨[ó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93 "Ó")⟩, ⟨[ô](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%94 "Ô")⟩, ⟨[ö](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96 "Ö")⟩, ⟨[ú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9A "Ú")⟩, ⟨[û](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9B "Û")⟩, ⟨[ü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9C "Ü")⟩ and ⟨[ç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87 "Ç")⟩. This is mostly on words (and names) originating from French (like _crème, café, gêne, façade_). The acute accent is also used to stress the vowel (like _één_). The two-dots diacritic is used as a linguistic diaeresis (a [vowel hiatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_hiatus "Vowel hiatus")) that splits the two vowels, e.g., _reële, reünie, coördinatie_), rather than to indicate a linguistic _umlaut_ as used in German.
*   [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans_alphabet "Afrikaans alphabet") uses 16 additional vowel forms, both uppercase and lowercase: ⟨[á](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81 "Á")⟩, ⟨[ä](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84 "Ä")⟩, ⟨[é](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89 "É")⟩, ⟨[è](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%88 "È")⟩, ⟨[ê](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8A "Ê")⟩, ⟨[ë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8B "Ë")⟩, ⟨[í](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8D "Í")⟩, ⟨[î](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8E "Î")⟩, ⟨[ï](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8F "Ï")⟩, ⟨[ó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93 "Ó")⟩, ⟨[ô](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%94 "Ô")⟩, ⟨[ö](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96 "Ö")⟩, ⟨[ú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9A "Ú")⟩, ⟨[û](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9B "Û")⟩, ⟨[ü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9C "Ü")⟩, ⟨[ý](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9D "Ý")⟩.
*   [Faroese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroese_alphabet "Faroese alphabet") uses acutes and some additional letters. All are considered separate letters and have their own place in the alphabet: ⟨[á](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81 "Á")⟩, ⟨[í](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8D "Í")⟩, ⟨[ó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93 "Ó")⟩, ⟨[ú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9A "Ú")⟩, ⟨[ý](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9D "Ý")⟩ and ⟨[ø](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98 "Ø")⟩.
*   [Icelandic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_orthography "Icelandic orthography") uses acutes and other additional letters. All are considered separate letters, and have their own place in the alphabet: ⟨[á](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81 "Á")⟩, ⟨[é](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89 "É")⟩, ⟨[í](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8D "Í")⟩, ⟨[ó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93 "Ó")⟩, ⟨[ú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9A "Ú")⟩, ⟨[ý](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9D "Ý")⟩ and ⟨[ö](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96 "Ö")⟩.
*   [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_alphabet "Danish alphabet") and [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language "Norwegian language") use additional characters like the o-slash ⟨[ø](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98 "Ø")⟩ and the a-overring ⟨[å](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85 "Å")⟩. These letters come after ⟨z⟩ and ⟨[æ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86 "Æ")⟩ in the order ⟨ø⟩, ⟨å⟩. Historically, the ⟨å⟩ has developed from a ligature by writing a small superscript ⟨a⟩ over a lowercase ⟨a⟩; if an ⟨å⟩ character is unavailable, some Scandinavian languages allow the substitution of a doubled _a_, thus ⟨aa⟩. The Scandinavian languages collate these letters after ⟨z⟩, but have different national [collation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation "Collation") standards.
*   [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_alphabet "Swedish alphabet") uses a-diaeresis (⟨[ä](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84 "Ä")⟩) and o-diaeresis (⟨[ö](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96 "Ö")⟩) in the place of _ash_ (⟨æ⟩) and slashed o (⟨[ø](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98 "Ø")⟩) in addition to the a-overring (⟨å⟩). Historically, the two-dots diacritic for the Swedish letters ⟨ä⟩ and ⟨ö⟩ developed from a small Gothic ⟨e⟩ written above the letters. These letters are collated after ⟨z⟩, in the order ⟨å⟩, ⟨ä⟩, ⟨ö⟩.

*   In [Asturian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturian_language "Asturian language"), [Galician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language "Galician language") and [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_alphabet "Spanish alphabet"), the character ⟨[ñ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%91 "Ñ")⟩ is a letter and collated between _n_ and _o_.
*   [Asturian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturian_language "Asturian language") uses an underdot: ⟨[Ḷ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%B8%B6 "Ḷ")⟩ ([lower case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_case "Lower case"), ⟨ḷ⟩), and ⟨[Ḥ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_glottal_fricative "Voiceless glottal fricative")⟩ ([lower case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_case "Lower case")⟨ḥ⟩)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-8)
*   [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language "Catalan language") uses the acute accent ⟨é⟩, ⟨í⟩, ⟨ó⟩, ⟨ú⟩, the grave accent ⟨à⟩, ⟨è⟩, ⟨ò⟩, the diaeresis ⟨ï⟩, ⟨ü⟩, the cedilla ⟨ç⟩, and the [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct")⟨l·l⟩.

*   In [Valencian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencian_language "Valencian language"), the circumflex ⟨â⟩, ⟨ê⟩, ⟨î⟩, ⟨ô⟩, ⟨û⟩ may also be used.

*   [Corsican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsican_language "Corsican language") uses the following in [its alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsican_alphabet "Corsican alphabet"): ⟨À⟩/⟨à⟩, ⟨È⟩/⟨è⟩, ⟨Ì⟩/⟨ì⟩, ⟨Ò⟩/⟨ò⟩, ⟨Ù⟩/⟨ù⟩.
*   [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") uses four diacritics, appearing on vowels (circumflex, acute, grave, diaeresis) and the cedilla appearing in ⟨ç⟩.
*   [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") uses two diacritics, appearing on vowels (acute, grave)
*   [Leonese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonese_language "Leonese language"): could use ⟨ñ⟩ or ⟨[nn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_digraphs#N "List of Latin digraphs")⟩.
*   [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language") uses a tilde with the vowels ⟨a⟩ and ⟨o⟩ and a cedilla with c.
*   [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_alphabet "Romanian alphabet") uses a [breve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breve "Breve") on the letter _a_ (⟨[ă](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%82 "Ă")⟩) to indicate the sound [schwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa "Schwa")/ə/, as well as a circumflex over the letters _a_ (⟨[â](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%82 "Â")⟩) and _i_ (⟨[î](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8E "Î")⟩) for the sound /ɨ/. Romanian also writes a [comma below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_below "Comma below") the letters _s_ (⟨[ș](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%98 "Ș")⟩) and _t_ (⟨[ț](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%9A "Ț")⟩) to represent the sounds /ʃ/ and /t͡s/, respectively. These characters are collated after their non-diacritic equivalent.
*   [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language") uses acute accents (⟨á⟩, ⟨é⟩, ⟨í⟩, ⟨ó⟩, ⟨ú⟩) to indicate stress falling on a different syllable than the one it would fall on based on default rules, and to distinguish certain one-syllable homonyms (e.g. _el_ (masculine singular definite article) and _él_ [he]). The acute accent is also used to break up sequences of vowels that would normally be pronouced as a diphthong into two syllables, as in the word _reír_. Diaeresis is used on u only, to distinguish the combinations _gue, gui_/ge/,/gi/ from _güe, güi_/gwe/,/gwi/, e.g. _vergüenza, lingüística_. The tilde on ⟨ñ⟩ is not considered a diacritic as ⟨ñ⟩ is considered a distinct letter from ⟨n⟩, not a mutated form of it.

*   [Gaj's Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaj%27s_Latin_alphabet "Gaj's Latin alphabet"), used in [Croatian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_language "Croatian language") and latinized [Serbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_language "Serbian language"), has the symbols ⟨[č](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8C "Č")⟩, ⟨[ć](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%86 "Ć")⟩, ⟨[đ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90 "Đ")⟩, ⟨[š](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0 "Š")⟩ and ⟨[ž](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BD "Ž")⟩, which are considered separate letters and are listed as such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. It also has one [digraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(orthography) "Digraph (orthography)") including a diacritic, _[dž](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%BE "Dž")_, which is also alphabetized independently, and follows ⟨[d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D "D")⟩ and precedes ⟨[đ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90 "Đ")⟩ in the alphabetical order.
*   The [Czech alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_alphabet "Czech alphabet") uses the acute (lowercase [á](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81 "Á")[é](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89 "É")[í](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8D "Í")[ó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93 "Ó")[ú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9A "Ú")[ý](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9D "Ý"), uppercase [Á](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81 "Á")[É](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89 "É")[Í](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8D "Í")[Ó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93 "Ó")[Ú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9A "Ú")[Ý](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9D "Ý")), caron (lowercase [č](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8C "Č")[ď](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8E "Ď")[ě](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9A "Ě")[ň](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%87 "Ň")[ř](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%98 "Ř")[š](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0 "Š")[ť](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A4 "Ť")[ž](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BD "Ž"), uppercase [Č](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8C "Č")[Ď](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8E "Ď")[Ě](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9A "Ě")[Ň](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%87 "Ň")[Ř](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%98 "Ř")[Š](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0 "Š")[Ť](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A4 "Ť")[Ž](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BD "Ž")), and for one letter (lowercase [ů](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%AE "Ů"), uppercase [Ů](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%AE "Ů")) the ring. (In ď and ť the caron is modified to look rather like an apostrophe.) Letter with caron are considered separate letters, whereas vowels are considered only as longer variants of the unaccented letters. Acute does not affect alphabetical order, letters with caron are ordered after original counterparts.
*   [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_alphabet "Polish alphabet") has the following letters: [ą](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%84 "Ą")[ć](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%86 "Ć")[ę](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%98 "Ę")[ł](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81 "Ł")[ń](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%83 "Ń")[ó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93 "Ó")[ś](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A "Ś")[ź](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%B9 "Ź")[ż](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BB "Ż"). These are considered to be separate letters: each of them is placed in the alphabet immediately after its Latin counterpart (e.g. ⟨ą⟩ between ⟨a⟩ and ⟨b⟩), ⟨ź⟩ and ⟨ż⟩ are placed after ⟨z⟩ in that order.
*   The [Serbian Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Cyrillic_alphabet "Serbian Cyrillic alphabet") alphabet has no diacritics, instead it has a grapheme ([glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph")) for every letter of [its Latin counterpart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaj%27s_Latin_alphabet "Gaj's Latin alphabet") (including Latin letters with diacritics and the digraphs dž, _[lj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lje "Lje")_ and _[nj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nj\_(digraph) "Nj (digraph)")_).
*   The [Slovak alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_alphabet "Slovak alphabet") uses the acute (lowercase [á](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81 "Á")[é](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89 "É")[í](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8D "Í")[ó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93 "Ó")[ú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9A "Ú")[ý](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9D "Ý")[ĺ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B9 "Ĺ")[ŕ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%94 "Ŕ"), uppercase [Á](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81 "Á")[É](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89 "É")[Í](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8D "Í")[Ó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93 "Ó")[Ú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9A "Ú")[Ý](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9D "Ý")[Ĺ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B9 "Ĺ")[Ŕ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%94 "Ŕ")), caron (lowercase [č](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8C "Č")[ď](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8E "Ď")[ľ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%BD "Ľ")[ň](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%87 "Ň")[š](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0 "Š")[ť](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A4 "Ť")[ž](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BD "Ž")[dž](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%BE "Dž"), uppercase [Č](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8C "Č")[Ď](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8E "Ď")[Ľ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%BD "Ľ")[Ň](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%87 "Ň")[Š](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0 "Š")[Ť](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A4 "Ť")[Ž](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BD "Ž")[DŽ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%BD "DŽ")), umlaut ([ä](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84 "Ä")[Ä](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84 "Ä")) and circumflex accent ([ô](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%94 "Ô")[Ô](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%94 "Ô")). All of those are considered separate letters and are placed directly after the original counterpart in the [alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_alphabet "Slovak alphabet").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-PSP2000-9)
*   The basic [Slovenian alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenian_alphabet "Slovenian alphabet") has the symbols ⟨[č](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8C "Č")⟩, ⟨[š](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0 "Š")⟩, and ⟨[ž](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BD "Ž")⟩, which are considered separate letters and are listed as such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. Letters with a [caron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caron "Caron") are placed right after the letters as written without the diacritic. The letter ⟨đ⟩ ('d with bar') may be used in non-transliterated foreign words, particularly names, and is placed after ⟨č⟩ and before ⟨d⟩.

*   [Azerbaijani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_alphabet "Azerbaijani alphabet") includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters [Ç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87 "Ç"), [Ğ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9E "Ğ"), [I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotless_I "Dotless I"), [İ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0 "İ"), [Ö](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96 "Ö"), [Ş](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9E "Ş") and [Ü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9C "Ü").
*   [Crimean Tatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Tatar_language "Crimean Tatar language") includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters [Ç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87 "Ç"), [Ğ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9E "Ğ"), [I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotless_I "Dotless I"), [İ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0 "İ"), [Ö](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96 "Ö"), [Ş](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9E "Ş") and [Ü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9C "Ü"). Unlike Turkish, Crimean Tatar also has the letter [Ñ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%91 "Ñ").
*   [Gagauz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gagauz_alphabet "Gagauz alphabet") includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters [Ç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87 "Ç"), [Ğ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9E "Ğ"), [I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotless_I "Dotless I"), [İ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0 "İ"), [Ö](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96 "Ö") and [Ü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9C "Ü"). Unlike Turkish, Gagauz also has the letters [Ä](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84 "Ä"), [Ê](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8A "Ê")[Ș](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%98 "Ș") and [Ț](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%9A "Ț"). [Ș](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%98 "Ș") and [Ț](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%9A "Ț") are derived from the [Romanian alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_alphabet "Romanian alphabet") for the same sounds. Sometime the Turkish [Ş](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9E "Ş") may be used instead of [Ș](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%98 "Ș").
*   [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_alphabet "Turkish alphabet") uses a ⟨G⟩ with a breve (⟨[Ğ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9E "Ğ")⟩), two letters with [two dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_dots_(diacritic) "Two dots (diacritic)") (⟨[Ö](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96 "Ö")⟩ and ⟨[Ü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9C "Ü")⟩, representing two rounded front vowels), two letters with a cedilla (⟨[Ç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87 "Ç")⟩ and ⟨[Ş](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-cedilla "S-cedilla")⟩, representing the affricate /tʃ/ and the fricative /ʃ/), and also possesses a dotted capital ⟨İ⟩ (and a [dotless lowercase ⟨ı⟩](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotless_i "Dotless i") representing a high unrounded back vowel). In Turkish each of these are separate letters, rather than versions of other letters, where dotted capital ⟨İ⟩ and lower case ⟨i⟩ are the same letter, as are dotless capital ⟨I⟩ and lowercase ⟨ı⟩. [Typographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface "Typeface"), ⟨Ç⟩ and ⟨Ş⟩ are sometimes rendered with an [underdot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdot "Underdot"), as in ⟨Ṣ⟩. The new Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar, and Gagauz alphabets are based on the Turkish alphabet and its same diacriticized letters, with some additions.
*   [Turkmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmen_alphabet "Turkmen alphabet") includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters [Ç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87 "Ç"), [Ö](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96 "Ö"), [Ş](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9E "Ş") and [Ü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9C "Ü"). In addition, Turkmen uses A with diaeresis (_[Ä](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84 "Ä")_) to represent /æ/, N with caron (⟨[Ň](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%87 "Ň")⟩) to represent the [velar nasal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velar_nasal "Velar nasal")/ŋ/, Y with acute (⟨[Ý](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9D "Ý")⟩) to represent the [palatal approximant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_approximant "Palatal approximant")/j/, and Z with caron (⟨[Ž](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BD "Ž")⟩) to represent /ʒ/.

*   [Albanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_alphabet "Albanian alphabet") has two special letters [Ç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87 "Ç") and [Ë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8B "Ë") upper and lowercase. They are placed next to the most similar letters in the alphabet, c and e correspondingly.
*   [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_alphabet "Esperanto alphabet") has the symbols _[ŭ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%AC "Ŭ")_, _[ĉ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%88 "Ĉ"), [ĝ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9C "Ĝ"), [ĥ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A4 "Ĥ"), [ĵ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B4 "Ĵ")_ and _[ŝ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9C "Ŝ")_, which are included in the alphabet, and considered separate letters.
*   [Filipino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_alphabet "Filipino alphabet") also has the character _[ñ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%91 "Ñ")_ as a letter and is collated between n and o.
*   Modern [Greenlandic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenlandic_orthography "Greenlandic orthography") does not use any diacritics, although _ø_ and _å_ are used to spell loanwords, especially from Danish and English.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-10)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-11) From 1851 until 1973, Greenlandic was written in an alphabet invented by [Samuel Kleinschmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Kleinschmidt "Samuel Kleinschmidt"), where [long vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_vowels "Long vowels") and [geminate consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminate_consonant "Geminate consonant") were indicated by diacritics on vowels (in the case of consonant gemination, the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant). For example, the name _[Kalaallit Nunaat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalaallit\_Nunaat "Kalaallit Nunaat")_ was spelled _Kalâdlit Nunât_. This scheme uses the [circumflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex "Circumflex") (◌̂) to indicate a long vowel (e.g. ⟨ât, ît, ût⟩; modern: ⟨aat, iit, uut⟩), an [acute accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent "Acute accent") (◌́) to indicate gemination of the following consonant: (i.e. ⟨ák, ík, úk⟩; modern: ⟨akk, ikk, ukk⟩) and, finally, a [tilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde "Tilde") (◌̃) or a [grave accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent "Grave accent") (◌̀), depending on the author, indicates vowel length and gemination of the following consonant (e.g. ⟨ãt/àt, ĩt/ìt, ũt/ùt⟩; modern: ⟨aatt, iitt, uutt⟩). ⟨ê, ô⟩, used only before ⟨r, q⟩, are now written ⟨ee, oo⟩ in Greenlandic.
*   [Hawaiian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_alphabet "Hawaiian alphabet") uses the kahakō ([macron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron_(diacritic) "Macron (diacritic)")) over vowels, although there is some disagreement over considering them as individual letters. The kahakō over a vowel can completely change the meaning of a word that is spelled the same but without the kahakō.
*   [Kurdish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_alphabet "Kurdish alphabet") uses the symbols [Ç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87 "Ç"), [Ê](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8A "Ê"), [Î](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8E "Î"), [Ş](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9E "Ş") and [Û](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9B "Û") with other 26 standard Latin alphabet symbols.
*   [Lakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_language "Lakota language") alphabet uses the [caron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caron "Caron") for the letters _č_, _ȟ_, _ǧ_, _š_, and _ž_. It also uses the [acute accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent "Acute accent") for stressed vowels á, é, í, ó, ú, áŋ, íŋ, úŋ.
*   [Malay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language") uses some diacritics such as _á, ā, ç, í, ñ, ó, š, ú_. Uses of diacritics was continued until late 19th century except _ā_ and _ē_.
*   [Maltese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_alphabet "Maltese alphabet") uses a C, G, and Z with a dot over them (Ċ, Ġ, Ż), and also has an H with an extra horizontal bar. For uppercase H, the extra bar is written slightly above the usual bar. For lowercase H, the extra bar is written crossing the vertical, like a _t_, and not touching the lower part ([Ħ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A6 "Ħ"), ħ). The above characters are considered separate letters. The letter 'c' without a dot has fallen out of use due to redundancy. 'Ċ' is pronounced like the English 'ch' and 'k' is used as a hard c as in 'cat'. 'Ż' is pronounced just like the English 'Z' as in 'Zebra', while 'Z' is used to make the sound of 'ts' in English (like 'tsunami' or 'maths'). 'Ġ' is used as a soft 'G' like in 'geometry', while the 'G' sounds like a hard 'G' like in 'log'. The digraph 'għ' (called _għajn_ after the [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet "Arabic alphabet") letter name _ʻayn_ for غ) is considered separate, and sometimes ordered after 'g', whilst in other volumes it is placed between 'n' and 'o' (the Latin letter 'o' originally evolved from the shape of [Phoenician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet "Phoenician alphabet")_ʻayin_, which was traditionally collated after Phoenician _nūn_).
*   The [romanization of Syriac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Syriac "Romanization of Syriac") uses the altered letters of. _[Ā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80 "Ā"), [Č](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8C "Č"), [Ḏ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%B8%8E "Ḏ"), [Ē](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%92 "Ē"), [Ë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8B "Ë"), [Ġ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A0 "Ġ"), [Ḥ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%B8%A4 "Ḥ"), [Ō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8C "Ō"), [Š](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0 "Š"), [Ṣ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%B9%A2 "Ṣ"), [Ṭ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%B9%AC "Ṭ"), [Ū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%AA "Ū"), [Ž](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BD "Ž")_ alongside the 26 standard Latin alphabet symbols.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-12)
*   [Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_alphabet "Vietnamese alphabet") uses the [horn diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_(diacritic) "Horn (diacritic)") for the letters _ơ_ and _ư_; the [circumflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex "Circumflex") for the letters _â_, _ê_, and _ô_; the [breve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breve "Breve") for the letter _ă_; and a bar through the letter _đ_. Separately, it also has á, à, ả, ã and ạ, the five tones used for vowels besides the flat tone 'a'.

*   [Belarusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusian_alphabet "Belarusian alphabet") and [Uzbek Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbek_alphabet#Correspondence_chart "Uzbek alphabet") have a letter ⟨[ў](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_U_(Cyrillic) "Short U (Cyrillic)")⟩.
*   Belarusian, [Bulgarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language#Alphabet "Bulgarian language"), Russian and Ukrainian have the letter ⟨[й](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_I "Short I")⟩.
*   Belarusian and [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_alphabet "Russian alphabet") have the letter ⟨[ё](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_(Cyrillic) "Yo (Cyrillic)")⟩. In Russian, this letter is usually replaced by ⟨[е](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_(Cyrillic) "Ye (Cyrillic)")⟩, although it has a different pronunciation. The use of ⟨е⟩ instead of ⟨ё⟩ does not affect the pronunciation. _Ё_ is always used in children's books and in dictionaries. A [minimal pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_pair "Minimal pair") is все (_vs'e_, "everybody" pl.) and всё (_vs'o_, "everything" n. sg.). In Belarusian the replacement by ⟨е⟩ is a mistake; in Russian, it is permissible to use either ⟨е⟩ or ⟨ё⟩ for ⟨ё⟩ but the former is more common in everyday writing (as opposed to instructional or juvenile writing).
*   The Cyrillic [Ukrainian alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_alphabet "Ukrainian alphabet") has the letters ⟨[ґ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D2%90 "Ґ")⟩, ⟨[й](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%99 "Й")⟩ and ⟨[ї](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%87 "Ї")⟩. Ukrainian [Latynka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latynka "Latynka") has many more.
*   [Macedonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_language "Macedonian language") has the letters ⟨[ќ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kje "Kje")⟩ and ⟨[ѓ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gje "Gje")⟩.
*   In Bulgarian and [Macedonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_language "Macedonian language") the possessive pronoun ѝ (_ì_, "her") is spelled with a grave accent in order to distinguish it from the conjunction и (_i_, "and").
*   The acute accent ◌́ above any vowel in Cyrillic alphabets is used in dictionaries, books for children and foreign learners to indicate the word stress, it also can be used for disambiguation of similarly spelled words with different lexical stresses.

Diacritics that do not produce new letters

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diacritic&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Diacritics that do not produce new letters")]

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Spanish_orthography.jpg/500px-Spanish_orthography.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spanish_orthography.jpg)

Blackboard used in class at [Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") shows students' efforts at placing the [ü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9C "Ü") and [acute accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent "Acute accent") diacritic used in [Spanish orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_orthography "Spanish orthography").

[English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet "English alphabet") is one of the few European languages that does not have many words that contain diacritical marks. Instead, digraphs are the main way the Modern English alphabet adapts the Latin to its phonemes. Exceptions are unassimilated foreign loanwords, including borrowings from [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") (and, increasingly, [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language"), like _jalapeño_ and _piñata_); however, the diacritic is also sometimes omitted from such words. Loanwords that frequently appear with the diacritic in English include _café_, _résumé_ or _resumé_ (a usage that helps distinguish it from the verb _resume_), _soufflé_, and _naïveté_ (see _[English terms with diacritical marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English\_terms\_with\_diacritical\_marks "English terms with diacritical marks")_). In older practice (and even among some orthographically conservative modern writers), one may see examples such as _élite_, _mêlée_ and _rôle._

English speakers and writers once used the diaeresis more often than now in words such as _coöperation_ (from Fr. _coopération_), _zoölogy_ (from Grk. _zoologia_), and _seeër_ (now more commonly _see-er_ or simply _seer_) as a way of indicating that adjacent vowels belonged to separate syllables, but this practice has become far less common. _[The New Yorker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_Yorker "The New Yorker")_ magazine is a major publication that continues to use the diaeresis in place of a hyphen for clarity and economy of space.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-13)

A few English words, often when used out of context, especially in isolation, can only be distinguished from other words of the same spelling by using a diacritic or modified letter. These include _exposé_, _lamé_, _maté_, _öre_, _øre_, _résumé_ and _rosé._ In a few words, diacritics that did not exist in the original have been added for disambiguation, as in _maté_ (_from Sp. and Port._ mate)_, saké_ (_the standard Romanization of the Japanese has no accent mark_)_, and_[Malé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9 "Malé") (_from Dhivehi މާލެ_)_,_ to clearly distinguish them from the English words _mate, sake,_ and _male._

The acute and grave accents are occasionally used in poetry and lyrics: the acute to indicate stress overtly where it might be ambiguous (_rébel_ vs. _rebél_) or nonstandard for metrical reasons (_caléndar_), the grave to indicate that an ordinarily silent or elided syllable is pronounced (_warnèd,_ _parlìament_).

In certain personal names such as _[Renée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e "Renée")_ and _[Zoë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe\_(name) "Zoe (name)")_, often two spellings exist, and the person's own preference will be known only to those close to them. Even when the name of a person is spelled with a diacritic, like _[Charlotte Brontë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte\_Bront%C3%AB "Charlotte Brontë")_, this may be dropped in English-language articles, and even in official documents such as [passports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport "Passport"), due either to carelessness, the typist not knowing how to enter letters with diacritical marks, or technical reasons ([California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California"), for example, does not allow[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] names with diacritics, as the computer system cannot process such characters). They also appear in some worldwide company names and/or trademarks, such as _[Nestlé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9 "Nestlé")_ and _[Citroën](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn "Citroën")_.

The following languages have letter-diacritic combinations that are not considered independent letters.

*   [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans "Afrikaans") uses a diaeresis to mark vowels that are pronounced separately and not as one would expect where they occur together, for example _voel_ (to feel) as opposed to _voël_ (bird). The circumflex is used in _ê, î, ô_ and _û_ generally to indicate long [close-mid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_vowel "Close-mid vowel"), as opposed to [open-mid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_vowel "Open-mid vowel") vowels, for example in the words _wêreld_ (world) and _môre_ (morning, tomorrow). The acute accent is used to add emphasis in the same way as underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example _Dit is jóú boek_ (It is **your** book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example _appel_ (apple) and _appèl_ (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes no difference to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are in the sayings _òf... òf_ (either... or) and _nòg... nòg_ (neither... nor) to distinguish them from _of_ (or) and _nog_ (again, still).
*   [Aymara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_language "Aymara language") uses a diacritical horn over _p, q, t, k, ch_.
*   [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_alphabet "Catalan alphabet") has the following composite characters: _à, ç, é, è, í, ï, ó, ò, ú, ü, l·l_. The acute and the grave indicate [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics) "Stress (linguistics)") and [vowel height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_height "Vowel height"), the cedilla marks the result of a historical [palatalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization_(sound_change) "Palatalization (sound change)"), the diaeresis indicates either a [hiatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_(linguistics) "Hiatus (linguistics)"), or that the letter _u_ is pronounced when the graphemes _gü, qü_ are followed by _e_ or _i_, the [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct") (·) distinguishes the different values of _\_ll/l·l\__.
*   Some orthographies of [Cornish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_language "Cornish language") such as [Kernowek Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernowek_Standard "Kernowek Standard") and [Unified Cornish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Cornish "Unified Cornish") use diacritics, while others such as [Kernewek Kemmyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernewek_Kemmyn "Kernewek Kemmyn") and the [Standard Written Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Written_Form "Standard Written Form") do not (or only use them optionally in teaching materials).
*   [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_alphabet "Dutch alphabet") uses the diaeresis. For example, in _ruïne_ it means that the _u_ and the _i_ are separately pronounced in their usual way, and not in the way that the combination _ui_ is normally pronounced. Thus it works as a separation sign and not as an indication for an alternative version of the _i_. Diacritics can be used for emphasis (_érg koud_ for _very_ cold) or for disambiguation between a number of words that are spelled the same when context does not indicate the correct meaning (_één appel_ = one apple, _een appel_ = an apple; _vóórkomen_ = to occur, _voorkómen_ = to prevent). Grave and acute accents are used on a very small number of words, mostly loanwords. The ç also appears in some loanwords.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-14)
*   [Faroese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroese_alphabet "Faroese alphabet"). Non-Faroese accented letters are not added to the Faroese alphabet. These include _é_, _ö_, _ü_, _å_ and recently also letters like _š_, _ł_, and _ć_.
*   [Filipino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_alphabet "Filipino alphabet") has the following composite characters: _á, à, â, é, è, ê, í, ì, î, ó, ò, ô, ú, ù, û_. Everyday use of diacritics for Filipino is, however, uncommon, and meant only to distinguish between [homonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym "Homonym") between a word with the usual [penultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penult "Penult") stress and one with a different stress placement. This aids both comprehension and pronunciation if both are relatively adjacent in a text, or if a word is itself ambiguous in meaning. The letter _ñ_ ("_eñe_") is not a _n_ with a diacritic, but rather collated as a separate letter, one of eight borrowed from Spanish. Diacritics appear in [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language_in_the_Philippines "Spanish language in the Philippines")[loanwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Spanish "List of loanwords in Tagalog") and [names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_name "Filipino name") observing Spanish orthography rules.
*   [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_alphabet "Finnish alphabet"). Carons in _š_ and _ž_ appear only in foreign proper names and [loanwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword "Loanword"), but may be substituted with _sh_ or _zh_ if and only if it is technically impossible to produce accented letters in the medium. Contrary to Estonian, _š_ and _ž_ are not considered distinct letters in Finnish.
*   [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_alphabet "French alphabet") uses five diacritics. The grave (_accent grave_) marks the sound /ɛ/ when over an e, as in _père_ ("father") or is used to distinguish words that are otherwise homographs such as _a_/_à_ ("has"/"to") or _ou_/_où_ ("or"/"where"). The [acute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent "Acute accent") (_accent aigu_) is only used in "é", modifying the "e" to make the sound /e/, as in _étoile_ ("star"). The [circumflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex "Circumflex") (_accent circonflexe_) generally denotes that an "s" once followed the vowel in Old French or Latin, as in _fête_ ("party"), the Old French being _feste_ and the Latin being _festum_. Whether the circumflex modifies the vowel's pronunciation depends on the dialect and the vowel. The [cedilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedilla "Cedilla") (_cédille_) indicates that a normally hard "c" (before the vowels "a", "o", and "u") is to be pronounced /s/, as in _ça_ ("that"). The diaeresis diacritic ([French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"): _tréma_) indicates that two adjacent vowels that would normally be pronounced as one are to be pronounced separately, as in _Noël_ ("Christmas").
*   [Galician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language "Galician language") vowels can bear an acute (_á, é, í, ó, ú_) to indicate stress or difference between two otherwise same written words (_é_, 'is' vs. _e_, 'and'), but the diaeresis is only used with _ï_ and _ü_ to show two separate vowel sounds in pronunciation. Only in foreign words may Galician use other diacritics such as _ç_ (common during the Middle Ages), _ê_, or _à_.
*   [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_alphabet "German alphabet") uses the three umlauted characters _ä_, _ö_ and _ü_. These diacritics indicate vowel changes. For instance, the word _Ofen_[[ˈoːfən]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German "Help:IPA/Standard German") "oven" has the plural _Öfen_[ˈøːfən]. The mark originated as a superscript _e_; a handwritten blackletter _e_ resembles two parallel vertical lines, like a diaeresis. Due to this history, "ä", "ö" and "ü" can be written as "ae", "oe" and "ue" respectively, if the umlaut letters are not available.
*   [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet "Hebrew alphabet") has many various diacritic marks known as _[niqqud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud "Niqqud")_ that are used above and below script to represent vowels. These must be distinguished from [cantillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_cantillation "Hebrew cantillation"), which are keys to pronunciation and syntax.
*   The [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet "International Phonetic Alphabet") uses diacritic symbols and characters to indicate phonetic features or secondary articulations.
*   [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_alphabet "Irish alphabet") uses the acute to indicate that a vowel is [long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length "Vowel length"): _á_, _é_, _í_, _ó_, _ú_. It is known as _síneadh fada_ "long sign" or simply _fada_ "long" in Irish. In the older [Gaelic type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_type "Gaelic type"), [overdots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdot "Overdot") are used to indicate [lenition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition "Lenition") of a consonant: _ḃ_, _ċ_, _ḋ_, _ḟ_, _ġ_, _ṁ_, _ṗ_, _ṡ_, _ṫ_.
*   [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_alphabet "Italian alphabet") mainly has the [acute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent "Acute accent") and the [grave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent "Grave accent") (_à_, _è_/_é_, _ì_, _ò_/_ó_, _ù_), typically to indicate a stressed syllable that would not be stressed under the normal rules of pronunciation but sometimes also to distinguish between words that are otherwise spelled the same way (e.g. "e", and; "è", is). Despite its rare use, Italian orthography allows the circumflex (î) too, in two cases: it can be found in old literary context (roughly up to 19th century) to signal a [syncope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(phonetics) "Syncope (phonetics)") (fêro→fecero, they did), or in modern Italian to signal the contraction of ″-ii″ due to the plural ending -i whereas the root ends with another -i; e.g., [s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number "Grammatical number") demonio, [p.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural "Plural") demonii→demonî; in this case the circumflex also signals that the word intended is not demoni, plural of "demone" by shifting the accent (demònî, "devils"; dèmoni, "demons").
*   [Lithuanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_alphabet "Lithuanian alphabet") uses the [acute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent "Acute accent"), [grave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent "Grave accent") and [tilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde "Tilde") in dictionaries to indicate stress types in the language's [pitch accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_accent "Pitch accent") system.
*   [Maltese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_alphabet "Maltese alphabet") also uses the grave on its vowels to indicate stress at the end of a word with two syllables or more:– lowercase letters: à, è, ì, ò, ù; capital letters: À, È, Ì, Ò, Ù
*   [Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language "Māori language") makes use of macrons to mark long vowels.
*   [Occitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_alphabet "Occitan alphabet") has the following composite characters: _á, à, ç, é, è, í, ï, ó, ò, ú, ü, n·h, s·h_. The acute and the grave indicate [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics) "Stress (linguistics)") and [vowel height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_height "Vowel height"), the cedilla marks the result of a historical [palatalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization_(sound_change) "Palatalization (sound change)"), the diaeresis indicates either a [hiatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_(linguistics) "Hiatus (linguistics)"), or that the letter _u_ is pronounced when the graphemes _gü, qü_ are followed by _e_ or _i_, and the [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct") (·) distinguishes the different values of _nh/n·h_ and _sh/s·h_ (i.e., that the letters are supposed to be pronounced separately, not combined into "ny" and "sh").
*   [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_alphabet "Portuguese alphabet") has the following composite characters: _à, á, â, ã, ç, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú_. The acute and the circumflex indicate stress and vowel height, the grave indicates crasis, the tilde represents nasalization, and the cedilla marks the result of a historical lenition.
*   Acutes are also used in [Slavic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_language "Slavic language") dictionaries and textbooks to indicate [lexical stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_stress "Lexical stress"), placed over the vowel of the stressed syllable. This can also serve to disambiguate meaning (e.g., in Russian писа́ть (_pisáť_) means "to write", but пи́сать (_písať_) means "to piss"), or "бо́льшая часть" (the biggest part) vs "больша́я часть" (the big part).
*   [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_alphabet "Spanish alphabet") uses the acute and the diaeresis. The acute is used on a vowel in a stressed syllable in words with irregular stress patterns. It can also be used to "break up" a [diphthong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong "Diphthong") as in _tío_ (pronounced [ˈti.o], rather than [ˈtjo] as it would be without the accent). Moreover, the acute can be used to distinguish words that otherwise are spelled alike, such as _si_ ("if") and _sí_ ("yes"), and also to distinguish interrogative and exclamatory pronouns from homophones with a different grammatical function, such as _donde/¿dónde?_ ("where"/"where?") or _como/¿cómo?_ ("as"/"how?"). The acute may also be used to avoid typographical ambiguity, as in _1 ó 2_ ("1 or 2"; without the acute this might be interpreted as "1 0 2". The diaeresis is used only over _u_ (_ü_) for it to be pronounced [w] in the combinations _gue_ and _gui,_ where _u_ is normally silent, for example _ambigüedad._ In poetry, the diaeresis may be used on _i_ and _u_ as a way to force a hiatus. As foreshadowed above, in nasal _ñ_ the [tilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde "Tilde") (squiggle) is not considered a diacritic sign at all, but a composite part of a distinct glyph, with its own chapter in the dictionary: a glyph that denotes the 15th letter of the Spanish alphabet.
*   [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_alphabet "Swedish alphabet") uses the [acute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent "Acute accent") to show non-standard stress, for example in _kafé_ (café) and _resumé_ (résumé). This occasionally helps resolve ambiguities, such as _ide_ (hibernation) versus _idé_ (idea). In these words, the acute is not optional. Some proper names use non-standard diacritics, such as [Carolina Klüft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Kl%C3%BCft "Carolina Klüft") and [Staël von Holstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sta%C3%ABl_von_Holstein "Staël von Holstein"). For foreign loanwords the original accents are strongly recommended, unless the word has been infused into the language, in which case they are optional. Hence _crème fraîche_ but _ampere_. Swedish also has the letters _å_, _ä_, and _ö_, but these are considered distinct letters, not _a_ and _o_ with diacritics.
*   [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_alphabet "Tamil alphabet") does not have any diacritics in itself, but uses the [Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals "Arabic numerals") 2, 3 and 4 as diacritics to represent aspirated, voiced, and voiced-aspirated consonants when Tamil script is used to write long passages in [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit").
*   [Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_alphabet "Thai alphabet") has its [own system of diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_script#Diacritics "Thai script") derived from [Indian numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_numerals "Indian numerals"), which denote different [tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics) "Tone (linguistics)").
*   [Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_alphabet "Vietnamese alphabet") uses the acute (_dấu sắc_), the grave (_dấu huyền_), the tilde (_dấu ngã_), the underdot (_dấu nặng_) and the hook above (_dấu hỏi_) on vowels as [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics) "Tone (linguistics)") indicators.
*   [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_alphabet "Welsh alphabet") uses the circumflex, diaeresis, acute, and grave on its seven vowels _a, e, i, o, u, w, y_. The most common is the circumflex (which it calls _to bach_, meaning "little roof", or _acen grom_ "crooked accent", or _hirnod_ "long sign") to denote a long vowel, usually to disambiguate it from a similar word with a short vowel or a semivowel. The rarer grave accent has the opposite effect, shortening vowel sounds that would usually be pronounced long. The acute accent and diaeresis are also occasionally used, to denote stress and vowel separation respectively. The _w_-circumflex ŵ and the _y_-circumflex ŷ are among the most commonly accented characters in Welsh, but unusual in languages generally, and were until recently very hard to obtain in word-processed and HTML documents.

Several languages that are not written with the Roman alphabet are [transliterated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration "Transliteration"), or romanized, using diacritics. Examples:

*   [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") has several [romanisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_romanization#Comparison_table "Arabic romanization"), depending on the type of the application, region, intended audience, country, etc. many of them extensively use diacritics, e.g., some methods use an underdot for rendering [emphatic consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphatic_consonant "Emphatic consonant") (ṣ, ṭ, ḍ, ẓ, ḥ). The macron is often used to render long vowels. š is often used for /ʃ/, ġ for /ɣ/.
*   [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language") has several [romanizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese "Romanization of Chinese") that use the umlaut, but only on _u_ (_ü_). In [Hanyu Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Usage "Pinyin"), the four [tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics) "Tone (linguistics)") of [Mandarin Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese "Standard Chinese") are denoted by the macron (first tone), acute (second tone), caron (third tone) and grave (fourth tone) diacritics. Example: _ā, á, ǎ, à_.
*   Romanized [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language") ([Rōmaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C5%8Dmaji "Rōmaji")) occasionally uses macrons to mark long vowels. The [Hepburn romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization "Hepburn romanization") system uses [macrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron_(diacritic) "Macron (diacritic)") to mark [long vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_vowels "Long vowels"), and the [Kunrei-shiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunrei-shiki_romanization "Kunrei-shiki romanization") and [Nihon-shiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon-shiki "Nihon-shiki") systems use a [circumflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex "Circumflex").
*   [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit"), as well as many of its descendants, like [Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi "Hindi") and [Bengali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language "Bengali language"), uses a lossless [romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration "Transliteration") system, [IAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration "International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration"). This includes several letters with diacritical markings, such as the macron (ā, ī, ū), over- and underdots (ṛ, ḥ, ṃ, ṇ, ṣ, ṭ, ḍ) as well as a few others (ś, ñ).

Possibly the greatest number of combining diacritics _required_ to compose a valid character in any Unicode language is 8, for the "well-known grapheme cluster in Tibetan and Ranjana scripts" or _HAKṢHMALAWARAYAṀ_.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic#cite_note-15)

Archived from [the original](http://dscriber.com/news/121-the-new-yorkers-odd-mark-the-diaeresis) on 16 December 2010. Among the many mysteries of The New Yorker is that funny little umlaut over words like coöperate and reëlect. The New Yorker seems to be the only publication on the planet that uses it, and I always found it a little pretentious until I did some research. Turns out, it's not an umlaut. It's a diaeresis.

Even letters with accents and diacritics [...] being only cast for a few founts, act practically as new letters. [...] We may consider the h in sh and th simply as a diacritic written for convenience on a line with the letter it modifies.
