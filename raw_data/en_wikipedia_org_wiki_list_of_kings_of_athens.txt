Most of these are probably mythical or only semi-historical. The following lists contain the chronological order of the title King of Athens (also prescribed earlier as kings of Attica), a semi-mythological title.

Earliest kings [ edit ] These three kings were supposed to have ruled before the flood of Deucalion .

King Comments Periphas Turned into an eagle by Zeus Ogyges [ 1 ] [ 2 ] King of the Ectenes [ 3 ] who were the earliest inhabitants of Boeotia Actaeus Father of Agraulus , and father-in-law to Cecrops Other sources mentioned two other ancient rulers of Athens: Porphyrion - an earlier Athenian king than Actaeus. He was the reputed founder of the sanctuary of Heavenly Aphrodite on Athmoneis , an Athenian deme.

[ 4 ] Colaenus - Hellanicus, the Mitylenian historian , tells that this surname of Artemis is derived from Colænus, King of Athens before Cecrops and a descendant of Hermes. In obedience to an oracle he erected a temple to the goddess, invoking her as Artemis Colænis (the Artemis of Colænus).

Erechtheid dynasty [ edit ] The early Athenian tradition, followed by the 3rd century BC Parian Chronicle , made Cecrops, a mythical half-man half-serpent, the first king of Athens.

[ 5 ] The dates for the following kings were conjectured centuries later, by historians of the Hellenistic era who tried to backdate events by cross-referencing earlier sources such as the Parian Chronicle. Tradition says that King Menestheus took part in the Trojan War .

The following list follows that of 1st Century BC Castor of Rhodes ( FGrHist 250), with Castor's dates given in modern terms.

[ 6 ] Reign King Comments 1556–1506 BC Cecrops I Born from the Earth , he married Actaeus' daughter Agraulus and succeeded him to the throne 1506–1497 BC Cranaus Earth-born, deposed by Amphictyon son of Deucalion 1497–1487 BC Amphictyon Either son of Deucalion or Earth-born, he deposed Cranaus and was in turn deposed by Erichthonius 1487–1437 BC Erichthonius Earth-born son of Hephaestus and either Gaia, Athena or Atthis 1437–1397 BC Pandion I Son of Erichthonius 1397–1347 BC Erechtheus Son of Pandion I 1347–1307 BC Cecrops II Son of Erechtheus; omitted in Heraclides' epitome of Aristotle 's Constitution of the Athenians [ 7 ] 1307–1282 BC Pandion II Son of Cecrops II 1282–1234 BC Aegeus Son of Pandion II; construction of Trojan Walls by Poseidon , Apollo and the mortal Aeacus (c. 1282 BC) 1234–1205 BC Theseus Son of Aegeus 1205–1183 BC Menestheus Trojan War and the Sack of Troy [ 8 ] (c. 1183 BC) [ 9 ] 1183–1150 BC Demophon Son of Theseus 1150–1136 BC Oxyntes Son of Demophon 1136–1135 BC Apheidas Son of Oxyntes 1135–1127 BC Thymoetes Son of Oxyntes and brother of Apheidas See also: Autochthon (ancient Greece) and Mythical chronology of Greece Mythological Royal House of Athens Melanthid dynasty [ edit ] Melanthus was the Neleides king of Pylos in Messenia . Being driven out by the Dorian and Heraclidae invasion , he came to Athens where Thymoetes resigned the crown to him. Codrus, the last king, repelled the Dorian invasion of Attica .

Reign King Comments 1126–1089 BC Melanthus 1089–1068 BC Codrus After Codrus's death, his sons Medon and Acastus either reigned as kings, or became hereditary archons .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] In 753 BC the hereditary archonship was replaced by a non-hereditary system (see Archons of Athens ).

See also: Neleides Notes [ edit ] ^ King of Agea, not Athens; The name of Ogyges is also connected with Attic mythology, for in Attica too an Ogygian flood is mentioned, and he is described as the father of the Attic hero Eleusis ( Pausanias , 1.38.7 ) ^ A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology: Oarses-Zygia.
