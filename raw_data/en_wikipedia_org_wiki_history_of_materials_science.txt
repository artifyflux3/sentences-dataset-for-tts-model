[Materials science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science "Materials science") has shaped the development of civilizations since the dawn of humankind. Better materials for tools and weapons has allowed people to spread and conquer, and advancements in material processing like steel and aluminum production continue to impact society today. Historians have regarded materials as such an important aspect of civilizations such that entire periods of time have defined by the predominant material used ([Stone Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age "Stone Age"), [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age "Bronze Age"), [Iron Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age "Iron Age")). For most of recorded history, control of materials had been through alchemy or empirical means at best. The study and development of chemistry and physics assisted the study of materials, and eventually the interdisciplinary study of materials science emerged from the fusion of these studies.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-Book-1) The **history of materials science** is the study of how different materials were used and developed through the history of Earth and how those materials affected the culture of the peoples of the Earth. The term "[Silicon Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Age "Silicon Age")" is sometimes used to refer to the modern period of history during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.

In many cases, different cultures leave their materials as the only records; which [anthropologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropologists "Anthropologists") can use to define the existence of such cultures. The progressive use of more sophisticated materials allows archeologists to characterize and distinguish between peoples. This is partially due to the major material of use in a culture and to its associated benefits and drawbacks. [Stone-Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone-Age "Stone-Age") cultures were limited by which rocks they could find locally and by which they could acquire by trading. The use of [flint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint "Flint") around 300,000 BCE is sometimes [_[when?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] considered the beginning of the use of [ceramics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic "Ceramic"). The use of polished [stone axes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_axe "Stone axe") marks a significant advance, because a much wider variety of rocks could serve as tools.

A late [Bronze Age sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age_sword "Bronze Age sword")- or dagger-blade.

The innovation of smelting and casting metals in the [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age "Bronze Age") started to change the way that cultures developed and interacted with each other. [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Starting around 5,500 BCE, early [smiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalsmith "Metalsmith") began to re-shape [native metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_metal "Native metal") of [copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper "Copper") and [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold"), without the use of fire and by using tools and weapons. The heating of copper and its shaping with hammers began around 5,000 BCE. [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Melting and casting started around 4,000 BCE. [Metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy "Metallurgy") had its dawn with the reduction of copper from its ore around 3,500 BCE. The first [alloy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy "Alloy"), [bronze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze "Bronze") came into use around 3,000 BCE. [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The use of materials began in the Stone Age. Typically, materials such as bone, fibers, feathers, shells, animal skin, and clay were used for weapons, tools, jewelry, and shelter. The earliest tools were in the [Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic "Paleolithic") age, called [Oldowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldowan "Oldowan"). These were tools created from chipped rocks that would be used for scavenging purpose.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] As history carried on into the [Mesolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic "Mesolithic") age, tools became more complex and symmetrical in design with sharper edges. Moving into the [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic "Neolithic") age, agriculture began to develop as new ways to form tools for farming were discovered. Nearing the end of the Stone Age, humans began using copper, gold, and silver as a material. Due to these metals' softness, the general use was for ceremonial purposes and to create ornaments or decorations and did not replace other materials for use in tools. The simplicity of the tools used reflected on the simple understanding of the human species of the time.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-2)

The use of copper had become very apparent to civilizations, such as its properties of elasticity and plasticity that allow it to be hammered into useful shapes, along with its ability to be melted and poured into intricate shapes. Although, the advantages of copper were many, the material was too soft to find large scale usefulness. Through experimentation or by chance, additions to copper lead to increased hardness of a new metal alloy, called bronze.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-3) Bronze was originally composed of copper and arsenic, forming arsenic bronze.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-4)

[Iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron") working came into prominence from about 1,200 BCE. In the 10th century BCE, [glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass "Glass") production began in [ancient Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Near_East "Ancient Near East"). In the 3rd century BCE, people in [ancient India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India "History of India") developed [wootz steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wootz_steel "Wootz steel"), the first [crucible steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible_steel "Crucible steel"). In the 1st century BCE, [glassblowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassblowing "Glassblowing") techniques flourished in [Phoenicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia "Phoenicia"). In the 2nd century, CE [steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel "Steel")-making became widespread in [Han dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty "Han dynasty") China. The 4th century CE saw the production of the [Iron pillar of Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_pillar_of_Delhi "Iron pillar of Delhi"), the oldest surviving example of corrosion-resistant steel.

The [Pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome "Pantheon, Rome") in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome").

[Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood "Wood"), [bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone "Bone"), [stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology) "Rock (geology)"), and [earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") are some of the materials, which formed the structures of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"). Certain structures were made possible by the character of the land upon which these structures are built. Romans mixed powdered limestone, volcanic ash found from Mount Vesuvius, and water to make a cement paste.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-5) A volcanic peninsula with stone aggregates and [conglomerates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(geology) "Conglomerate (geology)") containing [crystalline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal") material will produce material, which weathers differently from soft, sedimentary rock and silt. With the discovery of cement paste, structures could be built with irregular shaped stones and have the binder fill the voids to create a solid structure. The cement gains strength as it [hydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrate "Hydrate"), thus creating a stronger bond over time. With the fall of the west [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") and the rise of the [Byzans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire"), this knowledge was mostly lost except to the catholic monks, who were among the few who could read Vitruviusâ€™ Latin and make use of the concrete paste.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-6) That is one of the reasons that the [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete "Concrete")[Pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome "Pantheon, Rome") of [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome") could last for 1,850 years, and why the [thatched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatch "Thatch")[farmhouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmhouse "Farmhouse") of [Holland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland "Holland") sketched by [Rembrandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt "Rembrandt") have long since decayed.

The use of [asbestos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos "Asbestos") as a material blossomed in [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"), especially when the fireproofing qualities of the material came to light. Many scholars believe the word _[asbestos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/asbestos#English "wikt:asbestos")_ comes from an Ancient Greek term, á¼„ÏƒÎ²ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¿Ï‚ (_Ã¡sbestos_), meaning "inextinguishable" or "unquenchable".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-7)Clothes for nobles, table clothes and other oven adornments were all furnished with a weave of the fibrous materials, as the materials could be cleansed by throwing them directly into fire.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-8) The use of this material however was not without its downsides, [Pliny the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder "Pliny the Elder"), noted a link between the quick death of slaves to work in the asbestos mine. He recommended that slaves working in this environment use the a bladder skin as a makeshift [respirator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respirator "Respirator").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-9)

After the [thigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh "Thigh")[bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone "Bone")[daggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger "Dagger") of the early [hunter-gatherers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer") were superseded by wood and stone axes, and then by [copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper "Copper"), [bronze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze "Bronze") and [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron") implements of the Roman civilization, more precious materials could then be sought, and gathered together. Thus the [medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval "Medieval") goldsmith [Benvenuto Cellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benvenuto_Cellini "Benvenuto Cellini") could seek and defend the gold which he had to turn into objects of desire for [dukes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke "Duke") and [popes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope "Pope"). _[The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Autobiography\_of\_Benvenuto\_Cellini "The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini")_ contains one of the first descriptions of a metallurgical process.

The use of [cork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(material) "Cork (material)"), which has been recently added to the category of materials science, had its first mentions beginning with [Horace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace "Horace"), Pliny, and [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-:1-10) It had many uses in antiquity including in fishing and safety devices because of its buoyancy, an engraving medium, sandal soles to increase stature, container stoppers, and being an insulator. It was also used to help cure baldness in the second century.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-11)

In the Ancient Roman Era, glassblowing became an art involving the additions of decor and tints. They were also able to created complex shapes due to the use of a mold. This technology allowed them to imitate gemstones.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-:02-12) Window glass was formed by casting into flat clay molds then removed and cleaned.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-:02-12) The texture in stained glass comes from the texture the sand mold left on the side in contact with the mold.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-:02-12)

Polymeric composites also made an appearance during this time frame in the form of [wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood "Wood"). By 80 BC, petrified [resin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin "Resin") and [keratin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin "Keratin") were used in accessories as [amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber "Amber") and tortoise shell respectively.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-:1-10)

In Alexandria in the first century BC, [glass blowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassblowing "Glassblowing") was developed in part due to new furnaces that could create higher temperatures by using a clay coated reed pipe.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-:02-12) Plant ash and natron glass, the latter being the primary component, were used in blown pieces. Coastal and semi desert plants worked best due to their low [magnesium oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_oxide "Magnesium oxide") and [potassium oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_oxide "Potassium oxide") content. The [Levant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant "Levant"), [North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa"), and [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") were where blown glass vessels were most common.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-13)

Proto-porcelain material has been discovered dating back to the Neolithic period, with shards of material found in archaeological sites from the Eastern Han period in China. These wares are estimated to have been fired from 1260Â°C to 1300Â°C.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-14) In the 8th century, [porcelain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcelain "Porcelain") was invented in [Tang dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty "Tang dynasty"), China. Porcelain in china resulted in a methodical development of widely used kilns that increased the quality and quantity that porcelain could be produced.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-15)[Tin-glazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin-glazing "Tin-glazing") of ceramics is invented by [Arabic chemists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy_and_chemistry_in_Islam "Alchemy and chemistry in Islam") and [potters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_pottery "Islamic pottery") in [Basra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basra "Basra"), [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-Mason-16)

During the Early Middle Ages, the technique of creating windows steered more towards glass blowing non-tinted balls that were later flattened, but then in the late Middle Ages; the methodology returned to that from antiquity with a few minor adjustments, which included rolling with metallic rollers.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-:02-12)

In the 9th century, [stonepaste ceramics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneware "Stoneware") were invented in [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq"),[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-Mason-16) and [lustreware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustreware "Lustreware") appeared in [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-17) In the 11th century, [Damascus steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_steel "Damascus steel") is developed in the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East"). In the 15th century, [Johann Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gutenberg "Johann Gutenberg") develops [type metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_metal "Type metal") alloy and Angelo Barovier invents [cristallo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristallo "Cristallo"), a clear soda-based glass.

In 1540, [Vannoccio Biringuccio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannoccio_Biringuccio "Vannoccio Biringuccio") publishes his _[De la pirotechnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_la\_pirotechnia "De la pirotechnia")_, the first systematic book on [metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy "Metallurgy"), in 1556 [Georg Agricola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Agricola "Georg Agricola") writes _[De Re Metallica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Re\_Metallica "De Re Metallica")_, an influential book on metallurgy and [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining "Mining"), and glass [lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics) "Lens (optics)") are developed in the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") and used for the first time in [microscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope "Microscope") and [telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope"). [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In the 17th century, [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo "Galileo")'s [Two New Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_New_Sciences "Two New Sciences") ([strength of materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_of_materials "Strength of materials") and [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics")) includes the first quantitative statements in the science of materials. [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In the 18th century, [William Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Champion_(metallurgist) "William Champion (metallurgist)") patents a process for the production of metallic [zinc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc "Zinc") by [distillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation "Distillation") from [calamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calamine "Calamine") and charcoal, [Bryan Higgins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Higgins "Bryan Higgins") was issued a [patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent "Patent") for hydraulic cement ([stucco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stucco "Stucco")) for use as an exterior [plaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster "Plaster"), and [Alessandro Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta "Alessandro Volta") makes a copper or zinc [acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid "Acid")[battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity) "Battery (electricity)").

In the 19th century, [Thomas Johann Seebeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Johann_Seebeck "Thomas Johann Seebeck") invents the [thermocouple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple "Thermocouple"), Joseph Aspin invents [Portland cement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement "Portland cement"), [Charles Goodyear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodyear "Charles Goodyear") invents [vulcanized rubber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcanization "Vulcanization"), [Louis Daguerre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Daguerre "Louis Daguerre") and [William Fox Talbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fox_Talbot "William Fox Talbot") invent [silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver "Silver")-based [photographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography "Photography") processes, [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") demonstrates color photography, and [Charles Fritts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fritts "Charles Fritts") makes the first [solar cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell "Solar cell") using [selenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium "Selenium") waffles. [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Before the early 1800s, [aluminum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum "Aluminum") had not been produced as an isolated metal. It wasn't until 1825 that; [Hans Christian Ã˜rsted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_%C3%98rsted "Hans Christian Ã˜rsted") discovered how to create elemental aluminum via the reduction of aluminum chloride. Since aluminum is a light element with good mechanical properties, it was widely sought to replace heavier less functional metals like silver and gold. Napoleon III used aluminum plates and utensils for his honored guests, while the rest were given silver.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-18) However, this process was still expensive and was still not able to produce the metal in large quantities.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-19)

In 1886, American [Charles Martin Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Martin_Hall "Charles Martin Hall") and Frenchman [Paul HÃ©roult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_H%C3%A9roult "Paul HÃ©roult") invented a process completely independent of each other to produce aluminum from aluminum oxide via electrolysis.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-20) This process would allow aluminum to be manufactured cheaper than ever before, and laid the groundwork for turning the element from a precious metal into an easily obtainable commodity. Around the same time in 1888, [Carl Josef Bayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Josef_Bayer "Carl Josef Bayer") was working in St Petersburg, Russia to develop a method to make pure alumina for the textile industry. This process involved dissolving the aluminum oxide out of the bauxite mineral to produce gibbsite, which can then be purified back into raw alumina. The [Bayer process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process "Bayer process") and the [Hall-HÃ©roult process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall-H%C3%A9roult_process "Hall-HÃ©roult process") are still used today to produce a majority of the world's alumina and aluminum.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-21)

Material science as a field of study
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_materials_science&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Material science as a field of study")]

Most fields of studies have a founding father, such as Newton in physics and Lavoisier in chemistry. Materials science on the other hand has no central figure.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-ReferenceA-22) In the 1940s, wartime collaborations of multiple fields of study to produce technological advances became a structure to the future field of study that would become known as material science and engineering.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-23) One of the reasons behind the advancements during this period was due to the cracking problems associated with the Liberty ships being used during WWII. Various reinforcements were applied to the Liberty ships to arrest the cracking problem, which were some of the first structural tests that gave birth to the study of materials. During the Cold War in the 1950s, US [President's Science Advisory Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Science_Advisory_Committee "President's Science Advisory Committee") (PSAC) made materials a priority, when it realized that materials were the limiting factor for advances in space and military technology. In 1958, President [Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower "Dwight D. Eisenhower") created the [Advanced Research Project Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA "DARPA") (ARPA),[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-24) referred to as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) since 1996. In 1960, ARPA encouraged the establishment of interdisciplinary laboratories (IDL's) on university campuses, which would be dedicated to the research of materials, as well as to the education of students on how to conduct materials science research.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-25) ARPA offered 4 year IDL contracts to universities, originally to [Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University "Cornell University"), [University of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania "University of Pennsylvania"), and [Northwestern University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University "Northwestern University"), eventually granting nine more contracts.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-:0-26) Although ARPA is no longer in control of the IDL program (the [National Science Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation "National Science Foundation") took over the program in 1972 [[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-:0-26)), the original establishment of IDL's marked a significant milestone in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States")' research and development of materials science. Several institutions departments changed titles from "metallurgy" to "metallurgy and materials science" in the 1960s.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-ReferenceA-22)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-27)

In the early part of the 20th century, most engineering schools had a department of [metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy "Metallurgy") and perhaps of [ceramics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic "Ceramic") as well. Much effort was expended on consideration of the [austenite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austenite "Austenite") - [martensite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martensite "Martensite") - [cementite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cementite "Cementite") phases found in the iron - carbon [phase diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram "Phase diagram") that underlies [steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel "Steel") production. [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The fundamental understanding of other materials was not sufficiently advanced for them to be considered as academic subjects. In the post WWII era, the systematic study of [polymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer "Polymer") advanced particularly rapidly. Rather than create new polymer science departments in engineering schools, administrators and scientists began to conceive of materials science as a new interdisciplinary field in its own right, one that considered all substances of engineering importance from a unified point of view. [Northwestern University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University "Northwestern University") instituted the first materials science department in 1955.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-28)

Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high temperature materials. He pioneered high temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the [Center for Advanced Materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Advanced_Materials "Center for Advanced Materials") (CAM**),** which supported many faculty and students from the [College of Earth and Mineral Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_College_of_Earth_and_Mineral_Sciences "Penn State College of Earth and Mineral Sciences"), the [Eberly College of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberly_College_of_Science "Eberly College of Science"), the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at [Penn State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University "Pennsylvania State University") on high temperature materials. His vision for interdisciplinary research played a key role in the creation of the Materials Research Institute. Tressler's contribution to materials science is celebrated with a Penn State lecture named in his honor.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-29)

The [Materials Research Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_Research_Society "Materials Research Society") (MRS)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-30) has been instrumental in creating an identity and cohesion for this young field in the US. MRS was the brainchild of researchers at [Penn State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_University "Penn State University") and grew out of discussions initiated by Prof. [Rustum Roy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rustum_Roy "Rustum Roy") in 1970. The first meeting of MRS was held in 1973. As of 2006 [_[needs update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_], MRS has grown into an international society that sponsors a large number of annual meetings and has over 13,000 members. MRS sponsors meetings that are subdivided into symposia on a large variety of topics as opposed to the more focused meetings typically sponsored by organizations like the [American Physical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Physical_Society "American Physical Society") or the [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE "IEEE"). The fundamentally interdisciplinary nature of MRS meetings has had a strong influence on the direction of science, particularly in the popularity of the study of [soft materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_materials "Soft materials"), which are in the nexus of biology, chemistry, physics and mechanical and electrical engineering. Because of the existence of integrative textbooks, [materials research societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_research_societies "Materials research societies") and university chairs in all parts of the world, BA, MA and PhD programs and other indicators of discipline formation, it is fair to call materials science (and engineering) a discipline.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-31)

The field of [crystallography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallography "Crystallography"), where [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-rays "X-rays") are shone through crystals of a solid material, was founded by [William Henry Bragg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Bragg "William Henry Bragg") and his son [William Lawrence Bragg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawrence_Bragg "William Lawrence Bragg") at the [Institute of Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Physics "Institute of Physics") during and after [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Materials science became a major established discipline following the onset of the [Silicon Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Age "Silicon Age") and [Information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age "Information Age"). This led to the development of modern [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers "Computers") and then [mobile phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phones "Mobile phones"), with the need to make them smaller, faster and more powerful leading to materials science developing smaller and lighter materials capable of dealing with more complex calculations. This in turn enabled computers to be used to solve complex crystallographic calculations and automate crystallography experiments, allowing researchers to design more accurate and powerful techniques. Along with computers and crystallography, the development of [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser") technology from 1960 onwards led to the development of [light-emitting diodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diodes "Light-emitting diodes") (used in [DVD players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_players "DVD players") and [smartphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphones "Smartphones")), [fibre-optic communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre-optic_communication "Fibre-optic communication") (used in global [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications "Telecommunications")), and [confocal microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy "Confocal microscopy"), a key tool in materials science.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_materials_science#cite_note-32)
