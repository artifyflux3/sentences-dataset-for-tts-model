Biography [ edit ] He was a native of Göttingen , the son of the Royal Hanovarian director general of schools Friedrich Kohlrausch . He was a high-school teacher of mathematics and physics successively at Lüneburg , Rinteln , Kassel and Marburg . In 1853 he became an associate professor at the University of Marburg , and four years later, a full professor of physics at the University of Erlangen .

[ 1 ] Research [ edit ] In 1854 Kohlrausch introduced the relaxation phenomena , and used the stretched exponential function to explain relaxation effects of a discharging Leyden jar (capacitor).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In an 1855 experiment (published 1857) with Wilhelm Weber (1804–1891), he demonstrated that the ratio of electrostatic to electromagnetic units produced a number similar to the value of the speed of light , [ 4 ] a constant which they named c {\displaystyle c} .

Kirchhoff recognized that the ratio is equal to 2 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} the speed of light.

[ 5 ] This finding was instrumental towards Maxwell's conjecture that light is an electromagnetic wave .

Family [ edit ] He was the father of physicist Friedrich Kohlrausch .
