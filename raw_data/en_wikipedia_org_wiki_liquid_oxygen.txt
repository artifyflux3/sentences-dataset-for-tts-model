Liquid oxygen ( O 2 ) ( cyan liquid) in a beaker.

When liquid oxygen ( O 2 ) is poured from a beaker into a strong magnet, the oxygen is temporarily suspended between the magnet poles, owing to its paramagnetism.

Liquid oxygen , sometimes abbreviated as LOX or LOXygen , is a clear, pale cyan liquid form of dioxygen O 2 . It was used as the oxidizer in the first liquid-fueled rocket invented in 1926 by Robert H. Goddard , [ 1 ] an application which is ongoing.

Physical properties [ edit ] Liquid oxygen has a clear, pale cyan color and is strongly paramagnetic : it can be suspended between the poles of a powerful horseshoe magnet .

[ 2 ] Liquid oxygen has a density of 1.141 kg/L (1.141 g/ml), slightly denser than liquid water, and is cryogenic with a freezing point of 54.36 K (−218.79 °C; −361.82 °F) and a boiling point of 90.19 K (−182.96 °C; −297.33 °F) at 1 bar (14.5 psi). Liquid oxygen has an expansion ratio of 1:861 [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and because of this, it is used in some commercial and military aircraft as a transportable source of breathing oxygen.

[ citation needed ] Liquid oxygen is also a very powerful oxidizing agent: organic materials will burn rapidly and energetically in liquid oxygen. Further, if soaked in liquid oxygen , some materials such as coal briquettes, carbon black , etc., can detonate unpredictably from sources of ignition such as flames, sparks or impact from light blows.

Petrochemicals , including asphalt , often exhibit this behavior.

[ 5 ] The tetraoxygen molecule (O 4 ) was predicted in 1924 by Gilbert N. Lewis , who proposed it to explain why liquid oxygen defied Curie's law .

[ 6 ] Modern computer simulations indicate that, although there are no stable O 4 molecules in liquid oxygen, O 2 molecules do tend to associate in pairs with antiparallel spins , forming transient O 4 units.

[ 7 ] Liquid nitrogen has a lower boiling point at −196 °C (77 K) than oxygen's −183 °C (90 K), and vessels containing liquid nitrogen can condense oxygen from air: when most of the nitrogen has evaporated from such a vessel, there is a risk that liquid oxygen remaining can react violently with organic material. Conversely, liquid nitrogen or liquid air can be oxygen-enriched by letting it stand in open air; atmospheric oxygen dissolves in it, while nitrogen evaporates preferentially.

[ citation needed ] The surface tension of liquid oxygen at its normal pressure boiling point is 13.2 dyn/cm (13.2 mN/m).

[ 8 ] Uses [ edit ] A U.S. Air Force technician transfers liquid oxygen to a Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules aircraft at the Bagram Airfield , Afghanistan.

In commerce, liquid oxygen is classified as an industrial gas and is widely used for industrial and medical purposes. Liquid oxygen is obtained from the oxygen found naturally in air by fractional distillation in a cryogenic air separation plant .

[ citation needed ] Insulated evaporator and storage container setup for liquid oxygen Air forces have long recognized the strategic importance of liquid oxygen, both as an oxidizer and as a supply of gaseous oxygen for breathing in hospitals and high-altitude aircraft flights. In 1985, the USAF started a program of building its own oxygen-generation facilities at all major consumption bases.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] In rocket propellant [ edit ] See also: Liquid rocket propellant SpaceX's liquid oxygen ball at Cape Canaveral Liquid oxygen is the most common cryogenic liquid oxidizer propellant for spacecraft rocket applications, usually in combination with liquid hydrogen , kerosene or methane .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Liquid oxygen was used in the first liquid fueled rocket . The World War II V-2 missile also used liquid oxygen under the name A-Stoff and Sauerstoff . In the 1950s, during the Cold War both the United States' Redstone and Atlas rockets, and the Soviet R-7 Semyorka used liquid oxygen. Later, in the 1960s and 1970s, the ascent stages of the Apollo Saturn rockets , and the Space Shuttle main engines used liquid oxygen.

[ citation needed ] As of 2025, many active rockets use liquid oxygen: Chinese space program CASC : Long March 5 , Long March 6 , Long March 7 , Long March 8 , Long March 12 , Long March 9 (under development) , Long March 10 (under development) Deep Blue Aerospace : Nebula-1 (under development) Galactic Energy : Pallas-1 (under development) i-Space : Hyperbola-3 (under development) LandSpace : Zhuque-2E , Zhuque-3 (under development) Orienspace : Gravity-2 (under development) Space Pioneer : Tianlong-2 , Tianlong-3 (under development) Europe European Space Agency : Ariane 6 Isar Aerospace : Spectrum (under development) Rocket Factory Augsburg : RFA One (under development) Indian Space Research Organisation : GSLV , LVM3 JAXA (Japan): H3 Korea Aerospace Research Institute : Nuri Roscosmos (Russia): Soyuz-2 , Angara United States Blue Origin : New Shepard , New Glenn Firefly Aerospace : Firefly Alpha NASA : Space Launch System Northrop Grumman : Antares 300 (under development) Rocket Lab : Electron , Neutron (under development) SpaceX : Falcon 9 , Falcon Heavy , Starship Stoke Space : Nova (under development) United Launch Alliance : Atlas V , Vulcan History [ edit ] By 1845, Michael Faraday had managed to liquefy most gases then known to exist. Six gases, however, resisted every attempt at liquefaction [ 13 ] and were known at the time as " permanent gases ". They were oxygen, hydrogen , nitrogen , carbon monoxide , methane , and nitric oxide .

In 1877, Louis Paul Cailletet in France and Raoul Pictet in Switzerland succeeded in producing the first droplets of liquid air.

[ 14 ] In 1883, Polish professors Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski produced the first measurable quantity of liquid oxygen.

SpaceX's initial plan will be to build a lox/methane rocket for a future upper stage codenamed Raptor. ... The new Raptor upper stage engine is likely to be only the first engine in a series of lox/methane engines.
