Life [ edit ] He was born in Amsterdam , the son of the famous cartographer Jodocus Hondius who had started a map-making business in the city. Henricus obtained the original plates of the Mercator 1569 world map , and published a 1606 version of it. After his father died in 1612 Henricus co-ran the business with his brother-in-law.

[ 1 ] In 1621 opened his own company in his hometown. The first time his name was mentioned in an atlas was in 1623 when he published the fifth edition of the Mercator-Hondius atlas. After 1628 Henricus partnered with the cartographer Jan Janssonius and together they continued the business. He died in Amsterdam.

He came from a different family from Hendrik Hondius I ; there were two families engaged in very similar activities at the same time.
