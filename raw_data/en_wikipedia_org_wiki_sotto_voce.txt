The speaker gives the impression of uttering involuntarily a truth which may surprise, shock, or offend.

Galileo Galilei 's (probably apocryphal ) utterance " Eppur si muove " (" And yet [the Earth] moves "), spoken after deciding to recant his heliocentric theory , is a legendary example of a sotto voce utterance.

[ 5 ] Uses [ edit ] Law [ edit ] In law, "sotto voce" on a transcript indicates a conversation heard below the hearing of the court reporter .

[ 6 ] Drama, literature, and rhetoric [ edit ] In drama, literature, and rhetoric , sotto voce is used to denote emphasis attained by lowering one's voice rather than raising it, similar to the effect provided by an aside . Also similar to an aside, sotto voce can be used to express a character's thoughts out loud. For example, in Chapter 4 of Jane Eyre , Charlotte Brontë uses the term sotto voce to describe Mrs. Reed's manner of speaking after arguing with Jane: 'I am not your dear; I cannot lie down. Send me to school soon, Mrs. Reed, for I hate to live here.' 'I will indeed send her to school soon', murmured Mrs. Reed, sotto voce ; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
