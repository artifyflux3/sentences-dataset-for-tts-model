[ 1 ] It is situated less than 1 mile (1.6 km) north from Grantham . To its north is Gonerby Moor, part of Great Gonerby civil parish, and the A1 road . It is 330 feet (101 m) above sea level and overlooks the Vale of Belvoir to the west and Grantham to the south.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Community [ edit ] Village sign in Great Gonerby The urban sprawl from Grantham in the 1990s has meant that the village is separated from the town by approximately 400 yards (366 m).

Great Gonerby, with about 825 houses, [ citation needed ] has a social club, village shop, post office, and the Recruiting Sergeant public house . Harry's Place, with seating for 10, is significant for being the smallest Michelin-starred restaurant.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The large parish church is dedicated to St Sebastian . It is part of the Barrowby and Great Gonerby Group of the Deanery of Grantham. The 2013 incumbent was Rev Peter Hopkins who retired in 2019. The Church currently runs without fixed ordained presence.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] A house called Cromwell's Cottage takes its name from the tradition that Oliver Cromwell based his troops here before attacking Grantham.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The local inhabitants are known as 'Clockpelters', from the habit of trying to strike the face of the church clock with stones or snowballs.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The clock dates from 1897.

[ 9 ] Transport [ edit ] The village gives its name to the Gonerby Moor services , which opened in January 1964.
