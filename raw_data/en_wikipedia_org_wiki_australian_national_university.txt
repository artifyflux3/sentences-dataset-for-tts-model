Its main campus in Acton encompasses seven teaching and research colleges, in addition to several national academies and institutes.

[ 13 ] Established in 1946, ANU is the only university to have been created by the Parliament of Australia .

[ a ] It traces its origins to Canberra University College , which was established in 1929 and was integrated into ANU in 1960.

[ 14 ] ANU enrols 13,329 undergraduate and 11,021 postgraduate students and employs 4,517 staff.

[ 15 ] The university's endowment stood at A$1.8 billion as of 2018.

[ 16 ] ANU counts six Nobel laureates and 49 Rhodes scholars [ 17 ] among its faculty and alumni .

[ 18 ] The university has educated the incumbent Governor-General of Australia , two former prime ministers , and more than a dozen current heads of government departments of Australia . The latest releases of ANU's scholarly publications are held through ANU Press online. The entry requirements of many programmes are selective with high ATAR scores requirements.

[ 19 ] History [ edit ] Post-war origins [ edit ] Calls for the establishment of a national university in Australia began as early as 1900.

[ 20 ] After the location of the nation's capital, Canberra , was determined in 1908, land was set aside for the ANU at the foot of Black Mountain in the city designs by Walter Burley Griffin .

[ 20 ] Establishment of the university was disrupted by World War II but resumed with the creation of the Department of Post-War Reconstruction in 1942, ultimately leading to the passage of the Australian National University Act 1946 by the Chifley government on 1 August 1946.

[ 20 ] Remains of the ANU homopolar generator designed by Mark Oliphant A group of eminent Australian scholars returned from overseas to join the university, including Sir Howard Florey (co-developer of medicinal penicillin ),  Sir Mark Oliphant (a nuclear physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project ), and Sir Keith Hancock (the Chichele Professor of Economic History at Oxford ). The group also included a New Zealander, Sir Raymond Firth (a professor of anthropology at LSE ), who had earlier worked in Australia for some years.

[ 20 ] Economist Sir Douglas Copland was appointed as ANU's first Vice-Chancellor and former Prime Minister Stanley Bruce served as the first Chancellor.

[ 21 ] ANU was originally organised into four centres—the Research Schools of Physical Sciences, Social Sciences and Pacific Studies and the John Curtin School of Medical Research .

[ 20 ] The first residents' hall, University House , was opened in 1954 for faculty members and postgraduate students.

Mount Stromlo Observatory , established by the federal government in 1924, became part of ANU in 1957. The first locations of the ANU Library , the Menzies and Chifley buildings, opened in 1963. The Australian Forestry School, located in Canberra since 1927, was amalgamated by ANU in 1965.

[ 14 ] Canberra University College [ edit ] Canberra University College (CUC) was the first institution of higher education in the national capital, having been established in 1929 and enrolling its first undergraduate pupils in 1930.

[ 20 ] [ 22 ] Its founding was led by Sir Robert Garran , one of the drafters of the Australian Constitution and the first Solicitor-General of Australia .

[ 23 ] CUC was affiliated with the University of Melbourne and its degrees were granted by that university.

[ 20 ] Academic leaders at CUC included historian Manning Clark , political scientist Finlay Crisp , poet A. D. Hope and economist Heinz Arndt .

[ 23 ] In 1960, CUC was integrated into ANU as the School of General Studies, initially with faculties in arts, economics, law and science. Faculties in Oriental studies and engineering were introduced later. Bruce Hall, the first residential college for undergraduates, opened in 1961.

[ 14 ] ANU School of Art located at the former Canberra High School building Modern era [ edit ] The Canberra School of Music and the Canberra School of Art combined in 1988 to form the Canberra Institute of the Arts , and amalgamated with the university as the ANU Institute of the Arts in 1992.

[ 14 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] ANU established its Medical School in 2002, after obtaining federal government approval in 2000.

[ 26 ] On 18 January 2003, the Canberra bushfires largely destroyed the Mount Stromlo Observatory .

[ 27 ] ANU astronomers now conduct research from the Siding Spring Observatory , which contains 10 telescopes including the Anglo-Australian Telescope .

[ 28 ] In February 2013, financial entrepreneur and ANU graduate Graham Tuckwell made the largest university donation in Australian history by giving $50 million to fund an undergraduate scholarship program at ANU.

[ 29 ] ANU is well known for its history of student activism and, in recent years, its fossil fuel divestment campaign , which is one of the longest-running and most successful in the country.

[ 30 ] The decision of the ANU Council to divest from two fossil fuel companies in 2014 was criticised by ministers in the Abbott government , but defended by Vice Chancellor Ian Young, who noted: On divestment, it is clear we were in the right and played a truly national and international leadership role. [...] [W]e seem to have played a major role in a movement which now seems unstoppable.

[ 31 ] As of 2014 [update] ANU holds investments in major fossil fuel companies.

[ 32 ] A survey conducted by the Australian Human Rights Commission in 2017 found that the ANU had the second-highest incidence of sexual assault and sexual harassment.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] 3.5 per cent of respondents from the ANU reported being sexually assaulted in 2016. Vice Chancellor Brian Schmidt apologised to victims of sexual assault and harassment.

[ 35 ] The ANU had funding and staff cuts in the School of Music in 2011–15 [ 36 ] and in the School of Culture, History and Language in 2016.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] However, there is a range of global (governmental) endowments available for Arts and Social Sciences, designated only for ANU.

[ 40 ] Some courses are now delivered online.

[ 41 ] ANU has exchange agreements in place for its students with many foreign universities, most notably in the Asia-Pacific region, including the National University of Singapore , the University of Tokyo , the University of Hong Kong , Peking University , Tsinghua University and Seoul National University . In other regions, notable universities include Université Paris Sciences et Lettres the George Washington University , the University of California , the University of Texas , the University of Toronto in North America and Imperial College London , King's College London , Sciences Po , ETH Zürich , Bocconi University , the University of Copenhagen and Trinity College Dublin in Europe.

Many university sites are of historical significance dating from the establishment of the national capital, with over 40 buildings recognised by the Commonwealth Heritage List and several others on local lists.

[ 46 ] With over 10,000 trees on its campus, [ 47 ] ANU won an International Sustainable Campus Network Award in 2009 [ 48 ] and was ranked the 2nd greenest university campus in Australia in 2011.

[ 49 ] Four of Australia's five learned societies are based at ANU—the Australian Academy of Science , the Australian Academy of the Humanities , the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and the Australian Academy of Law. The Australian National Centre for the Public Awareness of Science and the National Film and Sound Archive are also located at ANU, while the National Museum of Australia and CSIRO are situated next to the campus.

ANU occupies additional locations including Mount Stromlo Observatory on the outskirts of Canberra, Siding Spring Observatory near Coonabarabran , a campus at Kioloa on the South Coast of New South Wales and a research unit in Darwin .

[ 50 ] Drill Hall Gallery [ edit ] The Drill Hall Gallery is housed a drill hall dating from the 1940s, for use in training soldiers for the Second World War , and as base for 3rd Battalion, Werriwa Regiment . The interior was remodelled to create an art gallery in 1984, and in 2004 the building was heritage-listed . Temporary exhibitions of the national collection were held in the hall while the National Gallery of Australia was being built. ANU took over the hall in 1992 to exhibit its own collection of artworks, and also as a venue for temporary exhibitions.

[ 51 ] There are four separate exhibition spaces, which provide the venues not only for exhibitions developed by or in collaboration with the university, but also to accompany major conferences and public events. The venue hosts both national and international exhibitions.

Controversies [ edit ] 2023 attack [ edit ] In September 2023, an ex-student stabbed two female students and assaulted a male student with a frying pan. There were several injuries but no fatalities.

[ 154 ] ANU Chancellor Julie Bishop later called for the ACT government to explain why the university was not informed of the risk beforehand.

[ 155 ] Network compromise [ edit ] The network of the university was subject to serious compromise from 9 November to 21 December 2018. ABC News reported that the initial breach occurred when a phishing message was previewed.

2025 Review of Workplace Culture and Governance at the College of Health and Medicine [ edit ] In May 2025, the university released the findings of an independent review led by former Victorian Police Commissioner Christine Nixon into gender and cultural issues within the College of Health and Medicine. The review revealed widespread bullying , harassment , sexism , racial discrimination , and nepotism across the college and its constituent schools, including the John Curtin School of Medical Research , the School of Medicine and Psychology, and the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health. The review, based on interviews with 83 individuals and 67 written submissions, described a "remarkable tolerance" for misconduct, with reporting pathways often compromised by conflicts of interest. It identified entrenched dysfunction, a toxic "work until you drop" culture, and significant gender imbalances in senior academic positions. Since the commissioning of the review in 2024, the university closed the standalone College of Health and Medicine and merged it with the College of Science . Vice-Chancellor Genevieve Bell publicly apologised and committed to implementing all 17 recommendations, including structural reform and external monitoring.
