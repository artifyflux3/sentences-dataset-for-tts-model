House zum Ritter Biography [ edit ] He was born in Schaffhausen , and was active in Schaffhausen, Strasbourg and Baden-Baden as a wall and portrait painter. He made a great number of drawings for woodcuts (Bible scenes, allegories, etc.) which were published by the printer Sigmund Feyerabend in Frankfurt am Main , and Bernhart Jobin in Strasbourg.

Stimmer followed Hans Holbein the Younger , but developed his own mannerism . Among his wall paintings remain the "House zum Ritter" in Schaffhausen, although this was actually much restored and changed.
