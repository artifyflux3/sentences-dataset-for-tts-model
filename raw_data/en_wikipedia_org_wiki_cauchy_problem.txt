[ 1 ] A Cauchy problem can be an initial value problem or a boundary value problem (for this case see also Cauchy boundary condition ). It is named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy .

Formal statement [ edit ] For a partial differential equation defined on R n+1 and a smooth manifold S ⊂ R n+1 of dimension n ( S is called the Cauchy surface ), the Cauchy problem consists of finding the unknown functions u 1 , … … , u N {\displaystyle u_{1},\dots ,u_{N}} of the differential equation with respect to the independent variables t , x 1 , … … , x n {\displaystyle t,x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}} that satisfies [ 2 ] ∂ ∂ n i u i ∂ ∂ t n i = F i ( t , x 1 , … … , x n , u 1 , … … , u N , … … , ∂ ∂ k u j ∂ ∂ t k 0 ∂ ∂ x 1 k 1 … … ∂ ∂ x n k n , … … ) for i , j = 1 , 2 , … … , N ; k 0 + k 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + k n = k ≤ ≤ n j ; k 0 < n j {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&{\frac {\partial ^{n_{i}}u_{i}}{\partial t^{n_{i}}}}=F_{i}\left(t,x_{1},\dots ,x_{n},u_{1},\dots ,u_{N},\dots ,{\frac {\partial ^{k}u_{j}}{\partial t^{k_{0}}\partial x_{1}^{k_{1}}\dots \partial x_{n}^{k_{n}}}},\dots \right)\\&{\text{for }}i,j=1,2,\dots ,N;\,k_{0}+k_{1}+\dots +k_{n}=k\leq n_{j};\,k_{0}<n_{j}\end{aligned}}} subject to the condition, for some value t = t 0 {\displaystyle t=t_{0}} , ∂ ∂ k u i ∂ ∂ t k = ϕ ϕ i ( k ) ( x 1 , … … , x n ) for k = 0 , 1 , 2 , … … , n i − − 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{k}u_{i}}{\partial t^{k}}}=\phi _{i}^{(k)}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})\quad {\text{for }}k=0,1,2,\dots ,n_{i}-1} where ϕ ϕ i ( k ) ( x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle \phi _{i}^{(k)}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} are given functions defined on the surface S {\displaystyle S} (collectively known as the Cauchy data of the problem). The derivative of order zero means that the function itself is specified.

Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem [ edit ] The Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem states that If all the functions F i {\displaystyle F_{i}} are analytic in some neighborhood of the point ( t 0 , x 1 0 , x 2 0 , … … , ϕ ϕ j , k 0 , k 1 , … … , k n 0 , … … ) {\displaystyle (t^{0},x_{1}^{0},x_{2}^{0},\dots ,\phi _{j,k_{0},k_{1},\dots ,k_{n}}^{0},\dots )} , and if all the functions ϕ ϕ j ( k ) {\displaystyle \phi _{j}^{(k)}} are analytic in some neighborhood of the point ( x 1 0 , x 2 0 , … … , x n 0 ) {\displaystyle (x_{1}^{0},x_{2}^{0},\dots ,x_{n}^{0})} , then the Cauchy problem has a unique analytic solution in some neighborhood of the point ( t 0 , x 1 0 , x 2 0 , … … , x n 0 ) {\displaystyle (t^{0},x_{1}^{0},x_{2}^{0},\dots ,x_{n}^{0})} .
