Bohlen (26 June 1935 – 2 February 2016 [ citation needed ] ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] was a microwave electronics and communications engineer .

He designed and described numerous non- octave musical scales (alternative musical tunings and temperaments ), many based on combination tones , including the Bohlen–Pierce scale in 1972 (independently discovered by John R. Pierce in 1984, also a microwave electronics and communications engineer, six years later and Kees van Prooijen in 1978), [ 3 ] the A12 scale , and the 833 cents scale .

Bohlen began to question and investigate tunings in the early 1970s when a friend and graduate student at the Hamburg Hochschule für Musik und Theater asked him to begin recording concerts at the school. Bohlen asked students why all their music used twelve-tone equal temperament , including the octave, and, dissatisfied with the answers, began to investigate alternate tunings.
