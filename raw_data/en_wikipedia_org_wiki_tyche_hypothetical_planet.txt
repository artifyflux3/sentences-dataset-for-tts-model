This article is about the hypothetical planet. For the asteroid, see 258 Tyche .

An artist's rendering of the Oort cloud and the Kuiper belt (inset) Tyche ( / ˈ t aɪ k i / ) is a hypothetical gas giant located in the Solar System 's Oort cloud , first proposed in 1999 by astrophysicists John Matese, Patrick Whitman and Daniel Whitmire of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] They argued that evidence of Tyche's existence could be seen in a supposed bias in the points of origin for long-period comets . More recently, Matese [ 3 ] and Whitmire [ 4 ] re-evaluated the comet data and noted that Tyche, if it existed, would be detectable in the archive of data that was collected by NASA 's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) telescope.

[ 5 ] In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object with Tyche's characteristics, indicating that Tyche as hypothesized by Matese, Whitman, and Whitmire does not exist.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] History [ edit ] Matese, Whitmire and their colleague Patrick Whitman first proposed the existence of this planet in 1999, [ 9 ] based on observations of the orbits of long-period comets. Most astronomers agree that long-period comets (those with orbits of thousands to millions of years) have a roughly isotropic distribution; that is, they arrive at random from every point in the sky.

[ 10 ] Because comets are volatile and dissipate over time, astronomers suspect that they must be held in a spherical cloud tens of thousands of AU distant (known as the Oort cloud ) for most of their existence.

[ 10 ] However, Matese and Whitmire claimed that rather than arriving from random points across the sky as is commonly thought, comet orbits were in fact clustered in a band inclined to the orbital plane of the planets . Such clustering could be explained if they were disturbed by an unseen object at least as large as Jupiter , possibly a brown dwarf , located in the outer part of the Oort cloud .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] They also suggested that such an object might explain the trans-Neptunian object Sedna 's peculiar orbit.

[ 13 ] However, the sample size of Oort comets was small and the results were inconclusive.

[ 14 ] Orbit [ edit ] Whitmire and Matese speculated that Tyche's orbit would lie at approximately 500 times Neptune 's distance, some 15,000 AU (2.2 × 10 12 km) from the Sun , a little less than one quarter of a light year . This is well within the Oort cloud , whose boundary is estimated to be beyond 50,000 AU. It would have an orbital period of roughly 1.8 million years.

[ 15 ] A failed search of older IRAS data suggests that an object of 5 M J would need to have a distance greater than 10,000 AU.

[ 7 ] Such a planet would orbit in a plane different from the ecliptic, [ 16 ] and would probably have been in a wide-binary orbit at the time of its formation.

[ 7 ] Wide binaries may form through capture during the dissolution of a star's birth cluster .

[ 7 ] Mass [ edit ] General size comparison between the Sun, a low-mass star , a brown dwarf , and the planets Jupiter and Earth In 2011, Whitmire and Matese speculated that the hypothesized planet could be up to four times the mass of Jupiter and have a relatively high temperature of approximately 200 K (−73 °C; −100 °F), [ 7 ] due to residual heat from its formation and Kelvin–Helmholtz heating .

[ citation needed ] It would be insufficiently massive to undergo nuclear fusion reactions in its interior, a process that occurs in objects above roughly 13 Jupiter masses . Although more massive than Jupiter, Tyche would be about Jupiter's size since degenerate pressure causes massive gas giants to increase only in density, not in size, relative to their mass.

[ a ] If Tyche was to be found, it was expected to be found by the end of 2013 and only be 1–2 Jupiter masses.

[ 19 ] Origin of name [ edit ] Tyche ( τύχη , meaning "fortune" or "luck" in Greek ) was the Greek goddess of fortune and prosperity. The name was chosen to avoid confusion with an earlier similar hypothesis that the Sun has a dim companion named Nemesis , whose gravity triggers influxes of comets into the inner Solar System, leading to mass-extinctions on Earth .

Tyche was the name of the "good sister" of Nemesis .

[ 7 ] This name was first used for an outer Oort cloud object by J. Davy Kirkpatrick at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center of the California Institute of Technology.

[ 20 ] WISE mission [ edit ] The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) space telescope has completed an all-sky infrared survey that includes areas where Whitmire and Matese anticipate that Tyche may be found.

[ 7 ] On March 14, 2012, the first-pass all-sky survey catalog of the WISE mission was released.

[ 21 ] The co-added (AllWISE) post-cryo second survey of the sky was released at the end of 2013.

[ 22 ] On March 7, 2014, NASA reported that the WISE telescope had ruled out the possibility of a Saturn-sized object out to 10,000—28,000 AU, and a Jupiter-sized or larger object out to 26,000—82,000 AU (0.4 light-years ).

[ 6 ] [ 23 ] See also [ edit ] Kelvin–Helmholtz heating Nemesis (hypothetical star) Planet Nine Planets beyond Neptune Vulcan (hypothetical planet) Notes [ edit ] ^ A cold hydrogen-rich gas giant slightly more massive than Jupiter (below about 1.6 M J ) would be larger in volume than Jupiter, [ 17 ] but for higher masses, degenerate pressure will cause the planet to shrink, [ 17 ] and added mass is compensated for by increasing degeneracy pressure in the planetary core. For example, HD 17156 b is 3 M J with a radius of 96% of Jupiter and HD 80606 b is 4 M J with a radius of 92% of Jupiter.  Even the brown dwarf COROT-3b ( 22 M J ) is estimated to be about the volume of Jupiter. After 10 billion years of cooling, large gas giants are all very nearly Jupiter's radius, but more massive objects are slightly smaller.
