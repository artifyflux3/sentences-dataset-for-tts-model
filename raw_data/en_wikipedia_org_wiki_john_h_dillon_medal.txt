Dillon Country United States Presented by American Physical Society First award 1983 Website https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/dillon.cfm The John H. Dillon Medal is a medal that has been awarded annually by the American Physical Society (APS) since 1983. The recipients are  young polymer physicists chosen for "outstanding accomplishment and unusual promise in research in polymer physics" One medal is awarded each year to a nominee who received their terminal degree (e.g. PhD) less than 12 years prior to nomination. The award consists of a $2,000 prize, and $1000 allowance for traveling to the APS March Meeting to present their work, and receive the medal. The award is sponsored by Elsevier .
