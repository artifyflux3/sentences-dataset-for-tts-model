He was a member of the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross , attending the society's meetings in Vienna.

Biography [ edit ] He was born in Csigmó (today Cigmău), a village in the town of Algyógy (today Geoagiu , Hunedoara County ), located in the western part of Transylvania .

[ 2 ] Budai-Deleanu studied at Blaj gymnasium between 1772 and 1777, having Samuil Micu-Klein as a professor among others, and then at the College of Saint Barbara in Vienna between 1777 and 1779.

[ 1 ] He completed his studies with a doctorate at the University of Erlau in 1783.

[ 3 ] He settled in Lemberg (now Lviv in Ukraine) in 1797 as a royal counsellor.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] His main works are the first draft of Supplex Libellus Valachorum and an epic poem, entitled Țiganiada ("Gypsy Epic"), about a band of gypsies that fought alongside the army of Vlad the Impaler , the medieval ruler of Wallachia .

[ 1 ] He was one of the first proponents of the idea of the unification of the lands that now form Romania .

[ 6 ] He proposed that the union should be achieved under the rule of the Habsburgs , through the annexation of Wallachia and Moldavia into the Grand Principality of Transylvania .

[ 7 ] According to Budai-Deleanu, the Dacians did not have a role in the ethnogenesis of the Romanian people .

[ 8 ] He thought that the Dacians were the ancestors of the Poles .

[ 8 ] He promoted the purification of the Romanian language from loanwords, proposing that only borrowings from Italian and French should be permitted.

[ 9 ] He also strove for the replacement of the Cyrillic script with the Latin alphabet .

[ 9 ] Budai-Deleanu was the first scholar of Transylvanian School to state that Romanian did not develop from Classical Latin directly, but from the vulgar language spoken in Dacia.

[ 10 ] Budai-Deleanu died in Lemberg in 1820, aged 60.

Streets în Arad , Bucharest , Cluj-Napoca , Oradea , Sibiu , and Timișoara are named after him.
