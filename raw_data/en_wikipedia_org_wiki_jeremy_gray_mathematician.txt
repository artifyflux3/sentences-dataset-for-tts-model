Biography [ edit ] Gray studied mathematics at the University of Oxford from 1966 to 1969, and then at Warwick University , obtaining his PhD in 1980 under the supervision of Ian Stewart and David Fowler . He has worked at the Open University since 1974, and became a lecturer there in 1978. He also lectured at the University of Warwick from 2002 to 2017, teaching a course on the history of mathematics.

Gray was a consultant on the television series, The Story of Maths , [ 1 ] a co-production between the Open University and the BBC .

[ 2 ] He edits Archive for History of Exact Sciences .

In 1998 he was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.

[ 3 ] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 4 ] Books [ edit ] Gray has been awarded prizes for his contributions to mathematics, including the Albert Leon Whiteman Memorial Prize from the American Mathematical Society in 2009, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] the Otto Neugebauer Prize of the European Mathematical Society in 2016, [ 7 ] and the London Mathematical Society 's Hirst Prize and Lectureship in 2018.
