The angle depends on the segment length a between the right angle and the vertex of the angle of parallelism.

Given a point not on a line, drop a perpendicular to the line from the point. Let a be the length of this perpendicular segment, and Π Π ( a ) {\displaystyle \Pi (a)} be the least angle such that the line drawn through the point does not intersect the given line. Since two sides are asymptotically parallel, lim a → → 0 Π Π ( a ) = 1 2 π π and lim a → → ∞ ∞ Π Π ( a ) = 0.

{\displaystyle \lim _{a\to 0}\Pi (a)={\tfrac {1}{2}}\pi \quad {\text{ and }}\quad \lim _{a\to \infty }\Pi (a)=0.} There are five equivalent expressions that relate Π Π ( a ) {\displaystyle \Pi (a)} and a : sin ⁡ ⁡ Π Π ( a ) = sech ⁡ ⁡ a = 1 cosh ⁡ ⁡ a = 2 e a + e − − a , {\displaystyle \sin \Pi (a)=\operatorname {sech} a={\frac {1}{\cosh a}}={\frac {2}{e^{a}+e^{-a}}}\ ,} cos ⁡ ⁡ Π Π ( a ) = tanh ⁡ ⁡ a = e a − − e − − a e a + e − − a , {\displaystyle \cos \Pi (a)=\tanh a={\frac {e^{a}-e^{-a}}{e^{a}+e^{-a}}}\ ,} tan ⁡ ⁡ Π Π ( a ) = csch ⁡ ⁡ a = 1 sinh ⁡ ⁡ a = 2 e a − − e − − a , {\displaystyle \tan \Pi (a)=\operatorname {csch} a={\frac {1}{\sinh a}}={\frac {2}{e^{a}-e^{-a}}}\ ,} tan ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 2 Π Π ( a ) ) = e − − a , {\displaystyle \tan \left({\tfrac {1}{2}}\Pi (a)\right)=e^{-a},} Π Π ( a ) = 1 2 π π − − gd ⁡ ⁡ ( a ) , {\displaystyle \Pi (a)={\tfrac {1}{2}}\pi -\operatorname {gd} (a),} where sinh, cosh, tanh, sech and csch are hyperbolic functions and gd is the Gudermannian function .

Construction [ edit ] János Bolyai discovered a construction which gives the asymptotic parallel s to a line r passing through a point A not on r .

[ 1 ] Drop a perpendicular from A onto B on r . Choose any point C on r different from B . Erect a perpendicular t to r at C . Drop a perpendicular from A onto D on t . Then length DA is longer than CB , but shorter than CA . Draw a circle around C with radius equal to DA . It will intersect the segment AB at a point E . Then the angle BEC is independent of the length BC , depending only on AB ; it is the angle of parallelism. Construct s through A at angle BEC from AB .

{\displaystyle \sin BEC={\frac {\sinh {BC}}{\sinh {CE}}}={\frac {\sinh {BC}}{\sinh {DA}}}={\frac {\sinh {BC}}{\sin {ACD}\sinh {CA}}}={\frac {\sinh {BC}}{\cos {ACB}\sinh {CA}}}={\frac {\sinh {BC}\tanh {CA}}{\tanh {CB}\sinh {CA}}}={\frac {\cosh {BC}}{\cosh {CA}}}={\frac {\cosh {BC}}{\cosh {CB}\cosh {AB}}}={\frac {1}{\cosh {AB}}}\,.} See Trigonometry of right triangles for the formulas used here.

History [ edit ] The angle of parallelism was developed in 1840 in the German publication "Geometrische Untersuchungen zur Theory der Parallellinien"  by Nikolai Lobachevsky .

This publication became widely known in English after the Texas professor G. B. Halsted produced a translation in 1891. ( Geometrical Researches on the Theory of Parallels ) The following passages define this pivotal concept in hyperbolic geometry: The angle HAD between the parallel HA and the perpendicular AD is called the parallel angle (angle of parallelism) which we will here designate by Π(p) for AD = p .

[ 2 ] : 13 [ 3 ] Demonstration [ edit ] The angle of parallelism, Φ , formulated as: (a) The angle between the x-axis and the line running from x , the center of Q , to y , the y-intercept of Q, and (b) The angle from the tangent of Q at y to the y-axis.

This diagram, with yellow ideal triangle , is similar to one found in a book by Smogorzhevsky.

[ 4 ] In the Poincaré half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane (see Hyperbolic motions ), one can establish the relation of Φ to a with Euclidean geometry . Let Q be the semicircle with diameter on the x -axis that passes through the points (1,0) and (0, y ), where y > 1. Since Q is tangent to the unit semicircle centered at the origin, the two semicircles represent parallel hyperbolic lines . The y -axis crosses both semicircles, making a right angle with the unit semicircle and a variable angle Φ with Q . The angle at the center of Q subtended by the radius to (0, y ) is also Φ because the two angles have sides that are perpendicular, left side to left side, and right side to right side.  The semicircle Q has its center at ( x , 0), x < 0, so its radius is 1 − x . Thus, the radius squared of Q is x 2 + y 2 = ( 1 − − x ) 2 , {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=(1-x)^{2},} hence x = 1 2 ( 1 − − y 2 ) .

{\displaystyle x={\tfrac {1}{2}}(1-y^{2}).} The metric of the Poincaré half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry parametrizes distance on the ray {(0, y ) : y > 0 } with logarithmic measure . Let the hyperbolic distance from (0, y ) to (0, 1) be a , so: log y − log 1 = a , so y = e a where e is the base of the natural logarithm . Then 
the relation between Φ and a can be deduced from the triangle {( x , 0), (0, 0), (0, y )}, for example: tan ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ = y − − x = 2 y y 2 − − 1 = 2 e a e 2 a − − 1 = 1 sinh ⁡ ⁡ a .

{\displaystyle \tan \phi ={\frac {y}{-x}}={\frac {2y}{y^{2}-1}}={\frac {2e^{a}}{e^{2a}-1}}={\frac {1}{\sinh a}}.} References [ edit ] ^ "Non-Euclidean Geometry" by Roberto Bonola, page 104, Dover Publications.
