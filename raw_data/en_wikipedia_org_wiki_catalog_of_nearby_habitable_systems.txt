The list was developed by scientists Jill Tarter and Margaret Turnbull under the auspices of Project Phoenix , a part of SETI .

The list was based upon the Hipparcos Catalogue (which has 118,218 stars) by filtering on a wide range of star system features. The current list contains 17,129 "HabStars".
