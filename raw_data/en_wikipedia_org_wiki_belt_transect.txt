[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The belt transect method is similar to the line transect method but gives information on abundance as well as presence, or absence of species.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Method [ edit ] The method involves laying out a transect line and then placing quadrats over the line, starting the quadrat at the first marked point of the line.

[ 5 ] Any consistent measurement size for the quadrat and length of the line can be chosen, depending on the species. With the quadrats applied, all the individuals of a species can be counted, and the species abundance can be estimated.

[ 5 ] The method is also suitable for long-term observations with a permanent installation.
