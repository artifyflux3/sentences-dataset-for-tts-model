[ 6 ] Criticism of animal rights [ edit ] Watson authored the article Self-consciousness and the Rights of Nonhuman Animals and Nature , which argued that most animals do not have rights such as the rights for freedom or from unnecessary suffering because they are not moral agents, do not possess self-consciousness, free will, or have the capability for understanding moral principles or the physical capability to act according to given principles of duty.
