**Atoms** are the basic particles of the [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element") and the fundamental building blocks of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"). An atom consists of a [nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus") of [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and generally [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron"), surrounded by an electromagnetically bound swarm of [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"). The chemical elements are distinguished from each other by the number of protons that are in their atoms. For example, any atom that contains 11 protons is [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium "Sodium"), and any atom that contains 29 protons is [copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper "Copper"). Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons are called [isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope") of the same element.

Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100[picometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picometer "Picometer") across. A human hair is about a million [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon") atoms wide. Atoms are smaller than the shortest wavelength of visible light, which means humans cannot see atoms with conventional microscopes. They are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics") is not possible due to [quantum effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics").

More than 99.94%[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-1) of an atom's [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") is in the nucleus. Protons have a positive [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") and neutrons have no charge, so the nucleus is positively charged. The electrons are negatively charged, and this opposing charge is what binds them to the nucleus. If the numbers of [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and electrons are equal, as they normally are, then the atom is electrically neutral as a whole. If an atom has more electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative charge and is called a negative [ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion") (or anion). Conversely, if it has more protons than electrons, it has a positive charge and is called a positive ion (or cation).

The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the [electromagnetic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_force "Electromagnetic force"). The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the [nuclear force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force "Nuclear force"). This force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force. In this case, the nucleus [splits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission "Nuclear fission") and leaves behind different elements. This is a form of [nuclear decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_decay "Nuclear decay").

Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by [chemical bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond") to form [chemical compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound "Chemical compound") such as [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") or [crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal"). The ability of atoms to attach and detach from each other is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature. [Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") is the science that studies these changes.

History of atomic theory
------------------------

### In philosophy

The basic idea that matter is made up of tiny indivisible particles is an old idea that appeared in many ancient cultures. The word _atom_ is derived from the [ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") word _atomos_,[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-2) which means "uncuttable". But this ancient idea was based in philosophical reasoning rather than scientific reasoning. Modern atomic theory is not based on these old concepts.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-3)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-4) In the early 19th century, the scientist [John Dalton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton "John Dalton") found evidence that matter really is composed of discrete units, and so applied the word _atom_ to those units.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-5)

### Dalton's law of multiple proportions

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Daltons_symbols.gif/250px-Daltons_symbols.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Daltons_symbols.gif)

Various atoms and molecules from _A New System of Chemical Philosophy_ (John Dalton 1808).

In the early 1800s, John Dalton compiled experimental data gathered by him and other scientists and discovered a pattern now known as the "[law of multiple proportions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_multiple_proportions "Law of multiple proportions")". He noticed that in any group of chemical compounds which all contain two particular chemical elements, the amount of Element A per measure of Element B will differ across these compounds by ratios of small [whole numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_numbers "Whole numbers"). This pattern suggested that each element combines with other elements in multiples of a basic unit of weight, with each element having a unit of unique weight. Dalton decided to call these units "atoms".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-6)

For example, there are two types of [tin oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_oxide_(disambiguation) "Tin oxide (disambiguation)"): one is a grey powder that is 88.1% tin and 11.9% [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"), and the other is a white powder that is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen. Adjusting these figures, in the grey powder there is about 13.5 g of oxygen for every 100 g of tin, and in the white powder there is about 27 g of oxygen for every 100 g of tin. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2. Dalton concluded that in the grey oxide there is one atom of oxygen for every atom of tin, and in the white oxide there are two atoms of oxygen for every atom of tin ([SnO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_oxide "Tin(II) oxide") and [SnO 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_dioxide "Tin dioxide")).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-7)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-8)

Dalton also analyzed [iron oxides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_oxide "Iron oxide"). There is one type of iron oxide that is a black powder which is 78.1% iron and 21.9% oxygen; and there is another iron oxide that is a red powder which is 70.4% iron and 29.6% oxygen. Adjusting these figures, in the black powder there is about 28 g of oxygen for every 100 g of iron, and in the red powder there is about 42 g of oxygen for every 100 g of iron. 28 and 42 form a ratio of 2:3. Dalton concluded that in these oxides, for every two atoms of iron, there are two or three atoms of oxygen respectively. These substances are known today as [iron(II) oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(II)_oxide "Iron(II) oxide") and [iron(III) oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_oxide "Iron(III) oxide"), and their formulas are FeO and Fe 2 O 3 respectively. Iron(II) oxide's formula is normally written as FeO, but since it is a crystalline substance we could alternately write it as Fe 2 O 2, and when we contrast that with Fe 2 O 3, the 2:3 ratio for the oxygen is plain to see.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-9)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-10)

As a final example: [nitrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide "Nitrous oxide") is 63.3% [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") and 36.7% oxygen, [nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide "Nitric oxide") is 44.05% nitrogen and 55.95% oxygen, and [nitrogen dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide "Nitrogen dioxide") is 29.5% nitrogen and 70.5% oxygen. Adjusting these figures, in nitrous oxide there is 80 g of oxygen for every 140 g of nitrogen, in nitric oxide there is about 160 g of oxygen for every 140 g of nitrogen, and in nitrogen dioxide there is 320 g of oxygen for every 140 g of nitrogen. 80, 160, and 320 form a ratio of 1:2:4. The respective formulas for these oxides are [N 2 O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide "Nitrous oxide"), [NO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide "Nitric oxide"), and [NO 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide "Nitrogen dioxide").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-11)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-12)

### Discovery of the electron

In 1897, [J. J. Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Thomson "J. J. Thomson") discovered that [cathode rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray "Cathode ray") can be deflected by electric and magnetic fields, which meant that cathode rays are not a form of light but made of electrically charged particles, and their charge was negative given the direction the particles were deflected in.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-13) He measured these particles to be 1,700 times lighter than [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") (the lightest atom).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-14) He called these new particles _corpuscles_ but they were later renamed _[electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron")_ since these are the particles that carry electricity.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-15) Thomson also showed that electrons were identical to particles given off by [photoelectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect") and radioactive materials.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-Thomson-16) Thomson explained that an electric current is the passing of electrons from one atom to the next, and when there was no current the electrons embedded themselves in the atoms. This in turn meant that atoms were not indivisible as scientists thought. The atom was composed of electrons whose negative charge was balanced out by some source of positive charge to create an electrically neutral atom. Ions, Thomson explained, must be atoms which have an excess or shortage of electrons.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-17)

### Discovery of the nucleus

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Geiger-Marsden_experiment_expectation_and_result.svg/250px-Geiger-Marsden_experiment_expectation_and_result.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geiger-Marsden_experiment_expectation_and_result.svg)

The [Rutherford scattering experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_scattering_experiments "Rutherford scattering experiments"): The extreme scattering of some alpha particles suggested the existence of a nucleus of concentrated charge.

The electrons in the atom logically had to be balanced out by a commensurate amount of positive charge, but Thomson had no idea where this positive charge came from, so he tentatively proposed that it was everywhere in the atom, the atom being in the shape of a sphere. This was the mathematically simplest hypothesis to fit the available evidence, or lack thereof. Following from this, Thomson imagined that the balance of electrostatic forces would distribute the electrons throughout the sphere in a more or less even manner.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-18) Thomson's model is popularly known as the [plum pudding model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum_pudding_model "Plum pudding model"), though neither Thomson nor his colleagues used this analogy.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-HonGoldstein2013-19) Thomson's model was incomplete, it was unable to predict any other properties of the elements such as [emission spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectra "Emission spectra") and [valencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valency_(chemistry) "Valency (chemistry)"). It was soon rendered obsolete by the discovery of the [atomic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus").

Between 1908 and 1913, [Ernest Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford "Ernest Rutherford") and his colleagues [Hans Geiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Geiger "Hans Geiger") and [Ernest Marsden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Marsden "Ernest Marsden") performed a series of experiments in which they bombarded thin foils of metal with a beam of [alpha particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particles "Alpha particles"). They did this to measure the scattering patterns of the alpha particles. They spotted a small number of alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°. This shouldn't have been possible according to the Thomson model of the atom, whose charges were too diffuse to produce a sufficiently strong electric field. The deflections should have all been negligible. Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny volume at the center of the atom and that the electrons surround this nucleus in a diffuse cloud. This nucleus carried almost all of the atom's mass. Only such an intense concentration of charge, anchored by its high mass, could produce an electric field that could deflect the alpha particles so strongly.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-Heilbron2003p64-68-20)

### Bohr model

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Bohr_atom_animation_2.gif/250px-Bohr_atom_animation_2.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bohr_atom_animation_2.gif)

The Bohr model of the atom, with an electron making instantaneous "quantum leaps" from one orbit to another with gain or loss of energy. This model of electrons in orbits is obsolete.

A problem in classical mechanics is that an accelerating charged particle radiates [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation"), causing the particle to lose [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy"). Circular motion counts as acceleration, which means that an electron orbiting a central charge should spiral down into that nucleus as it loses speed. In 1913, the physicist [Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr "Niels Bohr") proposed a new model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-stern20050516-21) This quantization was used to explain why the electrons' orbits are stable and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-bohr19221211-22) Bohr's model could only predict the emission spectra of hydrogen, not atoms with more than one electron.

### Discovery of protons and neutrons

Back in 1815, [William Prout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Prout "William Prout") observed that the atomic weights of many elements were multiples of hydrogen's atomic weight, which is in fact true for all of them if one takes [isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes "Isotopes") into account. In 1898, [J. J. Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Thomson "J. J. Thomson") found that the positive charge of a hydrogen ion is equal to the negative charge of an electron, and these were then the smallest known charged particles.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-23) Thomson later found that the positive charge in an atom is a positive multiple of an electron's negative charge.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-24) In 1913, [Henry Moseley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Moseley "Henry Moseley") discovered that the frequencies of X-ray emissions from an [excited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state "Excited state") atom were a mathematical function of its [atomic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number "Atomic number") and hydrogen's nuclear charge. In 1919, [Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford "Ernest Rutherford") bombarded [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") gas with [alpha particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle "Alpha particle") and detected [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") ions being emitted from the gas, and concluded that they were produced by alpha particles hitting and splitting the nuclei of the nitrogen atoms.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-25)

These observations led Rutherford to conclude that the hydrogen nucleus is a singular particle with a positive charge equal to the electron's negative charge.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-26) He named this particle "[proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton")" in 1920.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-27) The number of protons in an atom (which Rutherford called the "[atomic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number "Atomic number")"[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-28)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-29)) was found to be equal to the element's ordinal number on the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table "Periodic table") and therefore provided a simple and clear-cut way of distinguishing the elements from each other. The atomic weight of each element is higher than its proton number, so Rutherford hypothesized that the surplus weight was carried by unknown particles with no electric charge and a mass equal to that of the proton.

In 1928, [Walter Bothe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bothe "Walter Bothe") observed that [beryllium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium "Beryllium") emitted a highly penetrating, electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles. It was later discovered that this radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of [paraffin wax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin_wax "Paraffin wax"). Initially it was thought to be high-energy [gamma radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_radiation "Gamma radiation"), since gamma radiation had a similar effect on electrons in metals, but [James Chadwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chadwick "James Chadwick") found that the [ionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization "Ionization") effect was too strong for it to be due to electromagnetic radiation, so long as energy and momentum were conserved in the interaction. In 1932, Chadwick exposed various elements, such as hydrogen and nitrogen, to the mysterious "beryllium radiation", and by measuring the energies of the recoiling charged particles, he deduced that the radiation was actually composed of electrically neutral particles which could not be massless like the gamma ray, but instead were required to have a mass similar to that of a proton. Chadwick now claimed these particles as Rutherford's neutrons.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-30)

### The current consensus model

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/S-p-Orbitals.svg/250px-S-p-Orbitals.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:S-p-Orbitals.svg)

The modern model of atomic orbitals draws zones where an electron is most likely to be found at any moment.

In 1925, [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg") published the first consistent mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics ([matrix mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_mechanics "Matrix mechanics")).[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-Pais-31) One year earlier, [Louis de Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie "Louis de Broglie") had proposed that all particles behave like waves to some extent,[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-32) and in 1926 [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger") used this idea to develop the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation"), which describes electrons as three-dimensional [waveforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveform "Waveform") rather than points in space.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-33) A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") and [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") of a particle at a given point in time. This became known as the [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle"), formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-Pais-31) In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-34) Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described [atomic orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital "Atomic orbital") zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be found.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-brown2007-35)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-harrison2000-36) This model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and [spectral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line "Spectral line") patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen.

### Subatomic particles

Though the word _atom_ originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various [subatomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle "Subatomic particle"). The constituent particles of an atom are the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), the [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton"), and the [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron").

The electron is the least massive of these particles by four orders of magnitude at 9.11×10−31 kg, with a negative [electrical charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-37) It was the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured, until the discovery of [neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino") mass. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an [ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion"). Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to [J.J. Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.J._Thomson "J.J. Thomson"); see [history of subatomic physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_subatomic_physics "History of subatomic physics") for details.

Protons have a positive charge and a mass of 1.6726×10−27 kg. The number of protons in an atom is called its [atomic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number "Atomic number"). [Ernest Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford "Ernest Rutherford") (1919) observed that nitrogen under alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei. By 1920 he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton").

Neutrons have no electrical charge and have a mass of 1.6749×10−27 kg.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-38)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-2014_CODATA-39) Neutrons are the heaviest of the three constituent particles, but their mass can be reduced by the [nuclear binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy "Nuclear binding energy"). Neutrons and protons (collectively known as [nucleons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleon "Nucleon")) have comparable dimensions—on the order of 2.5×10−15 m—although the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-40) The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist [James Chadwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chadwick "James Chadwick").

In the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure, whereas protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") called [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark"). There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two [up quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_quark "Up quark") (each with charge +⁠2/3⁠) and one [down quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_quark "Down quark") (with a charge of −⁠1/3⁠). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-pdg2002-41)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-schombert2006-42)

The quarks are held together by the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction") (or strong force), which is mediated by [gluons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon"). The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the [nuclear force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force "Nuclear force"), which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of [gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_boson "Gauge boson"), which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-pdg2002-41)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-schombert2006-42)

All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny [atomic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"), and are collectively called [nucleons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleon "Nucleon"). The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to ![Image 7: {\displaystyle 1.07{\sqrt[{3}]{A}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a74a6ca6998768195969eef75ca046e8431c29d3)[femtometres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtometre "Femtometre"), where ![Image 8: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) is the total number of nucleons.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-43) This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 10 5 fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the [residual strong force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_strong_force "Residual strong force"). At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the [electrostatic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_force "Electrostatic force") that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-44)

Atoms of the same [element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element") have the same number of protons, called the [atomic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number "Atomic number"). Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the [isotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope") of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the [nuclide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclide "Nuclide"). The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay").[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-wenner2007-45)

The proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion"). Fermions obey the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle "Pauli exclusion principle") which prohibits _[identical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical\_particles "Identical particles")_ fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-raymond-46)

A nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match. As a result, atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay, but with increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-raymond-46)

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Wpdms_physics_proton_proton_chain_1.svg/250px-Wpdms_physics_proton_proton_chain_1.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wpdms_physics_proton_proton_chain_1.svg)

Illustration of a nuclear fusion process that forms a deuterium nucleus, consisting of a proton and a neutron, from two protons. A [positron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron "Positron") (e+)—an [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter "Antimatter") electron—is emitted along with an electron [neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino").

The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies because of the strong force. [Nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion "Nuclear fusion") occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3 to 10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the [coulomb barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_barrier "Coulomb barrier")—and fuse together into a single nucleus.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-mihos2002-47)[Nuclear fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission "Nuclear fission") is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-lbnl20070330-48)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-makhijani_saleska2001-49)

If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a [gamma ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray "Gamma ray"), or the kinetic energy of a [beta particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle "Beta particle")), as described by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [mass–energy equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence "Mass–energy equivalence") formula, _E = mc 2_, where _m_ is the mass loss and _c_ is the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"). This deficit is part of the [binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy "Binding energy") of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-50)

The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron") and [nickel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel "Nickel")—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an [exothermic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic_reaction "Exothermic reaction") that releases more energy than is required to bring them together.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-ajp63_7_653-51) It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per [nucleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleon "Nucleon") begins to decrease. That means that a fusion process producing a nucleus that has an atomic number higher than about 26, and a [mass number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_number "Mass number") higher than about 60, is an [endothermic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothermic_reaction "Endothermic reaction"). Thus, more massive nuclei cannot undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the [hydrostatic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium "Hydrostatic equilibrium") of a star.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-raymond-46)

### Electron cloud

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Potential_energy_well.svg/250px-Potential_energy_well.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Potential_energy_well.svg)

A potential well, showing, according to [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), the minimum energy _V_(_x_) needed to reach each position _x_. Classically, a particle with energy _E_ is constrained to a range of positions between _x_ 1 and _x_ 2.

The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the [electromagnetic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_force "Electromagnetic force"). This force binds the electrons inside an [electrostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic "Electrostatic")[potential well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_well "Potential well") surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.

Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a [particle and a wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality "Wave–particle duality"). The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional [standing wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave "Standing wave")—a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an [atomic orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital "Atomic orbital"), a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-science157_3784_13-52) Only a discrete (or [quantized](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quantize "wikt:quantize")) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-Brucat2008-53) Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and differ from each other in size, shape and orientation.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-manthey2001-54)

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Atomic-orbital-clouds_spdf_m0.png/500px-Atomic-orbital-clouds_spdf_m0.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atomic-orbital-clouds_spdf_m0.png)

3D views of some [hydrogen-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-like_atom "Hydrogen-like atom") atomic orbitals showing probability density and phase (**g** orbitals and higher are not shown)

Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular [energy level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level "Energy level") of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through [spontaneous emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_emission "Spontaneous emission"), an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for [atomic spectral lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_spectral_line "Atomic spectral line").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-Brucat2008-53)

The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron—the [electron binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_binding_energy "Electron binding energy")—is far less than the [binding energy of nucleons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy "Binding energy"). For example, it requires only 13.6 eV to strip a [ground-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_state "Stationary state") electron from a hydrogen atom,[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-herter_8-55) compared to 2.23 _million_ eV for splitting a [deuterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium "Deuterium") nucleus.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-pr79_2_282-56) Atoms are [electrically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called [ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion"). Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to [bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond") into [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") and other types of [chemical compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound "Chemical compound") like [ionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_crystal "Ionic crystal") and [covalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond "Covalent bond") network [crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallization "Crystallization").[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-57)

Properties
----------

### Nuclear properties

By definition, any two atoms with an identical number of _protons_ in their nuclei belong to the same [chemical element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element"). Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of _neutrons_ are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons ([hydrogen-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-1 "Hydrogen-1"), by far the most common form,[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-matis2000-58) also called protium), one neutron ([deuterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium "Deuterium")), two neutrons ([tritium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium "Tritium")) and [more than two neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_hydrogen "Isotopes of hydrogen"). The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single-proton element [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") up to the 118-proton element [oganesson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oganesson "Oganesson").[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-weiss20061017-59) All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83 ([bismuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth "Bismuth")) is so slight as to be practically negligible.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-s131-60)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-dume20030423-61)

About 339 nuclides occur naturally on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"),[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-lidsay20000730-62) of which 251 (about 74%) have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as "[stable isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope "Stable isotope")". Only 90 nuclides are stable [theoretically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclides "List of nuclides"), while another 161 (bringing the total to 251) have not been observed to decay, even though in theory it is energetically possible. These are also formally classified as "stable". An additional 35 radioactive nuclides have half-lives longer than 100 million years, and are long-lived enough to have been present since the birth of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"). This collection of 286 nuclides are known as [primordial nuclides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_nuclide "Primordial nuclide"). Finally, an additional 53 short-lived nuclides are known to occur naturally, as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay (such as [radium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium "Radium") from [uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium "Uranium")), or as products of natural energetic processes on Earth, such as cosmic ray bombardment (for example, carbon-14).[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-tuli2005-63)[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-64)

For 80 of the chemical elements, at least one [stable isotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope "Stable isotope") exists. As a rule, there is only a handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements, the average being 3.1 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six "[monoisotopic elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoisotopic_element "Monoisotopic element")" have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element [tin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin "Tin"). Elements [43](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium "Technetium"), [61](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethium "Promethium"), and all elements numbered [83](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth "Bismuth") or higher have no stable isotopes.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-CRC-65): 1–12

Stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain "magic numbers" of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the [shell model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_shell_model "Nuclear shell model") of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. Of the 251 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons _and_ odd number of neutrons: [hydrogen-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-2 "Hydrogen-2") ([deuterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium "Deuterium")), [lithium-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-6 "Lithium-6"), [boron-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron-10 "Boron-10"), and [nitrogen-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen-14 "Nitrogen-14"). ([Tantalum-180m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantalum-180m "Tantalum-180m") is odd-odd and observationally stable, but is predicted to decay with a very long half-life.) Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd-odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years: [potassium-40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40 "Potassium-40"), [vanadium-50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium-50 "Vanadium-50"), [lanthanum-138](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanthanum-138 "Lanthanum-138"), and [lutetium-176](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutetium-176 "Lutetium-176"). Most odd-odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to [beta decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay "Beta decay"), because the decay products are even-even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to [nuclear pairing effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-empirical_mass_formula#Pairing_term "Semi-empirical mass formula").[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-66)

### Mass

The large majority of an atom's mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make it up. The total number of these particles (called "nucleons") in a given atom is called the [mass number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_number "Mass number"). It is a positive integer and dimensionless (instead of having dimension of mass), because it expresses a count. An example of use of a mass number is "carbon-12," which has 12 nucleons (six protons and six neutrons).

The actual [mass of an atom at rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_mass "Invariant mass") is often expressed in [daltons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_(unit) "Dalton (unit)") (Da), also called the unified atomic mass unit (u). This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of [carbon-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-12 "Carbon-12"), which is approximately 1.66×10−27 kg.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-iupac-67)[Hydrogen-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom "Hydrogen atom") (the lightest isotope of hydrogen which is also the nuclide with the lowest mass) has an atomic weight of 1.007825 Da.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-chieh2001-68) The value of this number is called the [atomic mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass "Atomic mass"). A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number times the dalton (for example the mass of a nitrogen-14 is roughly 14 Da), but this number will not be exactly an integer except (by definition) in the case of carbon-12.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-nist_wc-69) The heaviest [stable atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_atom "Stable atom") is lead-208,[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-s131-60) with a mass of 207.976 6521 Da.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-audi2003-70)

As even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of [moles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit) "Mole (unit)"). One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about [6.022×10 23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant "Avogadro constant")). This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1 u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the [dalton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_(unit) "Dalton (unit)"), each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12 Da, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012 kg.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-iupac-67)

### Shape and size

Atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an [atomic radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_radius "Atomic radius"). This is a measure of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-Ghosh02-71) This assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a [chemical bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond"). The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms ([coordination number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_number "Coordination number")) and a [quantum mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") property known as [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)").[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-aca32_5_751-72) On the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table "Periodic table") of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right).[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-dong1998-73) Consequently, the smallest atom is [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium") with a radius of 32[pm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picometre "Picometre"), while one of the largest is [caesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium "Caesium") at 225 pm.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-74)

When subjected to external forces, like [electrical fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_field "Electrical field"), the shape of an atom may deviate from [spherical symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_symmetry "Spherical symmetry"). The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by [group-theoretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory") considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in [crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal"), where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at [low-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_symmetry "Crystal symmetry") lattice sites.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-Bethe1929-75)[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-76) Significant [ellipsoidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid "Ellipsoid") deformations have been shown to occur for sulfur ions[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-pssb2008-77) and [chalcogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcogen "Chalcogen") ions[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-mdpi2014-78) in [pyrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrite "Pyrite")-type compounds.

Atomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") (400–700[nm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre "Nanometre")) so they cannot be viewed using an [optical microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_microscope "Optical microscope"), although individual atoms can be observed using a [scanning tunneling microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope "Scanning tunneling microscope"). To visualize the minuteness of the atom, consider that a typical human hair is about 1 million carbon atoms in width.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-osu2007-79) A single drop of water contains about 2[sextillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextillion "Sextillion") (2×10 21) atoms of oxygen, and twice the number of hydrogen atoms.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-80) A single [carat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carat_(unit) "Carat (unit)")[diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond "Diamond") with a mass of 2×10−4 kg contains about 10 sextillion (10 22) atoms of [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon").[[note 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-81) If an apple were magnified to the size of the Earth, then the atoms in the apple would be approximately the size of the original apple.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-82)

### Radioactive decay

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Isotopes_and_half-life.svg/250px-Isotopes_and_half-life.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Isotopes_and_half-life.svg)

This diagram shows the [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life "Half-life") (T 1⁄2) of various isotopes with Z protons and N neutrons.

Every element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1 fm.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-splung-83)

The most common forms of radioactive decay are:[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-84)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-firestone20000522-85)

*   [Alpha decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay "Alpha decay"): this process is caused when the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons. The result of the emission is a new element with a lower [atomic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number "Atomic number").
*   [Beta decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay "Beta decay") (and [electron capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture "Electron capture")): these processes are regulated by the [weak force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_force "Weak force"), and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an [antineutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antineutrino "Antineutrino"), while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a [positron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron "Positron") and a [neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino"). The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.
*   [Gamma decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_decay "Gamma decay"): this process results from a change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state, resulting in the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The excited state of a nucleus which results in gamma emission usually occurs following the emission of an alpha or a beta particle. Thus, gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay.

Other more rare types of [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay") include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of [nucleons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleon "Nucleon") from a nucleus, or more than one [beta particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle "Beta particle"). An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is [internal conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conversion "Internal conversion")—a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called [spontaneous nuclear fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_fission "Spontaneous fission").

Each [radioactive isotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_isotope "Radioactive isotope") has a characteristic decay time period—the [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life "Half-life")—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an [exponential decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay "Exponential decay") process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-splung-83)

### Magnetic moment

Elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)"). This is analogous to the [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") of an object that is spinning around its [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass"), although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant") (ħ), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin 1⁄2 ħ, or "spin-1⁄2". In an atom, electrons in motion around the [nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus") possess orbital [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-hornak2006-86)

The [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") produced by an atom—its [magnetic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment "Magnetic moment")—is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field, but the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle "Pauli exclusion principle"), in which no two electrons may be found in the same [quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state"), bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-schroeder2-87)

In [ferromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism "Ferromagnetism") elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an [exchange interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_interaction "Exchange interaction"). When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. [Paramagnetic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetism "Paramagnetism") have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-schroeder2-87)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-goebel20070901-88)

The nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of [thermal equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_equilibrium "Thermal equilibrium"), but for certain elements (such as [xenon-129](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon "Xenon")) it is possible to [polarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_polarization "Spin polarization") a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called [hyperpolarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpolarization_(physics) "Hyperpolarization (physics)"). This has important applications in [magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging "Magnetic resonance imaging").[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-yarris1997-89)[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-90)

### Energy levels

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Atomic_orbital_energy_levels.svg/250px-Atomic_orbital_energy_levels.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atomic_orbital_energy_levels.svg)

These electron's energy levels (not to scale) are sufficient for ground states of atoms up to [cadmium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium "Cadmium") (5s 2 4d 10) inclusively. The top of the diagram is lower than an unbound electron state.

The [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy") of an electron in an atom is [negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number "Negative number") relative to when the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance") from the nucleus [goes to infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_at_infinity "Limit at infinity"); its dependence on the electron's [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(vector) "Position (vector)") reaches the [minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum "Minimum") inside the nucleus, roughly in [inverse proportion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_proportion "Inverse proportion") to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can occupy only a set of [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state") centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific [energy level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level "Energy level"); see [time-independent Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-independent_Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Time-independent Schrödinger equation") for a theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the [amount of energy needed to unbind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_potential "Ionization potential") the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of [electronvolts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt "Electronvolt") (eV). The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e., [stationary state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_state "Stationary state"), while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-zeghbroeck1998-91) The electron's energy increases along with [_n_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_quantum_number "Principal quantum number") because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on [ℓ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuthal_quantum_number "Azimuthal quantum number") is caused not by the [electrostatic potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_potential "Electrostatic potential") of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.

For an electron to [transition between two different states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_electron_transition "Atomic electron transition"), e.g. [ground state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_state "Ground state") to first [excited state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state "Excited state"), it must absorb or emit a [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels, according to the [Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr "Niels Bohr") model, what can be precisely calculated by the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation"). Electrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see [Electron properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital "Atomic orbital").

The energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency"), so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum").[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-92) Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-martin2007-93)

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Fraunhofer_lines.svg/500px-Fraunhofer_lines.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fraunhofer_lines.svg)

An example of absorption lines in a spectrum

When a continuous [spectrum of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum") is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark [absorption bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_band "Absorption band") in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of [emission lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_line "Emission line") from the photons emitted by the atoms.) [Spectroscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy "Spectroscopy") measurements of the strength and width of [atomic spectral lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_spectral_line "Atomic spectral line") allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-avogadro-94)

Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a [fine structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_structure "Fine structure") splitting. This occurs because of [spin–orbit coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin%E2%80%93orbit_interaction "Spin–orbit interaction"), which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-fitzpatrick20070216-95) When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the [Zeeman effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect "Zeeman effect"). This is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple [electron configurations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration "Electron configuration") with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-weiss2001-96) The presence of an external [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the [Stark effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stark_effect "Stark effect").[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-97)

If a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause [stimulated emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulated_emission "Stimulated emission") of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make [lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser"), which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-watkins_sjsu-98)

### Valence and bonding behavior

Valency is the combining power of an element. It is determined by the number of bonds it can form to other atoms or groups.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-99) The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the [valence shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_shell "Valence shell"), and the electrons in that shell are called [valence electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron "Valence electron"). The number of valence electrons determines the [bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond") behavior with other atoms. Atoms tend to [chemically react](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction") with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-reusch20070716-100) For example, a transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one-electron more than a filled shell, and others that are one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in the compound [sodium chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride "Sodium chloride") and other chemical ionic salts. Many elements display multiple valences, or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus, [chemical bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond") between these elements takes many forms of electron-sharing that are more than simple electron transfers. Examples include the element carbon and the [organic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compounds "Organic compounds").[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-chemguide-101)

The [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element") are often displayed in a [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table "Periodic table") that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the [noble gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas "Noble gas").[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-husted20031211-102)[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-baum2003-103)

### States

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Bose_Einstein_condensate.png/250px-Bose_Einstein_condensate.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bose_Einstein_condensate.png)

Graphic illustrating the formation of a [Bose–Einstein condensate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate "Bose–Einstein condensate")

Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") and [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure"). By varying the conditions, materials can transition between [solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid "Solid"), [liquids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid "Liquid"), [gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas"), and [plasmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)").[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-104) Within a state, a material can also exist in different [allotropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes "Allotropes"). An example of this is solid carbon, which can exist as [graphite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite "Graphite") or [diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond "Diamond").[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-pu49_7_719-105) Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as [dioxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioxygen "Dioxygen") and [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone "Ozone").

At temperatures close to [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero "Absolute zero"), atoms can form a [Bose–Einstein condensate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate "Bose–Einstein condensate"), at which point quantum mechanical effects, which are normally only observed at the atomic scale, become apparent on a macroscopic scale.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-106)[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-nist_bec-107) This super-cooled collection of atoms then behaves as a single [super atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_atom "Super atom"), which may allow fundamental checks of quantum mechanical behavior.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-colton_fyffe1999-108)

Identification
--------------

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Atomic_resolution_Au100.JPG/250px-Atomic_resolution_Au100.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atomic_resolution_Au100.JPG)

[Scanning tunneling microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope "Scanning tunneling microscope")[surface reconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_reconstruction "Surface reconstruction") image showing the individual atoms making up this [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold") ([100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_index "Miller index")) surface. The surface atoms deviate from the bulk [crystal structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure "Crystal structure") and arrange in columns several atoms wide with pits between them.

While atoms are too small to be seen, devices such as the [scanning tunneling microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope "Scanning tunneling microscope") (STM) enable their visualization at the surfaces of solids. The microscope uses the [quantum tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunneling "Quantum tunneling") phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would be insurmountable in the classical perspective. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two [biased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biasing "Biasing") electrodes, providing a tunneling current that is exponentially dependent on their separation. One electrode is a sharp tip ideally ending with a single atom. At each point of the scan of the surface the tip's height is adjusted so as to keep the tunneling current at a set value. How much the tip moves to and away from the surface is interpreted as the height profile. For low bias, the microscope images the averaged electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the local [density of the electronic states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_states "Density of states") near the [Fermi level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_level "Fermi level").[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-jacox1997-109)[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-nf_physics1986-110) Because of the distances involved, both electrodes need to be extremely stable; only then periodicities can be observed that correspond to individual atoms. The method alone is not chemically specific, and cannot identify the atomic species present at the surface.

Atoms can be easily identified by their mass. If an atom is [ionized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion") by removing one of its electrons, its trajectory when it passes through a [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") will bend. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom. The [mass spectrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry "Mass spectrometry") uses this principle to measure the [mass-to-charge ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-to-charge_ratio "Mass-to-charge ratio") of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include [inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductively_coupled_plasma_atomic_emission_spectroscopy "Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy") and [inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductively_coupled_plasma_mass_spectrometry "Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry"), both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-sab53_13_1739-111)

The [atom-probe tomograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_probe "Atom probe") has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using [time-of-flight mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight_mass_spectrometry "Time-of-flight mass spectrometry").[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-rsi39_1_83-112)

Electron emission techniques such as [X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy") (XPS) and [Auger electron spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auger_electron_spectroscopy "Auger electron spectroscopy") (AES), which measure the binding energies of the [core electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_electron "Core electron"), are used to identify the atomic species present in a sample in a non-destructive way. With proper focusing both can be made area-specific. Another such method is [electron energy loss spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_energy_loss_spectroscopy "Electron energy loss spectroscopy") (EELS), which measures the energy loss of an [electron beam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_beam "Electron beam") within a [transmission electron microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscope "Transmission electron microscope") when it interacts with a portion of a sample.

Spectra of [excited states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state "Excited state") can be used to analyze the atomic composition of distant [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"). Specific light [wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength") contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms. These colors can be replicated using a [gas-discharge lamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas-discharge_lamp "Gas-discharge lamp") containing the same element.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-lochner2007-113)[Helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium") was discovered in this way in the spectrum of the Sun 23 years before it was found on Earth.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-winter2007-114)

Origin and current state
------------------------

[Baryonic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryonic_matter "Baryonic matter") forms about 4% of the total energy density of the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe "Observable universe"), with an average density of about 0.25 particles/m 3 (mostly [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and electrons).[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-hinshaw20060210-115) Within a galaxy such as the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way"), particles have a much higher concentration, with the density of matter in the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium") (ISM) ranging from 10 5 to 10 9 atoms/m 3.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-116) The Sun is believed to be inside the [Local Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Bubble "Local Bubble"), so the density in the [solar neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neighborhood "Solar neighborhood") is only about 10 3 atoms/m 3.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-science259_5093_327-117) Stars form from dense clouds in the ISM, and the evolutionary processes of stars result in the steady enrichment of the ISM with elements more massive than hydrogen and helium.

Up to 95% of the Milky Way's baryonic matter are concentrated inside stars, where conditions are unfavorable for atomic matter. The total baryonic mass is about 10% of the mass of the galaxy;[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-118) the remainder of the mass is an unknown [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter").[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-nigel2000-119) High [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") inside stars makes most "atoms" fully ionized, that is, separates _all_ electrons from the nuclei. In [stellar remnants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_remnant "Stellar remnant")—with exception of their surface layers—an immense [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") make electron shells impossible.

### Formation

[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg/600px-Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg)

Periodic table showing the origin of each element. Elements from carbon up to sulfur may be made in small stars by the [alpha process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_process "Alpha process"). Elements beyond iron are made in large stars with slow neutron capture ([s-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-process "S-process")). Elements heavier than iron may be made in neutron star mergers or supernovae after the [r-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process "R-process").

Electrons are thought to exist in the Universe since early stages of the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang"). Atomic nuclei forms in [nucleosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis "Nucleosynthesis") reactions. In about three minutes [Big Bang nucleosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis "Big Bang nucleosynthesis") produced most of the [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"), [lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium "Lithium"), and [deuterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium "Deuterium") in the Universe, and perhaps some of the [beryllium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium "Beryllium") and [boron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron "Boron").[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-ns1794_42-120)[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-science267_5195_192-121)[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-hinshaw20051215-122)

Ubiquitousness and stability of atoms relies on their [binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy "Binding energy"), which means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons. Where the [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") is much higher than [ionization potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_potential "Ionization potential"), the matter exists in the form of [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)")—a gas of positively charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons. When the temperature drops below the ionization potential, atoms become [statistically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_physics "Statistical physics") favorable. Atoms (complete with bound electrons) became to dominate over [charged particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle "Charged particle") 380,000 years after the Big Bang—an epoch called [recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology) "Recombination (cosmology)"), when the expanding Universe cooled enough to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-abbott20070530-123)

Since the Big Bang, which produced no [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon") or [heavier elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number "Atomic number"), atomic nuclei have been combined in [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") through the process of [nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion "Nuclear fusion") to produce more of the element [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"), and (via the [triple-alpha process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process "Triple-alpha process")) the sequence of elements from carbon up to [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron");[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-mnras106_343-124) see [stellar nucleosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis "Stellar nucleosynthesis") for details.

Isotopes such as lithium-6, as well as some beryllium and boron are generated in space through [cosmic ray spallation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray_spallation "Cosmic ray spallation").[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-nature405_656-125) This occurs when a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.

Elements heavier than iron were produced in [supernovae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova "Supernova") and colliding [neutron stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star") through the [r-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process "R-process"), and in [AGB stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_giant_branch "Asymptotic giant branch") through the [s-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-process "S-process"), both of which involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-mashnik2000-126) Elements such as [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead "Lead") formed largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-kgs20050504-127)

### Earth

Most of the atoms that make up the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") and its inhabitants were present in their current form in the [nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebula") that collapsed out of a [molecular cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud "Molecular cloud") to form the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"). The rest are the result of radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can be used to determine the [age of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth "Age of the Earth") through [radiometric dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating "Radiometric dating").[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-Manuel2001pp511-519-128)[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-gs190_1_205-129) Most of the [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium") in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of [helium-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3 "Helium-3")) is a product of [alpha decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay "Alpha decay").[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-anderson_foulger_meibom2006-130)

There are a few trace atoms on Earth that were not present at the beginning (i.e., not "primordial"), nor are results of radioactive decay. [Carbon-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-14 "Carbon-14") is continuously generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-pennicott2001-131) Some atoms on Earth have been artificially generated either deliberately or as by-products of nuclear reactors or explosions.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-yarris2001-132)[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-pr119_6_2000-133) Of the [transuranic elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transuranium_element "Transuranium element")—those with atomic numbers greater than 92—only [plutonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium "Plutonium") and [neptunium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptunium "Neptunium") occur naturally on Earth.[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-poston1998-134)[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-cz97_10_522-135) Transuranic elements have radioactive lifetimes shorter than the current age of the Earth[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-136) and thus identifiable quantities of these elements have long since decayed, with the exception of traces of [plutonium-244](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium-244 "Plutonium-244") possibly deposited by cosmic dust.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-Manuel2001pp511-519-128) Natural deposits of plutonium and neptunium are produced by [neutron capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_capture "Neutron capture") in uranium ore.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-ofr_cut-137)

The Earth contains approximately 1.33×10 50 atoms.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-weisenberger-138) Although small numbers of independent atoms of [noble gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas "Noble gas") exist, such as [argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon "Argon"), [neon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon "Neon"), and [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"), 99% of [the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere") is bound in the form of molecules, including [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide") and [diatomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule "Diatomic molecule")[oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") and [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen"). At the surface of the Earth, an overwhelming majority of atoms combine to form various compounds, including [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water"), [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt "Salt"), [silicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate "Silicate"), and [oxides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide "Oxide"). Atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules, including [crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal") and liquid or solid [metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal "Metal").[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-pidwirnyf-139)[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-pnas99_22_13966-140) This atomic matter forms networked arrangements that lack the particular type of small-scale interrupted order associated with molecular matter.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-141)

### Rare and theoretical forms

#### Superheavy elements

All nuclides with atomic numbers higher than 82 ([lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead "Lead")) are known to be radioactive. No nuclide with an atomic number exceeding 92 ([uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium "Uranium")) exists on Earth as a [primordial nuclide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_nuclide "Primordial nuclide"), and heavier elements generally have shorter half-lives. Nevertheless, an "[island of stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability "Island of stability")" encompassing relatively long-lived isotopes of superheavy elements[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-cern28509-142) with atomic numbers [110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmstadtium "Darmstadtium") to [114](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flerovium "Flerovium") might exist.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-KarpovSHE-143) Predictions for the half-life of the most stable nuclide on the island range from a few minutes to millions of years.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-physorg-144) In any case, superheavy elements (with _Z_>104) would not exist due to increasing [Coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb "Coulomb") repulsion (which results in [spontaneous fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_fission "Spontaneous fission") with increasingly short half-lives) in the absence of any stabilizing effects.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-liquiddrop-145)

#### Exotic matter

Each particle of matter has a corresponding [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter "Antimatter") particle with the opposite electrical charge. Thus, the [positron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron "Positron") is a positively charged [antielectron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antielectron "Antielectron") and the [antiproton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiproton "Antiproton") is a negatively charged equivalent of a [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton"). When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance between the number of matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of [baryogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryogenesis "Baryogenesis") may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-koppes1999-146)[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-cromie20010816-147) In 1996, the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom ([antihydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihydrogen "Antihydrogen")) was synthesized at the [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN "CERN") laboratory in [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva "Geneva").[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-nature419_6906_439-148)[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-BBC20021030-149)

Other [exotic atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_atom "Exotic atom") have been created by replacing one of the protons, neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge. For example, an electron can be replaced by a more massive [muon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon "Muon"), forming a [muonic atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muonic_atom "Muonic atom"). These types of atoms can be used to test fundamental predictions of physics.[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-ns1728_77-150)[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-psT112_1_20-151)[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#cite_note-ripin1998-152)

Footnote by Ernest Rutherford: 'At the time of writing this paper in Australia, Professor Orme Masson was not aware that the name "proton" had already been suggested as a suitable name for the unit of mass nearly 1, in terms of oxygen 16, that appears to enter into the nuclear structure of atoms. The question of a suitable name for this unit was discussed at an informal meeting of a number of members of Section A of the British Association at Cardiff this year. The name "baron" suggested by Professor Masson was mentioned, but was considered unsuitable on account of the existing variety of meanings. Finally the name "proton" met with general approval, particularly as it suggests the original term "protyle " given by Prout in his well-known hypothesis that all atoms are built up of hydrogen. The need of a special name for the nuclear unit of mass 1 was drawn attention to by Sir Oliver Lodge at the Sectional meeting, and the writer then suggested the name "proton."'
