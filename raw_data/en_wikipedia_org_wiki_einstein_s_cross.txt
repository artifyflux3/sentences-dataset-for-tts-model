Four images of the same distant quasar (plus one in the centre, too dim to see) appear in the middle of the foreground galaxy due to strong gravitational lensing.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] This system was discovered by John Huchra and coworkers in 1985, although at the time they only detected that there was a quasar behind a galaxy based on differing redshifts and did not resolve the four separate images of the quasar.

[ 3 ] While gravitationally lensed light sources are often shaped into an Einstein ring , due to the elongated shape of the lensing galaxy and the quasar being off-centre, the images form a peculiar cross-shape instead.

[ 4 ] Other "Einstein crosses" have been discovered [ 5 ] [ 6 ] (see image below of one of them).

Details [ edit ] The quasar's redshift indicates that it is located about 8 billion light years from Earth, while the lensing galaxy is at a distance of 400 million light years.
The apparent dimensions of the entire foreground galaxy are 0.87 × 0.34 arcminutes , [ 7 ] while the apparent dimension of the cross in its centre accounts for only 1.6 × 1.6 arcseconds .

The Einstein Cross can be found in Pegasus at 22 h 40 m 30.3 s , +3° 21′ 31″.

Amateur astronomers are able to see some of the cross using telescopes; however, it requires extremely dark skies and telescope mirrors with diameters of 18 inches (46 cm) or greater.

[ 8 ] The individual images are labelled A through D (i.e.

QSO 2237+0305 A ), the lensing galaxy is sometimes referred to as QSO 2237+0305 G .
