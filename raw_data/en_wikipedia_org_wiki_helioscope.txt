Christoph Scheiner 's Helioscope A helioscope is an instrument used in observing the Sun and sunspots . 
The helioscope was first used by Benedetto Castelli (1578–1643) and refined by Galileo Galilei (1564–1642). The method involves projecting an image of the sun onto a white sheet of paper suspended in a darkened room with the use of a telescope.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The first machina helioscopica or helioscope was designed by Christoph Scheiner (1575 –1650) to assist his sunspot observations.

[ 3 ] In the context of modern astroparticle physics, the term helioscope can also refer to an experiment that seeks to observe hypothetical particles (such as the axion ) produced inside the sun. Examples of such helioscope experiments searching for axions include the CERN Axion Solar Telescope and International Axion Observatory .
