It was originally published in French in 1981 under the title Structures métriques pour les variétés riemanniennes , by CEDIC (Paris).

History [ edit ] The 1981 edition was edited by Jacques Lafontaine and Pierre Pansu . The English version, considerably expanded, was published in 1999 by Birkhäuser Verlag , with appendices by Pierre Pansu, Stephen Semmes , and Mikhail Katz . The book was well received [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and has been reprinted several times.
