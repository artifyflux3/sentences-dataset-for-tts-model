Drawing from the radical Enlightenment tradition, this book serves as a critique of Postcolonial Theory .

Chibber focuses on the Subaltern Studies section of the theory, and demonstrates how its foundational arguments are based on a series of political and historical misunderstandings.

[ 1 ] Content [ edit ] In his critique of postcolonial theory, Chibber argues that postcolonial theory characterizes all Enlightenment ideas as Eurocentric . Chibber asserts that the popular Subaltern Studies project has its foundational arguments rooted in analytical and historical misinterpretations. The main focus of the text is to demonstrate the possibility of a universalizing theory without reliance on Eurocentrism or reductionism .

[ 3 ] Reception [ edit ] Chibber's work received a mixture of positive reviews and criticism.

Noam Chomsky termed the text a "scrupulous and perceptive analysis", and "a very significant contribution." According to him, Chibber has succeeded in showing that "universalizing categories of Enlightenment thought" emerge unscathed from postcolonial criticism.

[ 1 ] Slavoj Zizek also gave it a strong positive review, calling it "the book we were all waiting for." According to Zizek, "this book simply sets the record straight, and puts postcolonialism into its place: at the heart of global Capitalist processes." [ 1 ] Robert Brenner , American quarterly magazine Jacobin , and the Los Angeles Review of Books also gave Chibber positive reviews.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] The book received criticism from Indian postcolonial theorist Gayatri Spivak in the Cambridge Review of International Affairs . Spivak asserted that Chibber may not be the best person to begin exposing the flaws of postcolonial theory.

[ 5 ] Chibber replied in the same journal, defending his choices in the original article.

[ 6 ] Chibber's publisher, Verso , would go on to publish The Debate on Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital, which brought together the major critics of Chibber's work.
