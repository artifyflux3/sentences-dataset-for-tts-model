The site maintains the list of the "5,000 largest known primes", selected smaller primes of special forms, and many "top twenty" lists for primes of various forms.

The PrimePages has articles on primes and primality testing . It includes "The Prime Glossary" with articles on hundreds of glosses related to primes, and "Prime Curios!" with thousands of curios about specific numbers.

The database started as a list of "titanic primes" (primes with at least 1000 decimal digits) by Samuel Yates in 1984.

[ citation needed ] On March 11, 2023, the PrimePages moved from primes.utm.edu to t5k.org, and is no longer maintained by Caldwell.
