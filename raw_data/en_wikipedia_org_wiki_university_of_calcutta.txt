History [ edit ] Pre-independence [ edit ] Fredrick John, the education secretary to the British Government in India, first tendered a proposal to them in London for the establishment of a university in Calcutta, along the lines of London University . In July 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company sent a dispatch, known as Wood's despatch , to the Governor General of India in Council, to establish universities in Calcutta , Madras , and Bombay .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The University of Calcutta in the late nineteenth century, by Francis Frith The Calcutta University Act came into force on 24 January 1857, and a 41-member Senate was formed as the policy-making body of the university. The land for the establishment of the university was given by Maharaja Maheshwar Singh Bahadur, who was the Maharaja of Darbhanga . When the university was first established, it had a jurisdiction from Kabul to Rangoon and Ceylon , the largest of any Indian university.

[ 5 ] Calcutta University was the first university east of Suez to teach European classics, English literature , European and Indian philosophy and Occidental and Oriental history.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] The first medical school in British India, the Calcutta Medical College , was affiliated with the university in 1857.

[ 8 ] The first college for women in India, Bethune College , is also affiliated with the university.

[ 9 ] From 1836 to 1890, Government Science College, Jabalpur , the first Indian science college, was affiliated with the University of Calcutta.

[ 10 ] The first university library began functioning in the 1870s.

Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Joddu Nath Bose became the first graduates of the university in 1858, and Kadambini Ganguly and Chandramukhi Basu were the first Indian female graduates in 1882.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The first chancellor and vice-chancellor of the Calcutta University were Governor General Lord Canning and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Sir William Colvile , respectively.

Ashutosh Mukherjee was the vice-chancellor for four consecutive two-year terms (1906–1914) and a fifth two-year term in 1921–23.

[ 3 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Calcutta Medical College in 1910 Initially, the university was only an affiliating and examining body. All the academic and teaching work was done in constituent colleges, which were the Presidency College , the Scottish Church College , the Sanskrit College , and the Bengal Engineering College . During that period, the Council Room of the Calcutta Medical College and the private residence of the vice-chancellor used to house the Senate meetings. The faculty councils generally met at the residences of the presidents of the faculties concerned, in the Civil Engineering College, or in the Writers' Building . Because of the lack of space, university examinations were conducted in the Kolkata Town Hall and in tents in the Maidan urban park.

[ 16 ] In 1866, a grant of ₹ 81,600 (equivalent to ₹ 37 million or US$440,000 in 2023) for the site and ₹ 170,561 (equivalent to ₹ 78 million or US$920,000 in 2023) was sanctioned to construct the new building on College Street . It opened in 1873 and was called Senate House. It had meeting halls for the Senate, a chamber for the vice-chancellor, the office of the registrar, examination rooms, and lecture halls. In 1904, postgraduate teaching and research began at the university, which led to an increase in the number of students and candidates. After almost sixty years, a second building, known as the Darbhanga Building, was erected in 1912 with a donation of ₹ 2.5 lakh (equivalent to ₹ 7.7 crore or US$910,000 in 2023) from Maharaja Maheshwar Singh Bahadur.

[ 16 ] The Darbhanga Building housed the University Law College , its library and some university offices and afforded space to hold university examinations on its top floor. In the same year, the Government of British India granted a sum of ₹ 8 lakh (equivalent to ₹ 25 crore or US$2.9 million in 2023) for the acquisition of a market, Madhab Babu's Bazar, situated adjacent to the Senate House, and construction of a new building for the teaching departments began. It opened in 1926, and was later named the Asutosh Building, after Asutosh Mukherjee, vice-chancellor of the university in 1906–14. Between 1912 and 1914, Taraknath Palit and Rash Behari Ghosh , two eminent lawyers, donated assets totalling ₹ 25 lakh (equivalent to ₹ 67 crore or US$7.9 million in 2023), and founded the University College of Science at Upper Circular Road (now known as Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road).

[ 16 ] Senate Hall of University of Calcutta, early 1910s Post-independence [ edit ] Before the partition of India , twenty-seven colleges from East Bengal (now Bangladesh) were affiliated with the university. The Government of West Bengal passed the Calcutta University Act of 1951, which substituted the earlier act of 1904 and ensured a democratic structure for the university. The West Bengal Secondary Education Act was passed in the same year, linking the university with the school leaving examination. Gradually, the requirements of the university grew, and the Senate House was becoming incapable of handling them. After the centenary of Calcutta University, the building was demolished to make space for a more utilitarian building. In 1957, the university's centenary year, it received a grant of ₹ 1 crore (equivalent to ₹ 100 crore or US$12 million in 2023) from the University Grants Commission, which aided with the construction of the Centenary Building on the College Street campus and the Law College Building on Hazra Road campus. The Economics Department got its own building in 1958 near Barrackpore Trunk Road . In 1965, the Goenka Hospital Diagnostic Research Centre for the University College of Medicine was opened as the university health service. Until 1960, Senate House was one of the city's most prominent landmarks.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] The University of Calcutta building on College Street In 1968, the Centenary Building opened on the former location of the Senate House. Currently, it houses the Central Library, the Asutosh Museum of Indian Art , the centenary auditorium and a number of university offices. By the mid-1970s, it had become one of the largest universities in the world. It had 13 colleges under its direct control and more than 150 affiliated colleges, along with 16 postgraduate faculties.

[ 18 ] In the year 2001, the University of Calcutta was awarded the 'Five-Star' status in the first cycle of the university's accreditation by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). In 2009 and 2017, the NAAC awarded its highest grade of 'A' to the University of Calcutta in the second and third cycle of the university's accreditation.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] In 2019, the university's central library and 40 departmental libraries were opened to the public. They have over one million books and more than 200,000 journals, proceedings and manuscripts.

[ 21 ] [ 16 ] Seal [ edit ] The seal has changed multiple times over the years. The first seal dates back to 1857. It was changed when the Government of India Act 1858 was passed by the British parliament . This brought the government and territories of the East India Company , including the University of Calcutta, under the British Crown . Seal three, four and five were introduced in the 1930s; the fourth seal faced criticism locally. The current university seal is the modified version of the sixth seal. The motto Advancement of Learning has remained the same through the seal's transitions.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] Jurisdiction [ edit ] Main articles: List of colleges affiliated to the University of Calcutta and List of centres affiliated to the University of Calcutta At one time, the university had a huge catchment area in British India , ranging from Lahore in the west to Rangoon in east and Ceylon in the south. Colleges like Thomason Engineering College (now IIT Roorkee), Muhammedan Anglo-Oriental College (now Aligarh Muslim University ), Canning College, Lucknow (now University of Lucknow ), King George Medical College (now King George's Medical University ), etc. were affiliated to the university. Schools situated in districts like Rawalpindi , Lahore , Jaypur , Cawnpur, and Mussoorie used to prepare and send students for the university entrance examination. No provisions to curtail territorial control were made after establishment of University of Punjab and Allahabad in 1882 and 1887 respectively. After the Indian Universities Act of 1904 came in, however, for the first time, the university's control was curtailed to Bengal (which included Orissa and Bihar), Assam and Burma provinces. In the act, the Governor-General-in-Council was given the power to the limit territorial jurisdiction of the five universities; Calcutta, Bombay , Madras , the Punjab and Allahabad.

[ 39 ] Following the Government of British India notification on 20 August 1904, Ceylon went under the University of Madras; provinces, states and agencies of Central India, such as the Central India Agency , Rajputana Agency , United Provinces of Agra and Oudh etc. went to the hands of University of Allahabad; Northern and North-Western provinces and states went under the University of Punjab. Jurisdiction of schools and colleges in Eastern India was retained by Calcutta University. By 1907, two colleges in Punjab, three in the Central Province, five in the State of Rajputana Agency, six in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh and seven in Ceylon were disaffiliated. A series of disaffiliations continued till 1948. Schools and colleges in Orissa and Bihar province went under University of Patna after its establishment in 1917.

[ 43 ] To provide agricultural education and research, the Institute of Agricultural Science was established under the University of Calcutta. It was founded by Pabitra Kumar Sen , who was the Khaira Professor of Agriculture (another endowment chair) in the early 1950s. Initial efforts began as early as 1913, but the first institute was set up only in 1939 at Barrackpore (a city near Kolkata) by the university, following the establishment of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research (now known as the Indian Council of Agricultural Research) in 1926.

[ 45 ] Although it was shut down in 1941 due to World War II . Then, in 1954, a postgraduate department in agriculture was started in Ballygunge Science College by the university, with agricultural botany as the only subject; two years later, a Veterinary Science Institute was included and the department was upgraded into a faculty called agriculture and veterinary science. In 2002 university decided to reopen undergraduate agriculture courses in the agricultural experiment farm campus at Baruipur , a city south of Calcutta.
