[ 1 ] One version of the Atheist's wager suggests that since a kind and loving god would reward good deeds – and that if no gods exist, good deeds would still leave a positive legacy – one should live a good life without religion.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] This argument assumes that if a god exists, they are benevolent and just, rather than arbitrary or punitive in their judgment of human actions. This contrasts with Pascal's wager , which presumes a god who rewards belief and punishes disbelief regardless of moral conduct. Philosophers such as John Schellenberg have argued that a perfectly just deity would be more likely to reward sincere moral behavior and intellectual honesty rather than belief for its own sake.

[ 4 ] Another formulation suggests that a god may reward honest disbelief and punish a dishonest belief in the divine.

[ 5 ] Explanation [ edit ] Martin's wager states that if one were to analyze one's options in regard to how to live one's life, one would arrive at the following possibilities: [ 2 ] [ 6 ] One may live a good life and believe in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case one goes to heaven: one's gain is infinite.

One may live a good life without believing in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case one goes to heaven: your gain is infinite.

One may live a good life and believe in a god, but no benevolent god exists, in which case one leaves a positive legacy to the world; one's gain is finite.

One may live a good life without believing in a god, and no benevolent god exists, in which case one leaves a positive legacy to the world; one's gain is finite.

One may live an evil life and believe in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case one goes to hell: one's loss is infinite.

One may live an evil life without believing in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case one goes to hell: one's loss is infinite.

One may live an evil life and believe in a god, but no benevolent god exists, in which case one leaves a negative legacy to the world; one's loss is finite.

One may live an evil life without believing in a god, and no benevolent god exists, in which case one leaves a negative legacy to the world; one's loss is finite.

The following table shows the values assigned to each possible outcome: A benevolent god exists No benevolent god exists Belief in god (B) No belief in god (¬B) Belief in god (B) No belief in god (¬B) Good life (L) +∞ (heaven) +∞ (heaven) +X (positive legacy) +X (positive legacy) Evil life (¬L) −∞ (hell) −∞ (hell) −X (negative legacy) −X (negative legacy) Given these values, Martin argues that the option to live a good life clearly dominates the option of living an evil life, regardless of belief in a god. Whether one believes in god has no effect on the outcome.
