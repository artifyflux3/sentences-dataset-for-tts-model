[ 7 ] It was founded in 1994 in the wake of the Republican takeover of the House; the Republican House caucus came to be dominated by conservatives.

[ 8 ] It has historically been considered a centre [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 9 ] to centre-right congressional caucus, with its members primarily from competitive House districts .

[ 8 ] [ 10 ] However, it has shifted further to the right in recent years under Trumpism . In January 2025, member Carlos A. Giménez stated "Our goals are the same as President Trump’s goals." [ 11 ] In 2007, the Tuesday Group founded its own political action committee .

[ 12 ] The name of the PAC was "Tuesday Group Political Action Committee" but has since changed to "Republican Governance Group/Tuesday Group Political Action Committee".  It is based in Tampa, Florida .

[ 13 ] Another major group of Republican moderates in Congress is the Republican Main Street Caucus , which existed briefly from 2017 to 2019 and was re-formed in 2021.
