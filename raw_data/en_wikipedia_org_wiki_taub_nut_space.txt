j uː ˈ t iː / ) is an exact solution to Einstein's equations . It may be considered a first attempt in finding the metric of a spinning black hole. It is sometimes also used in homogeneous but anisotropic cosmological models formulated in the framework of general relativity .

[ citation needed ] The underlying Taub space was found by Abraham Haskel Taub ( 1951 ), and extended to a larger manifold by Ezra T. Newman , Louis A. Tamburino, and Theodore W. J. Unti ( 1963 ), whose initials form the "NUT" of "Taub–NUT".

Description [ edit ] Taub's solution is an empty space solution of Einstein's equations with topology R × S 3 and metric (or equivalently line element ) g = − − d t 2 / U ( t ) + 4 l 2 U ( t ) ( d ψ ψ + cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ d ϕ ϕ ) 2 + ( t 2 + l 2 ) ( d θ θ 2 + ( sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) 2 d ϕ ϕ 2 ) {\displaystyle g=-dt^{2}/U(t)+4l^{2}U(t)(d\psi +\cos \theta d\phi )^{2}+(t^{2}+l^{2})(d\theta ^{2}+(\sin \theta )^{2}d\phi ^{2})} where U ( t ) = 2 m t + l 2 − − t 2 t 2 + l 2 {\displaystyle U(t)={\frac {2mt+l^{2}-t^{2}}{t^{2}+l^{2}}}} and m and l are positive constants.

Taub's metric has coordinate singularities at U = 0 , t = m + ( m 2 + l 2 ) 1 / 2 {\displaystyle U=0,t=m+(m^{2}+l^{2})^{1/2}} , and Newman, Tamburino and Unti showed how to extend the metric across these surfaces.

Related work [ edit ] Kerr metric [ edit ] When Roy Kerr developed the Kerr metric for spinning black holes in 1963, he ended up with a four-parameter solution, one of which was the mass and another the angular momentum of the central body. One of the two other parameters was the NUT-parameter, which he threw out of his solution because he found it to be nonphysical since it caused the metric to be not asymptotically flat, [ 2 ] [ 3 ] while other sources interpret it either as a gravomagnetic monopole parameter of the central mass, [ 4 ] or a twisting property of the surrounding spacetime.

[ 5 ] Misner spacetime [ edit ] A simplified 1+1-dimensional version of the Taub–NUT spacetime is the Misner spacetime .
