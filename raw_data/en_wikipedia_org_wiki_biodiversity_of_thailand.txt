The birds of Thailand number nearly one thousand species, of which approximately 45 are rare or accidental. At least seven bird species previously found in Thailand have since been made locally extinct , and approximately fifty of Thailand's bird species are globally threatened.

[ 2 ] In 1991, it was estimated that 159 resident and 23 migratory species were endangered or vulnerable due to forest clearance, illegal logging , hunting and habitat degradation, especially in the lowlands. The species most affected are large water birds whose wetland habitat has been largely lost to agriculture, and forest species, as deforestation for agriculture and logging have removed and degraded portions of the woodlands.

[ 3 ] Insects [ edit ] Cicada Ants [ edit ] Main article: List of ants of Thailand Butterflies [ edit ] Further information: List of butterflies of Thailand There are about 1,100 known butterfly species from Thailand.

[ 4 ] Bhutanitis lidderdalii Papilio clytia Papilio paradoxus Parantica aglea Parantica melaneus Tirumala limniace Tirumala septentrionis Molluscs [ edit ] Main article: List of non-marine molluscs of Thailand There are at least 23 known families, 57 genera and 125 species of land gastropods from Eastern Thailand.

[ 5 ] There are at least 8 known species of freshwater gastropods and at least 2 species of freshwater bivalves from the Sakaeo Province in the Eastern Thailand.

[ 6 ] Flora [ edit ] Flora of Thailand Garden angelica Luculia gratissima Meconopsis villosa Persicaria affinis Ruellia capitata See also [ edit ] Wildlife of Phitsanulok Province Environmental issues in Thailand References [ edit ] ^ This list is derived from the IUCN Red List which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
