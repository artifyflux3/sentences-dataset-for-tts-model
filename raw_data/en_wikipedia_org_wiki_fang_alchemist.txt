[ 1 ] She was the earliest recorded woman alchemist in China.

She is only known under her family name Fang. Raised in a scholarly family skilled in the alchemical arts, she studied alchemy with one of the Emperor Han Wudi 's spouses and thus had access to the highest levels of society. Fang's husband was Cheng Wei ( simplified Chinese : 程伟 ; traditional Chinese : 程偉 ).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] She accomplished feats her husband could not.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Fang was credited with the discovery of the method to turn mercury into silver. It was believed that she may have used the chemical technique of silver extraction from ores using mercury, where pure silver residue is left behind from the boiled mercury.

Fang eventually went insane and committed suicide. Details of Fang's life were recorded by author and alchemist Ge Hong .
