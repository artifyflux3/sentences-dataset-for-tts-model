He was a physician , and an eromenos [ 1 ] of the philosopher Empedocles , who dedicated his poem On Nature to him .

[ 2 ] There is an extant a Greek epigram on this Pausanias, which the Greek Anthology attributes to Simonides , [ 3 ] but Diogenes Laërtius to Empedocles .

[ 4 ] These two sources also differ as to whether he was born or buried at Gela in Sicily.

Notes [ edit ] ^ Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 60: "Pausanias, according to Aristippus and Satyrus , was his eromenos " ^ Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 60; Suda, Apnous ; Galen, De Meth. Med.
