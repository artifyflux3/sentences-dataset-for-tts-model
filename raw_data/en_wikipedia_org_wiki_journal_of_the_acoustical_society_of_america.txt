[ 2 ] History [ edit ] In 1929, the newly formed Acoustical Society of America Publication Committee began investigating how to start a journal. The first issue of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA) was published in October 1929 and contained 8 papers. The cover featured the 1929 logo designed by Wallace Waterfall . In May 1932, publication of JASA was transferred to the American Institute of Physics (AIP). In 1957 the publication frequency of the journal went from bimonthly to monthly. In the early 1990s JASA began accepting and publishing papers online and in 1994, began issuing past volumes of JASA on CD-ROM . In 1999, the ASA president, Robert Apfel, initiated the journal Acoustics Research Letters Online (ARLO) which was eventually renamed JASA Express Letters and included as a section of JASA from 2006 to 2020.

JASA Express Letters became an independent journal in 2021.
