( October 2017 ) ISO 128 is an international standard of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), covering the general principles of presentation in technical drawings, specifically the graphical representation of objects on technical drawings.

[ 1 ] Establishing notability [ edit ] The following independent, high‑quality sources provide significant coverage of ISO 128: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Overview [ edit ] Since 2003 the ISO 128 family has expanded to fifteen parts, initiated between 1996 and 2003. The standard begins with a summary of general rules for the execution and structure of technical drawings. It then describes basic conventions for lines, views, cuts and sections, and different types of engineering drawings—including mechanical, architectural, civil, and shipbuilding. ISO 128 applies to both manual and computer-based drawings, but not to three-dimensional CAD models.

[ 1 ] The ISO 128 series replaced the earlier DIN 6 standard for drawings, projections, and views, first published in 1922 and updated in 1950 and 1968. ISO 128 itself debuted in 1982 as a 15‑page document specifying general presentation principles for orthographic projection methods.

[ 5 ] Several parts of ISO 128 have been updated individually, and new parts added (e.g., Part 15 in 2013). The most recent revisions were published in 2020 and 2022.
