Kuwait is a country in West Asia at the head of the Persian Gulf , located between Iraq and Saudi Arabia .

Introduction [ edit ] The wildlife of Kuwait reflects the country's desert environment and coastal ecosystems. Despite its arid climate , Kuwait is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including desert-adapted plants, migratory birds , and marine species. The country's location along major migratory routes makes it a vital stopover for birds, while its coastal waters support rich marine biodiversity. Conservation efforts, including nature reserves and environmental policies, aim to protect this fragile ecosystem.

Geography [ edit ] See also: Geography of Kuwait Kuwait spans 17,820 km 2 (6,880 sq mi), stretching about 200 km (124 mi) from north to south and 170 km (106 mi) from east to west. It boasts a coastline of 195 km (121 mi) along the Persian Gulf and includes nine islands, the largest being Bubiyan Island , which is known for its significance in regional biodiversity. The main geographical feature is the expansive Kuwait Bay , offering a natural harbor where Kuwait City is located.

[ 2 ] The country largely consists of undulating flat land interspersed with low hills. It is divided into four zones: Desert plateau : Located to the west, this area supports arid flora such as Rhanterium epapposum (arfaj).

Salt marshes and mud flats : Surrounding Kuwait Bay , these saline depressions provide habitats for aquatic and migratory bird species, including flamingos and other waders.

Sand dunes : Found to the east, these dunes serve as refuge for desert reptiles like the Arabian sand boa .

Desert plain : Occupying the bulk of the country, this region hosts hardy vegetation and mammals like the desert hedgehog .

[ 3 ] Wadi al-Batin flowing through the borders of Kuwait and Iraq Climate [ edit ] See also: Climate of Kuwait Kuwait experiences an arid climate . Summers are intensely hot and dry, with average daily temperatures around 43 °C (109 °F), while winters are mild with average temperatures of 13 °C (55 °F), and occasional night frosts. Rainfall is sparse, averaging less than 8 cm (3.1 in) annually, and occurs mainly in winter as unpredictable showers or during thunderstorms in spring.

[ 3 ] Dust storms are frequent, particularly in spring and summer, often affecting visibility and disrupting ecosystems. Kuwait's proximity to Iraq and Iran contributes to colder winters compared to other Arabian Peninsula countries.

[ 4 ] These conditions directly shape Kuwait's wildlife. The arid climate supports unique flora such as salt-tolerant halophytes and drought-resistant acacia species. It also influences fauna by favoring desert-adapted species like the Arabian oryx and migratory birds like the greater flamingo , which are often seen at the Shuwaikh seaside and Sulaibikhat Bay near Kuwait City during winter.

[ 5 ] Additionally, the Persian Gulf's rich marine biodiversity is sustained by Kuwait's coastal geography, providing habitats for green sea turtles , crabs , mollusks , and over 100 fish species.

[ 6 ] Flora [ edit ] Rhanterium epapposum Over 400 species of wild plants have been recorded in Kuwait. The arfaj ( Rhanterium epapposum ) is the national flower of Kuwait and is a symbol of resilience in the arid desert environment.

[ 7 ] This hardy shrub is commonly used as forage by camels and sheep due to its nutritional value, especially in drier regions.

Desert plants [ edit ] Desert plants in Kuwait are typically coarse grasses, spiny shrubs, and salt-tolerant halophytes. These plants are adapted to survive the arid climate with minimal water. They thrive even in extreme conditions: Annual plants : About two-thirds of Kuwait's plant species are annuals . These plants grow rapidly after rainfall, often producing vibrant blue or purple flowers. Once seeds are set, these plants wither and die, ensuring their survival through dormant seeds during prolonged dry periods.

[ 8 ] Perennial plants : Smaller numbers of perennial shrubs and sub-shrubs also form an integral part of the ecosystem. These include salt-tolerant species that dominate coastal areas and saline depressions.

Environmental challenges [ edit ] The native flora is adapted to both semi-desert and full desert zones, making it valuable for studying human impacts on fragile ecosystems. The aftermath of the Gulf War caused significant changes to Kuwait's natural environment: Soil damage : Oil well fires caused large areas to be inundated with hydrocarbon residues, causing irreversible soil degradation and altered plant community dynamics.

[ 9 ] Urban expansion : Infrastructure development and overgrazing by livestock have further contributed to the loss of native vegetation.

Role of oases and coastal flora [ edit ] In oasis areas, date palms ( Phoenix dactylifera ) have been cultivated to provide shade and sustenance. Along the coastline and Kuwait Bay , mangroves and sea grasses thrive in mudflats. These plants play a critical role in stabilizing the coastline and providing habitats for marine life.

[ 8 ] Conservation significance [ edit ] Several native plant species, such as the Rhanterium epapposum , are vital to Kuwait's biodiversity. Efforts are ongoing to restore damaged ecosystems and safeguard endemic species through conservation programs. These programs aim to mitigate the impact of industrialization and desertification , ensuring the survival of Kuwait's wildlife.

Fauna [ edit ] Crab-plover eating a crab Main articles: List of birds of Kuwait and List of mammals of Kuwait Currently, 442 species of birds have been recorded in Kuwait, 18 of which breed in the country.

[ 10 ] Situated at the crossroads of several major bird migration routes, Kuwait sees an influx of between two and three million birds each year.

[ 11 ] The marshes in northern Kuwait and Jahra serve as critical refuges for passage migrants, while the islands play a vital role as breeding grounds for species such as terns and the Socotra cormorant .

[ 11 ] Migratory and resident birds [ edit ] The Mubarak Al-Kabeer Reserve Ramsar site on Bubiyan Island features lagoons and saltmarshes that host migrating wetland birds from Eurasia to Africa and those traveling from Turkey to India. This site also supports the world's largest breeding colony of crab-plovers .

[ 12 ] Common resident birds include the desert lark , while birds of prey like the kestrel and the short-toed snake eagle are frequently seen hunting over the desert plains.

[ 13 ] Seasonal visitors such as greater flamingos gather at coastal wetlands, including Shuwaikh seaside and Sulaibikhat Bay.

[ 5 ] The greater flamingo is one of Kuwait's iconic birds, especially the huge flocks that are seen in Sulaibikhat and Jahra Bays with up to 3000 recorded in early February 2008. They have also been recorded in inland pools in the Jahra area.

Reptiles and amphibians [ edit ] Kestral found in Kuwait Fox in Kuwait desert Eastern imperial eagle in Kuwait Eurasian eagle owl Desert cat in Kuwait Away from the coast, the harsh heat and lack of surface water demand specific adaptations for survival. Kuwait has one recorded amphibian species, the variable toad ( Bufotes variabilis ), and about 38 species of reptiles. These include: Arabian sand boa ( Eryx jayakari ): A burrowing snake that thrives in sandy habitats.

Black desert cobra ( Walterinnesia aegyptia ): A venomous snake endemic to arid regions.

Spiny-tailed lizards ( Uromastyx spp.): Known for their defensive behavior.

Frog-eyed gecko ( Teratoscincus scincus ): It burrows up to 1.2 m (4 ft) below the surface, where it remains cool and humid during scorching days.

[ 14 ] Mammals [ edit ] Kuwait hosts 28 recorded mammal species.

[ 9 ] Terrestrial mammals include desert-adapted creatures such as: Small desert rodents Desert hedgehog : Nocturnal and heat-tolerant.

Arabian oryx : Successfully reintroduced into protected areas.

Golden jackal , fennec fox , caracal , honey badger , and striped hyena , predators and scavengers uniquely suited to arid environments.

Gazelles : The Saudi gazelle and goitered gazelle remain icons of Kuwait's desert plains.

Marine mammals are also part of Kuwait's biodiversity, with the Persian Gulf waters home to species such as: the dugong , Bryde's whale , humpback whale , finless porpoise , and several dolphin species, including the Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin .

[ 15 ] Invertebrates and coastal fauna [ edit ] The wetlands and mudflats around Kuwait Bay are teeming with crabs , mudskippers , scorpions , and dung beetles . These regions also sustain numerous fish species, essential for both migratory waterfowl and marine ecosystems. Coastal zones host vibrant populations of waterfowl, gulls, and other wetland birds, contributing to Kuwait's ecological richness.

Environmental awareness: Organizations and campaigns work to educate citizens about biodiversity conservation.

Legislation: Laws have been enacted to limit hunting and protect endangered species.

[ 16 ] Threats [ edit ] Wildlife in Kuwait faces several threats: Desertification : Overgrazing and climate change exacerbate land degradation .

Pollution : Marine ecosystems are affected by oil spills and industrial waste.

Urban expansion : Development reduces natural habitats, affecting native species.
