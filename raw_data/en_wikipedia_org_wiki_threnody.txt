The term originates from the Greek word θρηνῳδία ( threnoidia ), from θρῆνος ( threnos , "wailing") and ᾠδή ( oide , "ode"), [ 1 ] [ 2 ] the latter ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root * h₂weyd- ("to sing") that is also the precursor of such words as "ode", "tragedy", "comedy", "parody", "melody" and "rhapsody".

Similar terms include " dirge ", " coronach ", " lament " and " elegy ". The Epitaphios Threnos is the lamentation chanted in the Eastern Orthodox Church on Holy Saturday .

John Dryden commemorated the death of Charles II of England in the long poem Threnodia Augustalis , and Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote a "Threnody" in memory of his son.
