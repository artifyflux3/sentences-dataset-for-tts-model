Cyprus has a rich flora and a diverse fauna albeit with relatively few mammals . Like most modern countries, the natural habitats in Cyprus have been steadily disappearing, currently retaining only 20% of its original habitat due to rapid urbanization , usage of forests for commercial purposes, tourism and various other reasons.

[ 1 ] One of the features of Cyprus' habitats is the wild and sharp differences in elevations and habitats on the island as well as climate, all of which supply a diverse habitat for an array of fauna and flora.

[ 2 ] Terra Cypria was established as a trust in 1992 to conserve the Cypriot environment and its biodiversity.

[ 3 ] Fauna [ edit ] Amphibians [ edit ] Main article: List of amphibians of Cyprus The fauna of Cyprus has four amphibians .

Birds [ edit ] Main article: List of birds of Cyprus Cyprus also has over 380 species of bird due to being on migration routes between Africa, Europe and western Asia including Eleonora's falcon ( Falco eleonorae ), flamingo and the imperial eagle ( Aquila heliaca ). There are two endemic species of songbirds, the Cyprus warbler ( Sylvia melanothorax ) and the Cyprus wheatear ( Oenanthe cypriaca ). Both only breed on the island of Cyprus and migrate south to overwinter.

[ 4 ] Mammals [ edit ] Main article: List of mammals of Cyprus Cyprus is currently home to 21 known mammals , of which three are endangered .

[ 5 ] The largest wild animal and mammal currently residing in Cyprus is the endemic Cypriot mouflon . Other notable mammals are the large endangered Mediterranean monk seal [ 6 ] and the endemic Cypriot mouse , which is the only remaining endemic rodent on the Mediterranean islands.

[ 7 ] During the Late Pleistocene , the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus , the Cyprus dwarf elephant and a species of genet ( Genetta plesictoides ) were also native to the island, but became extinct at the beginning of the Holocene , following the arrival of humans to Cyprus.

[ 8 ] Reptiles [ edit ] Main article: List of reptiles of Cyprus Most of the reptiles of Cyprus are harmless, and non-venomous such as the Cyprus whip snake ( Hierophis cypriensis ) and the European blind snake ( Typhlops vermicularis ) . Other snakes, European cat snake ( Telescopus fallax ) and Montpellier snake ( Malpolon monspessulanus ) are nominally venomous, but neither aggressive nor particularly dangerous. In contrast, the Cyprian blunt-nosed viper , ( Macrovipera lebetina lebetina ), though not aggressive, is a large, front-fanged viper . Its bite is dangerous even to large mammals, including people.

[ 9 ] Three of the reptile species on Cyprus, including Macrovipera lebetina , are endangered.

[ 5 ] Cyprus has several species of lizards and a few species of turtles such as loggerhead sea turtle ( Caretta caretta ).

Arachnids [ edit ] Cyprus has an especially wide array of arachnids with around 60 species of spiders, including the European tarantula ( Lycosa tarantula ).

[ 10 ] Insects [ edit ] Mt Olympus (Chionístra) harbours several endemic weevils , including Melanobaris troodi Stüben, 2024, Otiorhynchus crassicollis Stierlin, 1861, Psallidium chionistrae Alziar, 2006, and Strophomorphus exophthalmus Pelletier, 1999.

[ 11 ] Flora [ edit ] The flora of Cyprus contains about 1800 species, of which circa 128 are endemic.

[ 1 ] The flora also include invasive species such as prickly pears and the yellow oxalis .
