[ note 1 ] According to Aristotle, this is the first work to treat the subject of deductive reasoning in ancient Greece ( Soph. Ref.

, 34, 183b34 ff.).

Overview [ edit ] On Sophistical Refutations [ 1 ] [ 2 ] consists of 34 chapters. The book naturally falls in two parts: chapters concerned with tactics for the Questioner (3–8 and 12–15) and chapters concerned with tactics for the Answerer (16–32). Besides, there is an introduction (1–2), an interlude (9–11), and a conclusion (33–34).

[ 3 ] Fallacies identified [ edit ] The fallacies Aristotle identifies in Chapter 4 (formal fallacies) and 5 (informal fallacies) of this book are the following: Fallacies in the language or formal fallacies ( in dictionem ): Equivocation Amphiboly Composition Division Accent Figure of speech or form of expression Fallacies not in the language or informal fallacies ( extra dictionem ): Accident Secundum quid Irrelevant conclusion Petitio principii False cause Affirming the consequent Fallacy of many questions Footnotes [ edit ] ^ Sometimes listed as twelve.
