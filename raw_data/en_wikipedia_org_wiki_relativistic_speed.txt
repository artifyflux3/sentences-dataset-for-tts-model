Relativistic effects are those discrepancies between values calculated by models considering and not considering relativity .

[ 1 ] Related words are velocity , rapidity , and celerity which is proper velocity .

Speed is a scalar , being the magnitude of the velocity vector which in relativity is the four-velocity and in three-dimension Euclidean space a three-velocity. Speed is empirically measured as average speed, although current devices in common use can estimate speed over very small intervals and closely approximate instantaneous speed. Non-relativistic discrepancies include cosine error which occurs in speed detection devices when only one scalar component of the three-velocity is measured and the Doppler effect which may affect observations of wavelength and frequency.

Lorentz factor , γ, as a function of speed, v . Its initial value is 1 when speed is zero and increases without bound as speed approaches light speed, c .

Inverse of Lorentz factor as a function of speed, v , as a proportion of light speed, c - a circular arc.

Relativistic effects are highly non-linear and for everyday purposes are insignificant because the Newtonian model closely approximates the relativity model. In special relativity the Lorentz factor is a measure of time dilation , length contraction and the relativistic mass increase of a moving object.
