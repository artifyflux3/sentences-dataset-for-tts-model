Early life and education [ edit ] Skerry was born in Milford, Massachusetts in 1961, and grew up in Uxbridge .

[ 1 ] Skerry began SCUBA diving in 1977, at 15 years old and received his first SCUBA certification in 1978. He has stated that he was drawn to the water from a very young age and was always fascinated by ocean documentaries, along with the movies Jaws (1975) and The Deep (1977) [ 2 ] After studying at Quinsigamond Community College , where he earned an associate degree in Liberal Arts , [ 3 ] he went on to Worcester State College earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Communications Media in 1984.

In a 2021 article in The Maine Magazine , Skerry recalls Bill Curtsinger , one of the first underwater photographers, turning down a National Geographic magazine photo shoot of the 1717 pirate shipwreck Whydah Gally , buried in the sand off Cape Cod . Curtsinger turned down the job due to a scheduling conflict but put in a good word for Skerry, who in turn, took the story assignment.

[ 11 ] Skerry had his photos published in the May 1999 edition of National Geographic .

[ 12 ] Skerry has been credited with more than 30 stories for National Geographic , [ 13 ] including seven on the front cover of the magazine.

a The subjects of his stories have included species such as harp seals , [ 14 ] squid , [ 15 ] right whales , [ 16 ] Leatherback sea turtles , [ 17 ] bluefin tuna , [ 18 ] dolphins [ 19 ] and coral reefs .

[ 20 ] Other stories have featured locations such as the Southern Line Islands , [ 21 ] Ireland , [ 22 ] Marine reserves of New Zealand , [ 23 ] the Phoenix Islands , [ 24 ] Japan , [ 25 ] the Mesoamerican Reef , [ 26 ] and in his home state , the Gulf of Maine .

[ 11 ] In 2016 National Geographic published three consecutive stories photographed by Skerry about sharks.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] While on assignment for National Geographic on September 1, 2016, he photographed U.S. President Barack Obama snorkeling in the waters off Midway Atoll in the Pacific Ocean , which lies within the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument .

[ 30 ] It was the first photograph ever taken of a President of the United States underwater.

[ 31 ] Secrets of the Whales [ edit ] Orca , a whale featured in the miniseries co-produced by Skerry, Secrets of the Whales .

Main article: Secrets of the Whales Secrets of the Whales was a multi-platform project Skerry created for National Geographic in 2017 about the science of whale culture. He credits the work of Canadian whale biologist Shane Gero as his inspiration for this project.

[ 32 ] Skerry proposed the project to National Geographic magazine, National Geographic Television and National Geographic Books and each division approved their respective project.

[ 33 ] The cover story in National Geographic magazine appeared in the May 2021 issue, written by Craig Welch and photographed by Skerry.

[ 40 ] First Underwater photo of a Great White in Maine [ edit ] On July 8, 2025, while on assignment for National Geographic, Skerry captured what is believed to be the first-ever underwater photograph of a Great white shark off the coast of Maine. About 15 miles from Harpswell , in the Gulf of Maine , Skerry came face-to-face with a curious juvenile female roughly 10 feet long. “She moved… within maybe four feet of me,” he recalled, managing to slide into the water and frame the iconic shot before the shark quietly vanished after a three‑minute encounter. After more than 10,000 hours spent exploring marine life beneath the waves, this shot marked a milestone not just for Skerry but for marine science in Maine, offering fresh underwater evidence of great white presence that until now had only been hinted at by tagged individuals and surface sightings.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] PBS [ edit ] Sea Change: The Gulf of Maine [ edit ] Main article: Sea Change: The Gulf of Maine Sea Change: The Gulf of Maine is a 3-Part, PBS NOVA special, documentary television series produced by Brian Skerry, Chun-Wei Yi and Stella Cha that debuted in July 2024.

Focused on the Gulf of Maine, the Gulf of Maine is a 36,000 square mile body of water stretching from Cape Cod , Massachusetts to Nova Scotia , Canada that is warming 97% faster than the rest of the global ocean.

Sea Change blends science, exploration, stunning natural history, and stories of human experience, to illuminate how what happens here could have profound global implications. Viewers will encounter the spectacular wilderness and wildlife that still teems in these waters. The series also documents the range of people including scientists, Native Americans, fishers, and entrepreneurs working to reveal the Gulf’s complex history and helping to understand what role the ocean plays in all of our lives. It is a regional story with global implications.

Conservation [ edit ] In 2012 Skerry partnered with the Conservation Law Foundation in Boston to create The New England Ocean Odyssey .

[ 43 ] Skerry lectures on issues of visual storytelling and ocean conservation and exploration, having presented at venues including The United Nations General Assembly , [ 44 ] The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland , TED Talks , The National Press Club in Washington, DC, The Royal Geographical Society in London and the Sydney Opera House in Australia .

[ 44 ] He's been a guest on several television programs including CBS This Morning , [ 45 ] Nightline , [ 46 ] Anderson Cooper Full Circle [ 47 ] and is a frequent guest on radio shows and podcasts .

[ 48 ] Skerry is a Founding Fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers, [ 49 ] and the Explorer-In-Residence at the New England Aquarium .

[ 50 ] Awards and recognition [ edit ] At the end of five hours in the cold water... I had this one chance and one frame and that one instant. I was ready. It came down to one second. That is the beauty of photography. It's a moment in time and it vanishes like a ghost but if you have a photo, you have it forever.
