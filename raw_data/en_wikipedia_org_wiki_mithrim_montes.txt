The range is located near Titan's equator , between 1–3° south and 126–8° west [ 1 ] and consists of three parallel ridges that are oriented east–west, spaced about 25 km apart.

[ 2 ] They are located within the region Xanadu .

[ 3 ] The highest peak is about 3,337 m (10,948 ft) high and is located on the southernmost of the ridges; it is the highest known peak on Titan.

[ 2 ] The Mithrim Montes are named after the Mithrim Mountains , a range in J. R. R. Tolkien 's fictional world of Middle-earth .

[ 1 ] This follows a convention that Titanean mountains are named after mountains in Tolkien's work.

[ 4 ] The name was formally announced on November 13, 2012.
