**Mechanism** is the belief that natural wholes (principally living things) are similar to complicated machines or artifacts, composed of parts lacking any intrinsic relationship to each other.

The doctrine of mechanism in [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") comes in two different varieties. They are both doctrines of [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"), but they are different in scope and ambitions: the first is a global doctrine about nature; the second is a local doctrine about humans and their minds, which is hotly contested. For clarity, we might distinguish these two doctrines as [universal mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#Universal_mechanism) and [anthropic mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#Anthropic_mechanism).

Mechanical philosophy
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mechanism_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Mechanical philosophy")]

Mechanical philosophy is a form of [natural philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy "Natural philosophy") which compares the universe to a large-scale mechanism (i.e. a [machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine "Machine")). Mechanical philosophy is associated with the [Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution") of early modern [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"). One of the first expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of _[Leviathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan\_(Hobbes\_book) "Leviathan (Hobbes book)")_ by [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes "Thomas Hobbes"), published in 1651.

Some [intellectual historians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_history "Intellectual history") and [critical theorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory "Critical theory") argue that early mechanical philosophy was tied to [disenchantment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenchantment "Disenchantment") and the rejection of the idea of nature as living or animated by spirits or [angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels "Angels").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-1) Other scholars, however, have noted that early mechanical philosophers nevertheless believed in [magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural) "Magic (supernatural)"), [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") and [spiritualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritualism_(beliefs) "Spiritualism (beliefs)").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-2)

### Mechanism and determinism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mechanism_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Mechanism and determinism")]

Some ancient philosophies held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") and collision of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"). This view was closely linked with [materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism "Materialism") and [reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism "Reductionism"), especially that of the [atomists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism") and to a large extent, [stoic physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoic_physics "Stoic physics"). Later mechanists believed the achievements of the scientific revolution of the 17th century had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of "mechanical laws": natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that imply a [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism "Determinism"). If all phenomena can be explained entirely through the motion of matter under physical laws, as the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, all phenomena must be completely determined, past, present or future.

The natural philosophers concerned with developing the mechanical philosophy were largely a French group, together with some of their personal connections. They included [Pierre Gassendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gassendi "Pierre Gassendi"), [Marin Mersenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Mersenne "Marin Mersenne") and [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"). Also involved were the English thinkers [Sir Kenelm Digby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Kenelm_Digby "Sir Kenelm Digby"), [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes "Thomas Hobbes") and [Walter Charleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Charleton "Walter Charleton"); and the Dutch natural philosopher [Isaac Beeckman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Beeckman "Isaac Beeckman").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-3)

[Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle "Robert Boyle") used "mechanical philosophers" to refer both to those with a theory of "corpuscles" or [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") of matter, such as Gassendi and Descartes, and those who did without such a theory. One common factor was the [clockwork universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwork_universe "Clockwork universe") view. His meaning would be problematic in the cases of Hobbes and [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei"); it would include [Nicolas Lemery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Lemery "Nicolas Lemery") and [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens"), as well as himself. Newton would be a transitional figure. Contemporary usage of "mechanical philosophy" dates back to 1952 and [Marie Boas Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Boas_Hall "Marie Boas Hall").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-4)

In France the mechanical philosophy spread mostly through private academies and salons; in England in the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society"). In England it did not have a large initial impact in universities, which were somewhat more receptive in France, the Netherlands and Germany.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-5)

One of the first expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of _[Leviathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan\_(Hobbes\_book) "Leviathan (Hobbes book)")_ (1651) by Hobbes; the book's second chapter invokes the [principle of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_inertia "Principle of inertia"), foundational for the mechanical philosophy.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-6) Boyle did not mention him as one of the group; but at the time they were on opposite sides of a controversy. [Richard Westfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Westfall "Richard Westfall") deems him a mechanical philosopher.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-7)

Hobbes's major statement of his natural philosophy is in _[De Corpore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Corpore "De Corpore")_ (1655).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-8) In part II and III of this work he goes a long way towards identifying fundamental [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") with [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"); and he freely mixes concepts from the two areas.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-9)

Descartes was also a mechanist. A [substance dualist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dualist "Substance dualist"), he argued that reality is composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), on the one hand, and immaterial [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind"), on the other. He identified matter with the spatial extension which is its only clear and distinct idea, and consequently denied the existence of [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-10) Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was mechanistic in nature:

"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels." (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p. 108.)
His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding which maintains that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton "Automaton"). Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

Isaac Beeckman's theory of mechanical philosophy described in his books _Centuria_ and _Journal_ is grounded in two components: matter and motion. To explain matter, Beeckman relied on a philosophy of atomism which explains that matter is composed of tiny inseparable particles that interact to create the objects seen in life. To explain motion, he supported the idea of inertia, a theory generated by Isaac Newton.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-11)

[Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") ushered in a weaker notion of mechanism that tolerated the [action at a distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance "Action at a distance") of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"). Interpretations of Newton's scientific work in light of [his occult research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_occult_studies "Isaac Newton's occult studies") have suggested that he did not properly view the universe as mechanistic, but instead populated by mysterious forces and spirits and constantly sustained by God and angels.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-12) Later generations of philosophers who were influenced by Newton's example were nonetheless often mechanists. Among them were [Julien Offray de La Mettrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Offray_de_La_Mettrie "Julien Offray de La Mettrie") and [Denis Diderot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Diderot "Denis Diderot").

The French mechanist and determinist [Pierre Simon de Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Simon_de_Laplace "Pierre Simon de Laplace") formulated some implications of the mechanist thesis, writing:

> We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom"); for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.

Critics argue that although mechanical philosophy includes a wide range of useful observational and principled data,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-13) it has not adequately explained the world and its components, and there are weaknesses in its definitions.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-tnfm2-14) Among the criticisms made of this philosophy are:

*   Experts in religious studies have criticized the philosophy that God's intervention in the management of the world seems unnecessary.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-tnfm1-16)
*   Newton's mechanical philosophy, with all its positive effects on human life, ultimately leads to [Deism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism "Deism").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-17)
*   It is a stagnant worldview that cannot explain God's constant presence and favor in the world.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-18)
*   At the height of this philosophy, God was viewed as a skilled designer, and for him the mental structure and human morality were conceived.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-19)
*   The assumption that God tuned the world like a clock and left it to its own devices is in clear conflict with the God of the Bible, who is at all times directly and immediately involved in his creation.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-20)
*   This philosophy abandons concepts such as [essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence "Essence"), [accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_(philosophy) "Accident (philosophy)"), [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylomorphism#Matter_and_form "Hylomorphism"), [form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylomorphism#Matter_and_form "Hylomorphism"), [act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_actuality "Potentiality and actuality") and [potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential "Potential") that are used in [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology "Ontology"), and denies the involvement of transcendental affairs in the management of this world.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-ttqwe3-21)
*   This philosophy is generally incapable of explaining human spiritual experiences and the immaterial realms of the world.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-ttqwe3-21)
*   The mechanistic philosophy arbitrarily bifurcates the natural world into groupings of _[causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal "Causal")_ and _effects,_ which follow the dictates of _[forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forces "Forces")_ and _[active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic\_activity "Thermodynamic activity")[principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles "Principles")_ which are ascribed as [objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity_and_objectivity_(philosophy) "Subjectivity and objectivity (philosophy)") universalities within the natural world [anthropomorphically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphically "Anthropomorphically").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-22)

Universal mechanism
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mechanism_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Universal mechanism")]

The older doctrine, here called **universal mechanism**, is the ancient philosophies closely linked with [materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism "Materialism") and [reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism "Reductionism"), especially that of the [atomists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism") and to a large extent, [stoic physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism "Stoicism"). They held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") and collision of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"). Later mechanists believed the achievements of the [Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution") had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of 'mechanical' laws, natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that implied a thorough going [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism "Determinism"): if _all_ phenomena could be explained _entirely_ through the motion of matter under the laws of [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics"), then even more surely than the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, _all_ phenomena must be completely determined: whether past, present or future.

The French mechanist and determinist [Pierre Simon de Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Simon_de_Laplace "Pierre Simon de Laplace") formulated the sweeping implications of this thesis by saying:

> We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom"); for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.

— Pierre Simon Laplace, _A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities_

One of the first and most famous expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of _[Leviathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan\_(Hobbes\_book) "Leviathan (Hobbes book)")_ by [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes "Thomas Hobbes") (1651). What is less frequently appreciated is that [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") was a staunch mechanist, though today, in the [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind "Philosophy of mind"), he is remembered for introducing the [mind–body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem "Mind–body problem") in terms of [dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind-body_dualism "Mind-body dualism") and [physicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism "Physicalism").

Descartes was a [substance dualist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dualist "Substance dualist"), and argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), on the one hand, and immaterial [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind"), on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was thoroughly mechanistic in nature:

> I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels.

— René Descartes, _Treatise on Man,_ p.108

His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton "Automaton"). Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

[Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") ushered in a much weaker acceptation of mechanism that tolerated the antithetical, and as yet inexplicable, [action at a distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance "Action at a distance") of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"). However, his work seemed to successfully predict the motion of both celestial and terrestrial bodies according to that principle, and the generation of philosophers who were inspired by Newton's example carried the mechanist banner nonetheless. Chief among them were French [philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") such as [Julien Offray de La Mettrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Offray_de_La_Mettrie "Julien Offray de La Mettrie") and [Denis Diderot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Diderot "Denis Diderot") (see also: [French materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_materialism "French materialism")).

Anthropic mechanism
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mechanism_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Anthropic mechanism")]

The thesis in **anthropic mechanism** is not that everything can be completely explained in mechanical terms (although some anthropic mechanists may also believe that), but rather that everything _about human beings_ can be completely explained in mechanical terms, as surely as can everything about clocks or the internal combustion engine.

One of the chief obstacles that all mechanistic theories have faced is providing a mechanistic explanation of the human [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind"); [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes"), for one, endorsed [dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind) "Dualism (philosophy of mind)") in spite of endorsing a completely mechanistic conception of the material world because he argued that mechanism and the notion of a [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind") are logically incompatible. [Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbes "Hobbes"), on the other hand, conceived of the mind and the will as purely mechanistic, completely explicable in terms of the effects of perception and the pursuit of desire, which in turn he held to be completely explicable in terms of the materialistic operations of the nervous system. Following Hobbes, other mechanists argued for a thoroughly mechanistic explanation of the mind, with one of the most influential and controversial expositions of the doctrine being offered by [Julien Offray de La Mettrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Offray_de_La_Mettrie "Julien Offray de La Mettrie") in his _Man a Machine_ (1748).

The main points of debate between anthropic mechanists and anti-mechanists are mainly occupied with two topics: the mind—consciousness, in particular—and [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will "Free will"). Anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism is incompatible with our commonsense intuitions: in [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind "Philosophy of mind") they argue that if matter is devoid of mental properties, then the phenomenon of consciousness cannot be explained by mechanistic principles acting on matter. In [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"), anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism implies determinism about human action, which is incompatible with our experience of [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will "Free will"). Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this position include [Norman Malcolm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Malcolm "Norman Malcolm") and [David Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers "David Chalmers").

Anthropic mechanists typically respond in one of two ways. In the first, they agree with anti-mechanists that mechanism conflicts with some of our commonsense intuitions, but go on to argue that said intuitions are simply mistaken and need to be revised. Down this path lies [eliminative materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliminative_materialism "Eliminative materialism") in [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind "Philosophy of mind"), and [hard determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_determinism "Hard determinism") on the question of free will. This option is accepted by the eliminative materialist philosopher [Paul Churchland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Churchland "Paul Churchland"). Some have questioned how eliminative materialism is compatible with the freedom of will apparently required for anyone (including its adherents) to make truth claims.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-23) The second option, common amongst philosophers who adopt anthropic mechanism, is to argue that the [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument "Argument") given for incompatibility are specious: whatever it is we mean by "consciousness" and "free will" must be fully compatible with a mechanistic understanding of the human mind and will. As a result, they tend to argue for one or another non-eliminativist [physicalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism "Physicalism") theory of mind, and for [compatibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism "Compatibilism") on the question of free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this sort of account include [J. J. C. Smart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._C._Smart "J. J. C. Smart") and [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett "Daniel Dennett").

Some scholars have debated over what, if anything, [Gödel's incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems "Gödel's incompleteness theorems") imply about anthropic mechanism. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine "Turing machine"), or by the [Church-Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church-Turing_thesis "Church-Turing thesis"), any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is [consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency "Consistency"), then Gödel's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.

**Gödelian arguments** claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent and powerful enough to recognize its own consistency. Since this is impossible for a Turing machine, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning must be non-mechanical.

However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent: any consistent "idealized version" _H_ of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of _H_ (otherwise _H_ is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel's theorems do not lead to any valid argument against mechanism.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-26) This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in _[Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\_Intelligence\_(journal) "Artificial Intelligence (journal)")_: "_any_ attempt to utilize [Gödel's incompleteness results] to attack the [computationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computationalism "Computationalism") thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis."[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-laforte-27)

One of the earliest attempts to use incompleteness to reason about human intelligence was by Gödel himself in his 1951 [Gibbs Lecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs_Lectureship "Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectureship") entitled "Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their philosophical implications".[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-28) In this lecture, Gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [Diophantine equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equations "Diophantine equations") for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a "certain fact".

In subsequent years, more direct anti-mechanist lines of reasoning were apparently floating around the intellectual atmosphere. In 1960, [Hilary Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Putnam "Hilary Putnam") published a paper entitled "Minds and Machines," in which he points out the flaws of a typical anti-mechanist argument.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-29) Informally, this is the argument that the (alleged) difference between "what can be mechanically proven" and "what can be seen to be true by humans" shows that human intelligence is not mechanical in nature. Or, as Putnam puts it:

> Let T be a Turing machine which "represents" me in the sense that T can prove just the mathematical statements I prove. Then using Gödel's technique I can discover a proposition that T cannot prove, and moreover I can prove this proposition. This refutes the assumption that T "represents" me, hence I am not a Turing machine.

[Hilary Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Putnam "Hilary Putnam") objects that this argument ignores the issue of consistency. Gödel's technique can only be applied to consistent systems. It is conceivable, argues Putnam, that the human mind is inconsistent. If one is to use Gödel's technique to prove the proposition that T cannot prove, one must first prove (the mathematical statement representing) the consistency of T, a daunting and perhaps impossible task. Later Putnam suggested that while Gödel's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. If we are to believe that it is consistent, then either we cannot prove its consistency, or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-30)

[J. R. Lucas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Lucas "J. R. Lucas") in _[Minds, Machines and Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minds,\_Machines\_and\_G%C3%B6del "Minds, Machines and Gödel")_ (1961), and later in his book _The Freedom of the Will_ (1970), lays out an anti-mechanist argument closely following the one described by Putnam, including reasons for why the human mind can be considered consistent.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-31) Lucas admits that, by Gödel's second theorem, a human mind cannot formally prove its own consistency, and even says (perhaps facetiously) that women and politicians are inconsistent. Nevertheless, he sets out arguments for why a male non-politician can be considered consistent.

Another work was done by Judson Webb in his 1968 paper "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind".[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-32) Webb claims that previous attempts have glossed over whether one truly can see that the Gödelian statement _p_ pertaining to oneself, is true. Using a different formulation of Gödel's theorems, namely, that of [Raymond Smullyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Smullyan "Raymond Smullyan") and [Emil Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Post "Emil Post"), Webb shows one can derive convincing arguments for oneself of both the truth and falsity of _p_. He furthermore argues that all arguments about the philosophical implications of Gödel's theorems are really arguments about whether the [Church-Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church-Turing_thesis "Church-Turing thesis") is true.

In 1975, [Lewis White Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_White_Beck "Lewis White Beck") further argued that _all_ attempts which have been made thus far to _prove_ that mankind is merely "a cog in the machinery of the world" are futile at best and fundamentally _irrational_ in nature. In his book _The Actor and the Spectator_ he avoids the temptation to present an alternative rational argument in support of the mechanistic theory. Instead, he argues that the theory by its very nature is "self-stulifying" and should be accompanied by a "self-exemption clause". This is due to the fact that if mechanistic theories are objectively true, mankind could never acquire knowledge of them or even establish their veracity. This is due to the fact that machines lack the capacity of human imagination by their very nature and are, as a consequence, totally incapable of formulating such a theory in the first place. As Beck patiently reminds his readers, "If you believe that _you_ are not a machine, but that _I am_ (then) I do not know why you are reading this book".[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-34)

Later, [Roger Penrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose "Roger Penrose") entered the fray, providing somewhat novel anti-mechanist arguments in his books, _[The Emperor's New Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Emperor%27s\_New\_Mind "The Emperor's New Mind")_ (1989) [ENM] and _[Shadows of the Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows\_of\_the\_Mind "Shadows of the Mind")_ (1994) [SM]. These books have proved highly controversial. [Martin Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Davis_(mathematician) "Martin Davis (mathematician)") responded to ENM in his paper ["Is Mathematical Insight Algorithmic?" (ps)](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/davism/penrose.ps), where he argues that Penrose ignores the issue of consistency. [Solomon Feferman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Feferman "Solomon Feferman") gives a critical examination of SM in his paper "Penrose's Gödelian argument."[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-35) The response of the scientific community to Penrose's arguments has been negative, with one group of scholars calling Penrose's repeated attempts to form a persuasive Gödelian argument "a kind of intellectual shell game, in which a precisely defined notion to which a mathematical result applies ... is switched for a vaguer notion".[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-laforte-27)

A Gödel-based anti-mechanism argument can be found in [Douglas Hofstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter "Douglas Hofstadter")'s book _[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,\_Escher,\_Bach:\_An\_Eternal\_Golden\_Braid "Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid")_, though Hofstadter is widely viewed as a known skeptic of such arguments:

> Looked at this way, Gödel's proof suggests – though by no means does it prove! – that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mind/brain, involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level might have explanatory power that does not exist – not even in principle – on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be explained on the high level quite easily, but not on lower levels at all. No matter how long and cumbersome a low-level statement were made, it would not explain the phenomena in question. It is analogous to the fact that, if you make derivation after derivation in [Peano arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_arithmetic "Peano arithmetic"), no matter how long and cumbersome you make them, you will never come up with one for G – despite the fact that on a higher level, you can see that the [Gödel sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_sentence "Gödel sentence") is true.
> 
> 
> What might such high-level concepts be? It has been proposed for eons, by various holistically or "soulistically" inclined scientists and humanists that consciousness is a phenomenon that escapes explanation in terms of brain components; so here is a candidate at least. There is also the ever-puzzling notion of free will. So perhaps these qualities could be "emergent" in the sense of requiring explanations which cannot be furnished by the physiology alone.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)#cite_note-36)
