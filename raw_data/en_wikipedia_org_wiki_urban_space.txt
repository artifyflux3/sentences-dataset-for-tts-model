An **urban area**[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-2) is a [human settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_settlement "Human settlement") with a high [population density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density "Population density") and an [infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure "Infrastructure") of [built environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built_environment "Built environment"). Urban areas originate through [urbanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization "Urbanization"), and researchers categorize them as cities, towns, [conurbations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conurbation "Conurbation") or [suburbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburbs "Suburbs"). In [urbanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanism "Urbanism"), the term "urban area" contrasts to [rural areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area "Rural area") such as [villages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village "Village") and [hamlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_(place) "Hamlet (place)"); in [urban sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sociology "Urban sociology") or [urban anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_anthropology "Urban anthropology"), it often contrasts with [natural environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment "Natural environment").

Earth's land use in 2019, built-up area being estimated as 1.5 million square kilometers.

In 1950, 764 million people (or about 30 percent of the world's 2.5 billion people) lived in urban areas. In 2009, the number of people living in urban areas (3.42 billion) surpassed the number living in rural areas (3.41 billion), and since then the world has become more urban than rural.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-4) By 2014, it was 3.9 billion (or about 53 percent of the world's 7.3 billion people) that lived in urban areas. The change was driven by a combination of increased total population and increased percent of population living in urban areas.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-UrbanPopulation-5)This was the first time that the majority of the world's population lived in a city.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-6) By that time a high estimate calculated up to 3.5 million square kilometers of land were urban, estimates ranging from 1% of global land area.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-c171-7)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-r019-8) In 2014 there were 7.3 billion people living on the planet,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-WorldPopulation-9) of which the global urban population comprised 3.9 billion. The Population Division of the [United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Department_of_Economic_and_Social_Affairs "United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs") at that time predicted the urban population would occupy 68% of the world population by 2050, with 90% of that growth coming from Africa and Asia.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-10)

Urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2020

Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization. They are measured for various purposes, including analyzing [population density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density "Population density") and [urban sprawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sprawl "Urban sprawl"). Urban areas are generally found in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"), [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina"), [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile"), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan"), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"), and many other countries where the urbanization rate is high.

Unlike an urban area, a [metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area "Metropolitan area") includes not only the urban area, but also [satellite cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_city "Satellite city") plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the [urban core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_core "Urban core") city, typically by [employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment "Employment") ties through [commuting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting "Commuting"), with the urban core city being the primary labor market.

The concept of an "urban area" as used in economic statistics should not be confused with the concept of the "urban area" used in road safety statistics. This term was first created by Geographer Brian Manning. The last concept is also known as "[built-up area in road safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built-up_area_(Highway_Code) "Built-up area (Highway Code)")". According to the definition by the [Office for National Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics "Office for National Statistics"), "Built-up areas are defined as land which is 'irreversibly urban in character', meaning that they are characteristic of a town or city. They include areas of built-up land with a minimum of 20 hectares (200,000 m 2; 49 acres). Any areas [separated by] less than 200 metres [of non-urban space] are linked to become a single built-up area.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-12)

Argentina and Japan are countries where the urbanization rate is over 90% while Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and the United States are countries where the urbanization rate is between 80% and 90%, although within the [U.S. state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state "U.S. state") of [New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey "New Jersey"), the urbanization rate is 100%.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-13)

Largest urban areas
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Urban_area&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Largest urban areas")]

There are two measures of the degree of urbanization of a population. The first, urban population, describes the percentage of the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the country. The second measure, rate of urbanization, describes the projected average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the given period of time. According to [Urbanization by sovereign state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_by_sovereign_state "Urbanization by sovereign state") article, the world as a whole is 56.2% urbanized, with roughly one-quarter of the countries reported as greater than 80% urbanized. Data is taken from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook estimates from 2020.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-14)

According to Demographia, these are the 200 largest urban areas in the world by population (as of 2023):[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-15)

Presently, urban data are based on arbitrary definitions that vary from country to country and from year or census to the next, making them difficult to compare.

An Urban Metric System (UMS) has been conceived that could correct the problem,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-16) since it allows computing the urban area limits and central points, and it can be applied in the same way to all past, present and future population and job distributions. It is based on vector field calculations obtained by assuming that, in a given space, all inhabitants and jobs exert the same attractive force _A_ and repulsive force _R_. The net force (_A_ - _R_) exerted by each inhabitant or job is given by [1/(1 + _d_)] - [1/( _β_ + _d_/2)], where _d_ = distance and _β_ is the only parameter.

UMS distinguishes the following types of urban areas, each type corresponding to a given value of _β_:

|  | Urban area | Distance at which the attractive force = the repulsive force | Value of _β_ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Central city | 10 km | 6 |
| 2 | Agglomeration | 20 km | 11 |
| 3 | Metropolis | 40 km | 21 |
| 4 | Patropolis | 80 km | 41 |
| 5 | Megalopolis | 160 km | 81 |
| 6 | Urban system | 320 km | 161 |
| 7 | Urban macrosystem | 640 km | 321 |
| 8 | Continental system | 1,280 km | 641 |
| 9 | Intercontinental system | 2,560 km | 1,281 |
| 10 | World system | 5,120 km | 2,561 |

UMS has been applied to some Canadian cases since 2018, but the data presented in this article are still based on the various existing national definitions, which are disparate.

> The UN publishes data on cities, urban areas and rural areas, but relies almost entirely on national definitions of these areas. The UN principles and recommendations state that due to different characteristics of urban and rural areas across the globe, a global definition is not possible.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-17)

[European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") countries[_[which?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid\_weasel\_words "Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words")_] define urbanized areas on the basis of urban-type [land use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use "Land use"), not allowing any gaps of typically more than 200 metres (220 yd), and use [satellite imagery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_imagery "Satellite imagery") instead of census blocks to determine the boundaries of the urban area. In less-developed countries[_[which?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid\_weasel\_words "Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words")_], in addition to land use and density requirements, a requirement that a large majority of the population, typically 75%, is not engaged in agriculture and/or fishing is sometimes used.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Since 2000, [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China")'s cities have expanded at an average rate of 10% annually. It is estimated that China's urban population will increase by 292 million people by 2050,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-UrbanPopulation-5) when its cities will house a combined population of over one billion.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-McKinseyUrbanBillion-18) The country's urbanization rate increased from 17.4% to 46.6% between 1978 and 2009.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-Ref_abcd-19) Between 150 and 200 million [migrant workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_worker "Migrant worker") work part-time in the major cities, returning home to the countryside periodically with their earnings.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-Harney2008-20)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-Tschang2009-21)

China has more cities with one million or more long-term residents than any other country, including the three [global cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city "Global city") of [Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing "Beijing"), Hong Kong, and [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai "Shanghai"); by 2025, the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-McKinseyUrbanBillion-18) The figures in the table below are from the 2008 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large "[floating populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_population "Floating population")" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-Ref_abce-22) the figures below include only long-term residents.

In [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan"), an area is a major [city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City "City") and [municipality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality "Municipality") if it has more than 100,000 inhabitants according to census results. Cities include adjacent [cantonments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonments_(Pakistan) "Cantonments (Pakistan)"). Urbanisation in [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan") has increased since the time of independence and has several different causes. The majority of southern Pakistan's population lives along the [Indus River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_River "Indus River"). Karachi is its most populous city.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-34) In the northern half of the country, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of [Lahore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore "Lahore"), [Faisalabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisalabad "Faisalabad"), [Rawalpindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi "Rawalpindi"), [Islamabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad "Islamabad"), [Gujranwala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujranwala "Gujranwala"), [Sialkot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialkot "Sialkot"), [Gujrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujrat_city "Gujrat city"), [Jhelum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhelum "Jhelum"), [Sargodha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargodha "Sargodha"), [Sheikhupura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikhupura "Sheikhupura"), [Nowshera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowshera,_Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa "Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa"), [Mardan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardan "Mardan") and [Peshawar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar "Peshawar"). During 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-35) Karachi is the most populated city in Pakistan closely followed by Lahore according to the [2017 Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Census_of_Pakistan "2017 Census of Pakistan").

In 2020, 54 percent of the Philippine population lived in urban areas.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-36) With an estimated population of 16.3 million, [Metro Manila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Manila "Metro Manila") is the most populous metropolitan area in the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_in_the_Philippines "List of metropolitan areas in the Philippines") and the [11th in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_by_population "List of metropolitan areas by population"). However, the greater urban area is the [5th largest in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_by_population "List of urban areas by population") with a population of 20,654,307 people (2010 estimate).[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-WG-37)

As an island [city-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state "City-state"), about 5.6 million people live and work within 700 square kilometres (270 sq mi). With 64 [islands and islets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_of_Singapore "List of islands of Singapore"), [Singapore Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Island "Singapore Island") makes up the largest urban area in the country. According to the [United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Commission_for_Asia_and_the_Pacific "United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific"), the country has the highest urbanised population in Southeast Asia, with 100 percent of its population living in an urban area.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-38) The [Urban Redevelopment Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority "Urban Redevelopment Authority") (URA) is responsible for the urban [land-use planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-use_planning "Land-use planning"), which designates land use and [urban density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_density "Urban density") of the country.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-39) The country is divided into 5 [regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Singapore "Regions of Singapore") for planning purposes by the URA, even though as a city state Singapore is defined as a single continuous urban area. It is further subdivided into 55 [urban planning areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore "Planning Areas of Singapore"), which acts as the boundaries of [planned towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_towns_of_Singapore "New towns of Singapore") within the country.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-40)

[Bangkok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok "Bangkok") is the largest urban area in [Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand "Thailand").

In [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam "Vietnam"), there are six types of urban areas:

A street sign in [Vimpeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimpeli "Vimpeli") indicating the beginning of an urban area in Finland

[As in other Nordic countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_areas_in_the_Nordic_countries "Urban areas in the Nordic countries"), an urban area (_taajama_ in [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language "Finnish language")) in Finland must have a building at least every 200 m (660 ft) and at least 200 people. To be considered a [town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town "Town") or a [city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City "City") (_kaupunki_) for statistical purposes, an urban area must have at least 15,000 people. This is not to be confused with the city / town designation used by [municipalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalities_of_Finland "Municipalities of Finland").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-41)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-42)

In [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), an urban area (_Fr: [aire d'attraction d'une ville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aire\_d%27attraction\_d%27une\_ville "Aire d'attraction d'une ville")_) is a zone encompassing an area of built-up growth (called an "urban unit" (_[unité urbaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit%C3%A9\_urbaine "Unité urbaine")_)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-unit%C3%A9_urbaine-43) – close in definition to the North American urban area) and its commuter belt (_[couronne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couronne\_p%C3%A9riurbaine "Couronne périurbaine")_). Americans would find the [INSEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INSEE "INSEE") definition of the urban area[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-aire_urbaine-44) to be similar to their [metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area "Metropolitan area").

[Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway "Norway") defines urban areas ("tettsteder") [similarly to the other Nordic countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_areas_in_the_Nordic_countries "Urban areas in the Nordic countries"). Unlike in Denmark and Sweden, the distance between each building has to be of less than 50 m, although exceptions are made due to parks, industrial areas, rivers, and similar. Groups of houses less than 400 m from the main body of an urban area are included in the urban area.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-ssb1-47)

In [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland"), official "urban" population figures simply refer to those localities which have the status of towns (_miasta_). The "rural" population is that of all areas outside the boundaries of these towns. This distinction may give a misleading impression in some cases, since some localities with only village status may have acquired larger and denser populations than many many smaller towns[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-48) with most excessive example of [Poznań](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pozna%C5%84 "Poznań"), most spread urban area of the country with population of the city app. 534 thousand and [metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pozna%C5%84_metropolitan_area "Poznań metropolitan area") around 1 million inhabitants. On the other hand, the [Katowice urban area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katowice_urban_area "Katowice urban area") with numerous large and medium cities covers 1,468 km and has above 2 million people. The [metropolitan areas in Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_areas_in_Poland "Metropolitan areas in Poland") are the biggest urban zones (e.g. [Katowice metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katowice_metropolitan_area "Katowice metropolitan area"), [Łódź metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_metropolitan_area "Łódź metropolitan area") and [Szczecin metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szczecin_metropolitan_area "Szczecin metropolitan area")) and have great impact on the rural surroundings, as it is around [Lublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lublin "Lublin"), [Radom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radom "Radom"), [Kielce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kielce "Kielce"), [Tarnów](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarn%C3%B3w "Tarnów") and [Białystok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia%C5%82ystok "Białystok").

[Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain") is a very highly urbanized country. [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid "Madrid") is its largest urban area. The Southern and Eastern coasts with [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona "Barcelona"), [Valencia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia "Valencia") and [Málaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1laga "Málaga") are more urbanised than the Northern and Western ones.

[Urban areas in Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_areas_in_Sweden "Urban areas in Sweden") (_tätorter_) are statistically defined localities, totally independent of the administrative subdivision of the country. There are 1,956 such localities in [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden"), with a population ranging from 200 to 1,372,000 inhabitants.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-55)

In 2013 the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom")'s [Office for National Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics "Office for National Statistics") (ONS) published _2011 Built-up Areas – Methodology and Guidance_ which sets out its definition of a **Built-up area** (BUA) as an area of built-up land of at least 20 hectares (0.077 sq mi), separated from other settlements by at least 200 metres (660 ft). For 2011 census data there are 5,493 built-up areas, of which 501 are divided into **Built-up area sub-divisions** (BUASD) for which data is also available. Each built-up area is named algorithmically, using Ordnance Survey place-name data.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-ons-56)

The ONS has produced census results from urban areas since 1951, since 1981 based upon the extent of irreversible urban development indicated on [Ordnance Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey "Ordnance Survey") maps. The definition is an extent of at least 20 ha and at least 1,500 census residents. Separate areas are linked if less than 200 m (220 yd) apart. Included are transportation features.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-57) The UK has five Urban Areas with a population over a million and a further sixty nine with a [population over one hundred thousand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom#Most_populous "List of urban areas in the United Kingdom").

According to [Statistics Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Canada "Statistics Canada"), an urban area in [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada") is an area with a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq mi).[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-StatCan1-61) If two or more urban areas are within 2 km (1.2 mi) of each other by road, they are merged into a single urban area, provided they do not cross [census metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_metropolitan_area "Census metropolitan area") or [census agglomeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_agglomeration "Census agglomeration") boundaries.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-StatCan2-62)

In the [Canada 2011 Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_2011_Census "Canada 2011 Census"), Statistics Canada redesignated urban areas with the new term "[population centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_centre_(Canada) "Population centre (Canada)")";[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-popcentre-63) the new term was chosen in order to better reflect the fact that urban vs. rural is not a strict division, but rather a continuum within which several distinct settlement patterns may exist. For example, a community may fit a strictly statistical definition of an urban area, but may not be commonly thought of as "urban" because it has a smaller population, or functions socially and economically as a suburb of another urban area rather than as a self-contained urban entity, or is geographically remote from other urban communities. Accordingly, the new definition set out three distinct types of population centres: small (population 1,000 to 29,999), medium (population 30,000 to 99,999) and large (population 100,000 or greater).[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-popcentre-63) Despite the change in terminology, however, the demographic definition of a population centre remains unchanged from that of an urban area: a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per km 2.

[Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico") is one of many countries where the urbanization rate is at least 80%. [Mexico City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City "Mexico City"), its capital, is the largest urban area in the country.

In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), the [Census Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau "United States Census Bureau") defines urban areas and delineates urban area boundaries after each census. The Bureau defines an urban area as "a statistical geographic entity consisting of a densely settled core created from [census blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_blocks "Census blocks") and contiguous qualifying territory that together have at least 2,000 housing units or 5,000 persons."[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-US_2020_criteria-65) There were 2,646 urban areas identified by the Census Bureau for 2020. 511 of these had a population of 50,000 or more.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-US_2020_list-66)

For the 2000 and 2010 censuses, the Census Bureau differentiated between two kinds of urban areas: urbanized areas and urban clusters. The term _urbanized area_ denoted an urban area of 50,000 or more people. Urban areas under 50,000 people were called _urban clusters_. Urbanized areas were first delineated in the United States in the 1950 census, while urban clusters were added in the 2000 census. The distinction between urbanized areas and urban clusters was removed for the 2020 census.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-US_2020_criteria-65)

Urban areas consist of a densely-settled urban core, plus surrounding developed areas that meet certain density criteria. Since urban areas are composed of census blocks and not cities, counties, or county-equivalents, urban area boundaries may consist of partial areas of these political units. Urban areas are distinguished from [rural areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_areas "Rural areas"): any area not part of an urban area is considered to be rural by the Census Bureau.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-US_2020_criteria-65)

The largest urban area in the United States is that of [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") and its surrounding suburbs. The New York–[Jersey City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_City,_New_Jersey "Jersey City, New Jersey")–[Newark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark,_New_Jersey "Newark, New Jersey"), NY–NJ urban area had a population of 19,426,449 as of 2020, while the larger [metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area "New York metropolitan area") had a population of 20,140,470, and the [combined statistical area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_statistical_area "Combined statistical area") had a population of 23,582,649. The next five largest urban areas in the U.S. are those of [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles"), [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago"), [Miami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami "Miami"), [Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston "Houston"), and [Dallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas "Dallas").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-US_2020_list-66) 80.0 percent of the population of the United States lives within the boundaries of an urban area as of the 2020 census.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-2020_press_release-67)

The concept of Urbanized Areas as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau is often used as a more accurate gauge of the size of a city, since in different cities and states the lines between city borders and the urbanized area of that city are often not the same. For example, the city of [Greenville, South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina "Greenville, South Carolina") has a city population just over 68,000 and an urbanized area population of around 400,000, while [Greensboro, North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro,_North_Carolina "Greensboro, North Carolina") has a city population just over 285,000 and an urbanized area population of around 300,000— meaning that Greenville is actually "larger" for some intents and purposes, but not for others, such as taxation, local elections, etc.

In the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Agriculture "U.S. Department of Agriculture")'s [natural resources inventory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resources_inventory "Natural resources inventory"), urban areas are officially known as _developed areas_ or urban and built-up areas. Such areas include cities, ethnic villages, other built-up areas of more than 10 ac (4 ha), industrial sites, railroad yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, shooting ranges, institutional and public administration sites, and similar areas. The 1997 national resources inventory placed over 98,000,000 ac (40,000,000 ha) in this category, an increase of 25,000,000 ac (10,000,000 ha) since 1982.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-68)

The [Australian Bureau of Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics "Australian Bureau of Statistics") refers to urban areas as Urban Centres, which it generally defines as population clusters of 1,000 or more people.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-AUS-69) Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, with more than 50% of the population residing in Australia's three biggest urban centres.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_][[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-AUS-69)

[Statistics New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_New_Zealand "Statistics New Zealand") defines urban areas in New Zealand, which are independent of any administrative subdivisions and have no legal basis.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_space#cite_note-defn-72) There are four classes of urban area: major urban areas (population 100,000+), large urban areas (population 30,000–99,999), medium urban areas (population 10,000–29,999) and small urban areas (population 1,000–9,999). As of 2021, there are 7 major urban areas, 13 large urban areas, 22 medium urban areas and 136 small urban areas. Urban areas are reclassified after each [New Zealand census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_census "New Zealand census"), so population changes between censuses does not change an urban area's classification.
