Northeast megalopolis at night, the world's  most economically productive megalopolis [ 1 ] with over 50 million residents, centered on New York City Greater São Paulo at night, as seen from the International Space Station Warsaw metropolitan area An urban area [ a ] is a human settlement with a high population density and an infrastructure of built environment . Urban areas originate through urbanization , and researchers categorize them as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs . In urbanism , the term "urban area" contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets ; in urban sociology or urban anthropology , it often contrasts with natural environment .

The development of earlier predecessors of modern urban areas during the urban revolution of the 4th millennium BCE [ 2 ] led to the formation of human civilization and ultimately to modern urban planning , which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources has led to a human impact on the environment .

Recent historical growth [ edit ] Earth's land use in 2019, built-up area being estimated as 1.5 million square kilometers.

In 1950, 764 million people (or about 30 percent of the world's 2.5 billion people) lived in urban areas.  In 2009, the number of people living in urban areas (3.42 billion) surpassed the number living in rural areas (3.41 billion), and since then the world has become more urban than rural.

[ 3 ] By 2014, it was 3.9 billion (or about 53 percent of the world's 7.3 billion people) that lived in urban areas. The change was driven by a combination of increased total population and increased percent of population living in urban areas.

[ 4 ] This was the first time that the majority of the world's population lived in a city.

[ 5 ] By that time a high estimate calculated up to 3.5 million square kilometers of land were urban, estimates ranging from 1% of global land area.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] In 2014 there were 7.3 billion people living on the planet, [ 8 ] of which the global urban population comprised 3.9 billion. The Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs at that time predicted the urban population would occupy 68% of the world population by 2050, with 90% of that growth coming from Africa and Asia.

[ 9 ] Urbanization [ edit ] Main article: Urbanization Urban land area (km 2 ), 2010 [ 10 ] Urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2020 Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization. They are measured for various purposes, including analyzing population density and urban sprawl . Urban areas are generally found in the United States , Canada , Brazil , Mexico , Argentina , Chile , Japan , Australia , and many other countries where the urbanization rate is high.

Unlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but also satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through commuting , with the urban core city being the primary labor market.

The concept of an "urban area" as used in economic statistics should not be confused with the concept of the "urban area" used in road safety statistics. This term was first created by Geographer Brian Manning. The last concept is also known as " built-up area in road safety ". According to the definition by the Office for National Statistics , "Built-up areas are defined as land which is 'irreversibly urban in character', meaning that they are characteristic of a town or city. They include areas of built-up land with a minimum of 20 hectares (200,000 m 2 ; 49 acres). Any areas [separated by] less than 200 metres [of non-urban space] are linked to become a single built-up area.

[ 11 ] Argentina and Japan are countries where the urbanization rate is over 90% while Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and the United States are countries where the urbanization rate is between 80% and 90%, although within the U.S. state of New Jersey , the urbanization rate is 100%.

[ 12 ] Largest urban areas [ edit ] There are two measures of the degree of urbanization of a population. The first, urban population, describes the percentage of the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the country. The second measure, rate of urbanization, describes the projected average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the given period of time. According to Urbanization by sovereign state article, the world as a whole is 56.2% urbanized, with roughly one-quarter of the countries reported as greater than 80% urbanized. Data is taken from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook estimates from 2020.

An Urban Metric System (UMS) has been conceived that could correct the problem, [ 15 ] since it allows computing the urban area limits and central points, and it can be applied in the same way to all past, present and future population and job distributions. 
It is based on vector field calculations obtained by assuming that, in a given space, all inhabitants and jobs exert the same attractive force A and repulsive force R . The net force ( A - R ) exerted by each inhabitant or job is given by [1/(1 + d )] - [1/( β + d /2)], where d = distance and β is the only parameter.

UMS distinguishes the following types of urban areas, each type corresponding to a given value of β : Urban area Distance at which the attractive force = the repulsive force Value of β 1 Central city 10 km 6 2 Agglomeration 20 km 11 3 Metropolis 40 km 21 4 Patropolis 80 km 41 5 Megalopolis 160 km 81 6 Urban system 320 km 161 7 Urban macrosystem 640 km 321 8 Continental system 1,280 km 641 9 Intercontinental system 2,560 km 1,281 10 World system 5,120 km 2,561 UMS has been applied to some Canadian cases since 2018, but the data presented in this article are still based on the various existing national definitions, which are disparate.

The UN publishes data on cities, urban areas and rural areas, but relies almost entirely on national definitions of these areas. The UN principles and recommendations state that due to different characteristics of urban and rural areas across the globe, a global definition is not possible.

[ 16 ] European countries [ which?

] define urbanized areas on the basis of urban-type land use , not allowing any gaps of typically more than 200 metres (220 yd), and use satellite imagery instead of census blocks to determine the boundaries of the urban area. In less-developed countries [ which?

] , in addition to land use and density requirements, a requirement that a large majority of the population, typically 75%, is not engaged in agriculture and/or fishing is sometimes used.

[ citation needed ] By region [ edit ] Asia [ edit ] East Asia [ edit ] China [ edit ] Main article: List of cities in China by population Since 2000, China 's cities have expanded at an average rate of 10% annually. It is estimated that China's urban population will increase by 292 million people by 2050, [ 4 ] when its cities will house a combined population of over one billion.

[ 17 ] The country's urbanization rate increased from 17.4% to 46.6% between 1978 and 2009.

[ 18 ] Between 150 and 200 million migrant workers work part-time in the major cities, returning home to the countryside periodically with their earnings.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] China has more cities with one million or more long-term residents than any other country, including the three global cities of Beijing , Hong Kong, and Shanghai ; by 2025, the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants.

[ 17 ] The figures in the table below are from the 2008 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large " floating populations " of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult; [ 21 ] the figures below include only long-term residents.

Those are City Corporation , Municipal Corporation (Pourasova) and Upazila town . Among those urban areas, Dhaka is the largest city by population and area, with a population of 19.10 million.

[ 25 ] In Bangladesh , there are total 11 City Corporations and 329 Municipal Corporations and 203 Small towns , which serves as the center for Upazilas . According to 2011 population census, Bangladesh has an urban population of 28%, with a growth rate of 2.8%.

[ 26 ] At this growth rate, it is estimated that the urban population of Bangladesh will reach 79 million or 42% of total population by 2035.

India [ edit ] Main articles: Urbanization in India and List of cities in India by population For the Census of India 2011, the definition of urban area is a place having a minimum population of 5,000 of density 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq mi) or higher, and 75% plus of the male working population employed in non-agricultural activities. Places administered by a municipal corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee are automatically considered urban areas.

[ 27 ] The Census of India 2011 also defined the term "urban agglomeration" as an integrated urban area consisting of a core town together with its "outgrowths" (contiguous suburbs).

Cities include adjacent cantonments .
Urbanisation in Pakistan has increased since the time of independence and has several different causes. The majority of southern Pakistan's population lives along the Indus River . Karachi is its most populous city.

[ 31 ] In the northern half of the country, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore , Faisalabad , Rawalpindi , Islamabad , Gujranwala , Sialkot , Gujrat , Jhelum , Sargodha , Sheikhupura , Nowshera , Mardan and Peshawar . During 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.

[ 32 ] Karachi is the most populated city in Pakistan closely followed by Lahore according to the 2017 Census .

Southeast Asia [ edit ] Philippines [ edit ] In 2020, 54 percent of the Philippine population lived in urban areas.

[ 33 ] With an estimated population of 16.3 million, Metro Manila is the most populous metropolitan area in the Philippines and the 11th in the world . However, the greater urban area is the 5th largest in the world with a population of 20,654,307 people (2010 estimate).

[ 34 ] Singapore [ edit ] Further information: Geography of Singapore and Planning areas of Singapore As an island city-state , about 5.6 million people live and work within 700 square kilometres (270 sq mi).

According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the country has the highest urbanised population in Southeast Asia, with 100 percent of its population living in an urban area.

[ 35 ] The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is responsible for the urban land-use planning , which designates land use and urban density of the country.

[ 36 ] The country is divided into 5 regions for planning purposes by the URA, even though as a city state Singapore is defined as a single continuous urban area. It is further subdivided into 55 urban planning areas , which acts as the boundaries of planned towns within the country.

Europe [ edit ] Finland [ edit ] Main articles: Urban areas in Finland and List of urban areas in Finland by population A street sign in Vimpeli indicating the beginning of an urban area in Finland As in other Nordic countries , an urban area ( taajama in Finnish ) in Finland must have a building at least every 200 m (660 ft) and at least 200 people. To be considered a town or a city ( kaupunki ) for statistical purposes, an urban area must have at least 15,000 people. This is not to be confused with the city / town designation used by municipalities .

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] France [ edit ] Main article: Functional area (France) In France , an urban area ( Fr: aire d'attraction d'une ville ) is a zone encompassing an area of built-up growth (called an "urban unit" ( unité urbaine ) [ 40 ] – close in definition to the North American urban area) and its commuter belt ( couronne ). Americans would find the INSEE definition of the urban area [ 41 ] to be similar to their metropolitan area .

The largest cities in France, in terms of urban area population (2017), are Paris (12,628,266), Lyon (2,323,221), Marseille (1,760,653), Toulouse (1,360,829), Bordeaux (1,247,977), Lille (1,191,117), Nice (1,006,201), Nantes (972,828), Strasbourg (790,087) and Rennes (733,320).

The Randstad has a population of 7 million inhabitants and is the 6th largest metropolitan area in Europe.

Norway [ edit ] Main article: List of urban areas in Norway by population Norway defines urban areas ("tettsteder") similarly to the other Nordic countries . Unlike in Denmark and Sweden, the distance between each building has to be of less than 50 m, although exceptions are made due to parks, industrial areas, rivers, and similar. Groups of houses less than 400 m from the main body of an urban area are included in the urban area.

[ 44 ] Poland [ edit ] In Poland , official "urban" population figures simply refer to those localities which have the status of towns ( miasta ). The "rural" population is that of all areas outside the boundaries of these towns. This distinction may give a misleading impression in some cases, since some localities with only village status may have acquired larger and denser populations than many many smaller towns [ 45 ] with most excessive example of Poznań , most spread urban area of the country with population of the city app. 534 thousand and metropolitan area around 1 million inhabitants. On the other hand, the Katowice urban area with numerous large and medium cities covers 1,468 km and has above 2 million people.
The metropolitan areas in Poland are the biggest urban zones (e.g.

Katowice metropolitan area , Łódź metropolitan area and Szczecin metropolitan area ) and have great impact on the rural surroundings, as it is around Lublin , Radom , Kielce , Tarnów and Białystok .

Russia [ edit ] Moscow , the capital and largest city of Russia Moscow , the capital and largest city of Russia , has a population estimated at 12.4 million residents within the city limits, [ 46 ] while over 17 million residents in the urban area, [ 47 ] and over 20 million residents in the Moscow Metropolitan Area .

There are 1,956 such localities in Sweden , with a population ranging from 200 to 1,372,000 inhabitants.

[ 52 ] United Kingdom [ edit ] Main article: List of urban areas in the United Kingdom In 2013 the United Kingdom 's Office for National Statistics (ONS) published 2011 Built-up Areas – Methodology and Guidance which sets out its definition of a Built-up area (BUA) as an area of built-up land of at least 20 hectares (0.077 sq mi), separated from other settlements by at least 200 metres (660 ft). For 2011 census data there are 5,493 built-up areas, of which 501 are divided into Built-up area sub-divisions (BUASD) for which data is also available. Each built-up area is named algorithmically, using Ordnance Survey place-name data.

[ 53 ] The ONS has produced census results from urban areas since 1951, since 1981 based upon the extent of irreversible urban development indicated on Ordnance Survey maps. The definition is an extent of at least 20 ha and at least 1,500 census residents. Separate areas are linked if less than 200 m (220 yd) apart. Included are transportation features.

[ 54 ] The UK has five Urban Areas with a population over a million and a further sixty nine with a population over one hundred thousand .

[ 58 ] If two or more urban areas are within 2 km (1.2 mi) of each other by road, they are merged into a single urban area, provided they do not cross census metropolitan area or census agglomeration boundaries.

[ 59 ] In the Canada 2011 Census , Statistics Canada redesignated urban areas with the new term " population centre "; [ 60 ] the new term was chosen in order to better reflect the fact that urban vs. rural is not a strict division, but rather a continuum within which several distinct settlement patterns may exist. For example, a community may fit a strictly statistical definition of an urban area, but may not be commonly thought of as "urban" because it has a smaller population, or functions socially and economically as a suburb of another urban area rather than as a self-contained urban entity, or is geographically remote from other urban communities. Accordingly, the new definition set out three distinct types of population centres: small (population 1,000 to 29,999), medium (population 30,000 to 99,999) and large (population 100,000 or greater).

[ 60 ] Despite the change in terminology, however, the demographic definition of a population centre remains unchanged from that of an urban area: a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per km 2 .

United States [ edit ] Main article: List of United States urban areas In the United States , the Census Bureau defines urban areas and delineates urban area boundaries after each census. The Bureau defines an urban area as "a statistical geographic entity consisting of a densely settled core created from census blocks and contiguous qualifying territory that together have at least 2,000 housing units or 5,000 persons." [ 62 ] There were 2,646 urban areas identified by the Census Bureau for 2020. 511 of these had a population of 50,000 or more.

[ 63 ] For the 2000 and 2010 censuses, the Census Bureau differentiated between two kinds of urban areas: urbanized areas and urban clusters. The term urbanized area denoted an urban area of 50,000 or more people. Urban areas under 50,000 people were called urban clusters . Urbanized areas were first delineated in the United States in the 1950 census, while urban clusters were added in the 2000 census. The distinction between urbanized areas and urban clusters was removed for the 2020 census.

[ 62 ] Urban areas consist of a densely-settled urban core, plus surrounding developed areas that meet certain density criteria. Since urban areas are composed of census blocks and not cities, counties, or county-equivalents, urban area boundaries may consist of partial areas of these political units. Urban areas are distinguished from rural areas : any area not part of an urban area is considered to be rural by the Census Bureau.

[ 62 ] The largest urban area in the United States is that of New York City and its surrounding suburbs. The New York– Jersey City – Newark , NY–NJ urban area had a population of 19,426,449 as of 2020, while the larger metropolitan area had a population of 20,140,470, and the combined statistical area had a population of 23,582,649. The next five largest urban areas in the U.S. are those of Los Angeles , Chicago , Miami , Houston , and Dallas .

[ 63 ] 80.0 percent of the population of the United States lives within the boundaries of an urban area as of the 2020 census.

[ 64 ] The skyscrapers of New York City , the most populous city in the United States and the most populous U.S. metropolitan area , are almost all situated in Manhattan , the world's largest central business district , seen here in this panorama in February 2018, as viewed from Weehawken, New Jersey .

For example, the city of Greenville, South Carolina has a city population just over 68,000 and an urbanized area population of around 400,000, while Greensboro, North Carolina has a city population just over 285,000 and an urbanized area population of around 300,000 — meaning that Greenville is actually "larger" for some intents and purposes, but not for others, such as taxation, local elections, etc.

In the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's natural resources inventory , urban areas are officially known as developed areas or urban and built-up areas. Such areas include cities, ethnic villages, other built-up areas of more than 10 ac (4 ha), industrial sites, railroad yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, shooting ranges, institutional and public administration sites, and similar areas. The 1997 national resources inventory placed over 98,000,000 ac (40,000,000 ha) in this category, an increase of 25,000,000 ac (10,000,000 ha) since 1982.

As of 2021, there are 7 major urban areas, 13 large urban areas, 22 medium urban areas and 136 small urban areas.
