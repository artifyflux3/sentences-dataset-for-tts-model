Name [ edit ] Baoding was known as Shanggu, Baozhou, Shoocheng and Baofu in ancient times.

[ 9 ] The city's name, Baoding (Chinese: 保定 ), [ 10 ] [ 11 ] dates back to the Song and Yuan dynasties, In 1239, the Yuan Dynasty changed the name of Shuntian Army to Shuntian Road, which means "complying with the destiny of heaven", and Baozhou was renamed Luzhi ( 路治 ). Because Baozhou was the southern gate of the capital in the Yuan Dynasty, Shuntian Road was changed to Baoding Road in 1275, which means "defend the capital and stabilize the world".

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] The name is roughly interpreted as "protecting the capital", referring to the city's proximity to Beijing .

( August 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Baoding has a history dating back to the Western Han Dynasty .

Prehistory [ edit ] The Nanzhuangtou site near Baiyang Lake is one of the earliest Neolithic site discovered in North China , dating back approximately 10,500–9,700 years.

[ 14 ] Other Neolithic sites in Baoding include Diaoyutai and Beifudi .

[ 15 ] Early history [ edit ] During the Warring States period , what is now Baoding was along the dividing line between the Yan and Zhao states.

One of the capitals of Yan during this period, Xiadu , is located in what is now Yi County , and from 400 to 300 BC may have been the largest cities in the world , with an estimated population of over 300,000.

[ 16 ] Imperial era [ edit ] In 960 the Song dynasty established the Bao prefecture ("Baozhou") with the administrative office in Baosai County (modern Baoding).

[ 17 ] This lasted until 1241, when the Mongol Empire (who conquered the Jin dynasty in 1234) abolished it, incorporating Baozhou into the Central Region .

In the year 1213 the Mongol army invaded and destroyed Baozhou, leaving it in ruins until it was reconstructed in 1227 during the Yuan dynasty . The region acquired the name "Baoding" in 1275.

In 1669, Baoding became the capital of Zhili , ruled over by a Viceroy until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.

In 1902, Yuan Shikai , then Viceroy, established the Baoding Military Academy . Birthplace of many famous ROC and Communist generals in the early 20th century.

Contemporary history [ edit ] On August 1, 1949, the People's Government of Hebei province was established, Baoding was the capital of the province, and the city of Baoding was a provincial municipality. On August 9, the administrative inspector's office of the Baoding district was established, and it was established as the administrative inspector's office of the county district.

[ 18 ] In May 1958, the capital of Hebei was moved to Tianjin , then back to Baoding in January 1966, to Shijiazhuang in February 1968. In December 1994, the Baoding area merged with Baoding to become a provincial city.

[ 19 ] In April 2017, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council announced the decision to transform Baoding's Xiong , Rongcheng , and Anxin counties into Xiong'an New Area , a new development area of national significance, with a focus on innovation, sustainability and quality of life, following the successes of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and Shanghai's Pudong New Area .

[ 20 ] Geography [ edit ] Baoding is located in the west-central portion of Hebei province and lies on the North China Plain , with the Taihang Mountains to the west. Bordering prefecture-level cities in the province are Zhangjiakou to the north, Langfang and Cangzhou to the east, and Shijiazhuang and Hengshui to the south. Baoding also borders Beijing to the northeast and Shanxi to the west.

[ 21 ] The geographical coordinates of Baoding are between 113°40'-116°20' east longitude and 38°10'-40°00' north latitude.

[ 5 ] Elevations in Baoding's administrative area decrease from northwest to southeast. The western parts are dominated by mountains and hills that are generally more than 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) tall; this area includes parts of Laishui , Yi , Mancheng , Shunping , Tang , and Fuping Counties as well as the entirety of Laiyuan County, occupying 30.6% of the prefecture's area.

[ 1 ] The highest peak is Mount Waitou ( 歪头山 ), with an elevation of 2,286 metres (7,500 ft).

[ 1 ] Moving southeast from this area, one encounters low-lying mountains and hills, taking up 18.9% of the prefecture's area.

[ 1 ] Further to the east lies generally flat terrain of 30 to 100 metres (98 to 330 ft) elevation. Here the primary rivers are the Xiaoyi River ( 孝义河 ), Fu River ( 府河 ), Bao River ( 瀑河 ), Ping River ( 萍河 ), Juma River ( 拒马河 ), Yishui River ( 易水河 ), Tang River ( 唐河 ), Cao River ( 漕河 ), Zhulong River ( 潴龙河 ), Qingshui River ( 清水河 ), and Sha River ( 沙河 ).

Climate [ edit ] Baoding has a continental, monsoon -influenced humid continental climate / semi-arid climate ( Köppen Dwa/BSk ), [ 23 ] characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, very dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn is similar to spring in temperature and lack of rainfall. The annual rainfall, about 60% of which falls in July and August alone, is highly variable and not reliable. The average annual runoff is 2.45 billion cubic meters.

[ 5 ] In the city itself, this amount has averaged to a meagre 496.1 millimetres (19.5 in) per annum. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from −2.7 °C (27.1 °F) in January to 27.1 °C (80.8 °F) in July, and the annual mean is 13.3 °C (55.9 °F).

[ 41 ] The city's streets follow a rough grid pattern, although this is less obvious in the older part of the city. The traditional main street of old Baoding is Yuhua Road, running from the city's centre to its eastern edge. Most of Baoding's historic buildings are located in this area, along with some of its larger shopping centres.

[ 42 ] Other major streets include Dongfeng Road and Chaoyang Avenue. There is a ring road around the city.

Baoding is home to Hebei University , North China Electric Power University , three other universities and twelve colleges.

[ 43 ] Historic sites [ edit ] A courtyard in the mansion of the governor of Zhili Baoding contains a number of notable historic sites. In the city proper, there can be found a historic provincial governor's mansion and an ancient lotus garden. In the hills to the northwest of the city, near the suburb of Mancheng , there are the Mancheng Han Tombs , where Prince Liu Sheng and his wife Dou Wan were buried.
