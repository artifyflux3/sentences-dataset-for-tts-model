[ 1 ] It contains many O- and B-type stars , and many of the nearest star-forming regions of the local Orion Arm , to which the Sun belongs. The relative proximity of these star-forming regions spurred the Gould Belt Survey project to determine what caused them.

It was long speculated that the belt was a physical structure in the galactic disk, but data from the Gaia survey indicate that several of its star-forming regions belong instead to the separate Radcliffe wave and Split [ clarification needed ] linear structures in the Orion Arm, and that the circular appearance of the belt results mostly from the projection of these structures onto the celestial sphere .

[ 2 ] The belt contains bright, young stars which formed about 30 to 50 million years ago in several constellations.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] These lie along a great circle slightly inclined to the Milky Way. including (in order from Taurus): Taurus , Perseus , Cepheus , Lacerta , Scorpius , Lupus , southern Centaurus , Crux (the Southern Cross), Carina , Vela , Puppis , Canis Major , and Orion .

Star-forming regions and OB associations that make up this region include the Orion Nebula and the Orion molecular clouds, the Scorpius–Centaurus OB association , Cepheus OB2, Perseus OB2, and the Taurus–Auriga molecular clouds . The Serpens molecular cloud containing star-forming regions W40 and Serpens south is often included in Gould Belt surveys, but is not formally part of the Gould Belt due to its greater distance.

A theory proposed around 2009 suggests that the Gould Belt formed about 30 million years ago when a blob of dark matter collided with the molecular cloud in our region. There is also evidence for similar Gould belts in other galaxies.
