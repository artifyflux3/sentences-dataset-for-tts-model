[ 6 ] Research [ edit ] Sheppard has studied fatigue and fracture of structural components, producing technical papers, reports, and textbooks on "weld fatigue and impact failures, fracture mechanics and applied finite element analysis." [ 8 ] She has also led studies of engineering education, including the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching: Educating Engineers: Designing for the Future of the Field.

[ 6 ] Sheppard has been principal investigator on multiple National Science Foundation grants focused on engineer educational methods, including Synthesis Coalition (1986–1995), founding the Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education (2003–2009) and the National Center for Engineering Pathways to Innovation (2011–2016).

[ 6 ] Honors [ edit ] In 2004, the American Society for Engineering Education presented Sheppard with the Chester F. Carlson Award, sponsored by Xerox , as an "innovator in engineering education who, by motivation and ability to extend beyond the accepted tradition, has made a significant contribution to the profession."
