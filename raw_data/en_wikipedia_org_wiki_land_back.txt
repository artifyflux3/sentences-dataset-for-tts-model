[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Activists have also used the Land Back framework in Mexico, [ 4 ] and scholars have applied it in New Zealand and Fiji.

[ 5 ] Land Back is part of a broader Indigenous movement for decolonization .

[ 6 ] [ 1 ] Description [ edit ] Land Back banner at a protest in Washington, D.C.

, 2024 Land Back aims to reestablish Indigenous political authority over territories that Indigenous tribes claim by treaty.

[ 7 ] Scholars from the Indigenous-run Yellowhead Institute at Toronto Metropolitan University describe it as a process of reclaiming Indigenous jurisdiction.

[ 3 ] The NDN Collective describes it as synonymous with decolonisation and dismantling white supremacy .

[ 1 ] Land Back advocates for Indigenous rights, preserves languages and traditions, and works toward food sovereignty , decent housing, and a clean environment.

[ 3 ] The Black Hills land claim and protests at Mount Rushmore during Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign were a catalyzing moment for the movement in the United States.

[ 1 ] [ 8 ] Philosophy [ edit ] The NDN Collective describes the Land Back campaign as a metanarrative that ties together many different Indigenous organizations similar to the Black Lives Matter campaign.

[ 1 ] They say that the campaign enables decentralised Indigenous leadership and addresses structural racism faced by Indigenous people that is rooted in theft of their land.

[ 1 ] Land Back promotes a return to communal land ownership of traditional and unceded Indigenous lands and rejects colonial concepts of real estate and private land ownership.

[ 7 ] Return of land is not only economic, but also implies the return of relationships and self-governance.

[ 5 ] In some cases Land Back promotes a land tax that seeks to collect revenue on people who are of non-indigenous origins.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Other forms of Land Back involve indigenous communities managing National Parks or Federal Lands.

[ 11 ] Methods [ edit ] In some cases, land is directly returned to Indigenous people when private landowners, municipalities, or governments give the land back to Indigenous tribes. This may take the form of a simple transaction within the colonial real estate framework.

[ 2 ] Indigenous-led projects may also use community land trusts to reserve lands for their group.

[ 12 ] Actions [ edit ] In July 2020, activists from NDN Collective held a protest on a highway leading to Mount Rushmore , where Donald Trump was to give a campaign speech. The site, known to the Sioux in English as "The Six Grandfathers," [ 13 ] is on sacred, unceded land, subject to the Black Hills land claim . These protestors drafted the "Land Back Manifesto", which seeks "the reclamation of everything stolen from the original Peoples".

[ 14 ] Also in 2020, Haudenosaunee people from the Six Nations of the Grand River blockaded 1492 Land Back Lane to shut down a housing development on their unceded territory.

[ 15 ] On July 4, 2021, in Rapid City, South Dakota , a city very close to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation , four people were arrested after climbing a structure downtown and hanging an upside-down US flag emblazoned with the words "Land Back".

[ 16 ] Transfers [ edit ] The Wiyot people have lived for thousands of years on Duluwat Island , in Humboldt Bay on California's northern coast.

[ 2 ] In 2004 the Eureka City Council transferred land back to the Wiyot tribe, to add to land the Wiyot had purchased.

[ 17 ] The council transferred another 60 acres (24 ha) in 2006.

[ 18 ] The Mashpee Wampanoag have lived in Massachusetts and eastern Rhode Island for thousands of years. In 2007, about 300 acres (1.2 km 2 ) of Massachusetts land was put into trust as a reservation for the tribe. Since then, a legal battle has left the tribe's status—and claim to the land—in limbo.

[ 2 ] In 2016, Dr. Mohan Singh Virick, a Punjabi Sikh doctor who served Indigenous people in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada for 50 years, donated 350 acres (140 ha) of land to Eskasoni First Nation .

[ 19 ] He also donated a building in Sydney to help house Eskasoni's growing population.

[ 20 ] In October 2018, the city of Vancouver , British Columbia returned ancient burial site (the Great Marpole Midden ) land back to the Musqueam people. The land is home to ancient remains of a Musqueam house site.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] In 2019, the United Methodist Church gave 3 acres (1.2 ha) of historic land back to the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma .

[ 2 ] The US government in 1819 had promised the tribe 148,000 acres (600 km 2 ) of land in what is now Kansas City, Kansas. When 664 Wyandotte people arrived, the land had been given to someone else.

[ 23 ] In July 2020, an organization of self-identified Esselen descendants purchased a 1,200-acre  ranch (4.9 km 2 ) near Big Sur , California , as part of a larger $4.5m deal. This acquisition, in historical Esselen lands, aims to protect old-growth forest and wildlife, and the Little Sur River.

[ 24 ] Land on the Saanich Peninsula in British Columbia was returned to the Tsartlip First Nation in December 2020.

[ 25 ] Management of the 18,800-acre (76 km 2 ) National Bison Range was transferred from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service back to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in 2021.

[ 26 ] In August 2022, the Red Cliff Chippewa in northern Wisconsin had 1,500 acres (6.1 km 2 ) of land along the Lake Superior shoreline returned to them from the Bayfield County government. This came after the tribe signed a 2017 memorandum of understanding with the county, acknowledging the Red Cliff Chippewa's desire to see their reservation boundaries restored in full.

[ 27 ] In October 2022, a 1-acre site was returned to the Tongva Taraxat Paxaavxa Conservancy by a private resident in Altadena , which marked the first time the Tongva had land in Los Angeles County in 200 years.

[ 28 ] In 2024, the Government of British Columbia transferred the title of more than 200 islands off Canada's west coast to the Haida people, recognizing the nation's aboriginal land title throughout Haida Gwaii .

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] In 2025, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians purchased more than 2,000 acres of land near the Table Rocks preserve north of Medford, Oregon .

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] On March 21, 2025, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker signed legislation authorizing the transfer of ownership of Shabbona Lake State Park to the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation .

[ 33 ] In June 2025, the land purchases to create the Blue Creek Salmon Sanctuary and Yurok Tribal Community Forest were completed. Western Rivers Conservancy helped finance the purchases and create the protected area in cooperation with the Yurok Tribe . The land will now be managed by the Yurok Tribe in what is said to be the largest land back conservation deal to date.
