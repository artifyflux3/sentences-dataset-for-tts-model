Atoms are thus the simplest well-formed formulas of the logic. Compound formulas are formed by combining the atomic formulas using the logical connectives.

The precise form of atomic formulas depends on the logic under consideration; for propositional logic , for example, a propositional variable is often more briefly referred to as an "atomic formula", but, more precisely, a propositional variable is not an atomic formula but a formal expression that denotes an atomic formula. For predicate logic , the atoms are predicate symbols together with their arguments, each argument being a term .  In model theory , atomic formulas are merely strings of symbols with a given signature , which may or may not be satisfiable with respect to a given model.

[ 1 ] Atomic formula in first-order logic [ edit ] The well-formed terms and propositions of ordinary first-order logic have the following syntax : Terms : t ≡ ≡ c ∣ ∣ x ∣ ∣ f ( t 1 , … … , t n ) {\displaystyle t\equiv c\mid x\mid f(t_{1},\dotsc ,t_{n})} , that is, a term is recursively defined to be a constant c (a named object from the domain of discourse ), or a variable x (ranging over the objects in the domain of discourse), or an n -ary function f whose arguments are terms t k . Functions map tuples of objects to objects.

Propositions: A , B , .

≡ ≡ P ( t 1 , … … , t n ) ∣ ∣ A ∧ ∧ B ∣ ∣ ⊤ ⊤ ∣ ∣ A ∨ ∨ B ∣ ∣ ⊥ ⊥ ∣ ∣ A ⊃ ⊃ B ∣ ∣ ∀ ∀ x .

A ∣ ∣ ∃ ∃ x .

A {\displaystyle A,B,...\equiv P(t_{1},\dotsc ,t_{n})\mid A\wedge B\mid \top \mid A\vee B\mid \bot \mid A\supset B\mid \forall x.\ A\mid \exists x.\ A} , that is, a proposition is recursively defined to be an n -ary predicate P whose arguments are terms t k , or an expression composed of logical connectives (and, or) and quantifiers (for-all, there-exists) used with other propositions.

An atomic formula or atom is simply a predicate applied to a tuple of terms; that is, an atomic formula is a formula of the form P ( t 1 ,…, t n ) for P a predicate, and the t n terms.

All other well-formed formulae are obtained by composing atoms with logical connectives and quantifiers.

For example, the formula ∀ x. P ( x ) ∧ ∃ y. Q ( y , f ( x )) ∨ ∃ z. R ( z ) contains the atoms P ( x ) {\displaystyle P(x)} Q ( y , f ( x ) ) {\displaystyle Q(y,f(x))} R ( z ) {\displaystyle R(z)} .

As there are no quantifiers appearing in an atomic formula, all occurrences of variable symbols in an atomic formula are free.

[ 2 ] See also [ edit ] In model theory , structures assign an interpretation to the atomic formulas.

In proof theory , polarity assignment for atomic formulas is an essential component of focusing .
