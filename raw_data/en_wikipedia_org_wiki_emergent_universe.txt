Several such scenarios have been proposed in the literature.

"Cosmic egg" scenarios [ edit ] A popular version proposed by George Ellis and others involves the Universe shaped like a 3-dimensional sphere (or another compact manifold ) until a rolling scalar field begins inflating it. These models are notable as potentially avoiding both a Big Bang singularity and a quantum gravity era.

[ 1 ] Criticism [ edit ] This proposal has been criticised by Vilenkin and Mithani [ 2 ] and on different grounds by Aguirre and Kehayias [ 3 ] as inconsistent if quantum-mechanical effects are taken into account, however, it has been suggested that in more exotic scenarios one or both of these issues might be circumvented.

[ 4 ] "Rube Goldberg cosmology" scenario [ edit ] One of such more exotic emergent Universe scenarios, nicknamed "Rube Goldberg cosmology", features the pre-inflationary Universe shaped like a corridor with two finite ( compactified ) dimensions and two waves traveling along the third dimension towards each other from past-eternity with the speed of light (likened by the author to two trains loaded with explosives headed for a collision on the same railroad track) that initiate inflation or Big Bang upon colliding.
