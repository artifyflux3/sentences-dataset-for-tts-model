Liouville space is itself a Hilbert space under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Abstractly, Liouville space is equivalent ( isometrically isomorphic ) to the tensor product of a Hilbert space with its dual .

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] A common computational technique to organize computations in Liouville space is vectorization .

[ 2 ] Liouville space underlies the density operator formalism and is a common computation technique in the study of open quantum systems .
