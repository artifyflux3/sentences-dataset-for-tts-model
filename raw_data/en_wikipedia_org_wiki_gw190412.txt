[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In April 2020, it was announced as the first time a collision of a pair of very differently sized black holes has been detected.

[ 3 ] As a result of this asymmetry, the signal included two measurable harmonics with frequencies approximately a factor 1.5 (a perfect fifth ) apart.

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] The collision took place 2.4 billion light-years away.

[ 3 ] The heavier of the black holes had a mass of 29.7 solar masses, and the lighter one around 8.4 solar masses.

[ 3 ] The difference in mass meant that the secondary harmonic in the signal was strong enough to be detected, allowing researchers to perform a test of general relativity and determine that the larger black hole was spinning.
