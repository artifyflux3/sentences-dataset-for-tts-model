**Earth science** or **geoscience** includes all fields of [natural science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science") related to the planet [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-1) This is a branch of science dealing with the physical, chemical, and biological complex constitutions and synergistic linkages of Earth's four spheres: the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere"), [hydrosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere "Hydrosphere")/[cryosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryosphere "Cryosphere"), [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere"), and [geosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosphere "Geosphere") (or [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere "Lithosphere")). Earth science can be considered to be a branch of [planetary science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_science "Planetary science") but with a much older history.

Layers of [sedimentary rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentary_rock "Sedimentary rock") in [Makhtesh Ramon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhtesh_Ramon "Makhtesh Ramon")

[Geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology") is broadly the study of Earth's structure, substance, and processes. Geology is largely the study of the [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere "Lithosphere"), or Earth's surface, including the [crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_crust "Earth's crust") and [rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology) "Rock (geology)"). It includes the physical characteristics and processes that occur in the lithosphere as well as how they are affected by [geothermal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_energy "Geothermal energy"). It incorporates aspects of chemistry, physics, and biology as elements of geology interact. [Historical geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_geology "Historical geology") is the application of geology to interpret [Earth history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth "History of Earth") and how it has changed over time.

[Geochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochemistry "Geochemistry") studies the chemical components and processes of the Earth. [Geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics "Geophysics") studies the physical properties of the Earth. [Paleontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology "Paleontology") studies fossilized biological material in the lithosphere. [Planetary geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_geology "Planetary geology") studies geoscience as it pertains to extraterrestrial bodies. [Geomorphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomorphology "Geomorphology") studies the origin of landscapes. [Structural geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_geology "Structural geology") studies the deformation of rocks to produce mountains and lowlands. Resource geology studies how energy resources can be obtained from minerals. [Environmental geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_geology "Environmental geology") studies how pollution and contaminants affect soil and rock.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmithPun200614%E2%80%9316-2)[Mineralogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralogy "Mineralogy") is the study of minerals and includes the study of mineral formation, [crystal structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure "Crystal structure"), hazards associated with minerals, and the physical and chemical properties of minerals.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHaldar2020109-3)[Petrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrology "Petrology") is the study of rocks, including the formation and composition of rocks. [Petrography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrography "Petrography") is a branch of petrology that studies the typology and classification of rocks.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHaldar2020145-4)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Volcano_q.jpg/250px-Volcano_q.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Volcano_q.jpg)

A [volcanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic "Volcanic") eruption is the release of stored energy from below Earth's surface.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-5)

[Plate tectonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics "Plate tectonics"), [mountain ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range "Mountain range"), [volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano "Volcano"), and [earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake "Earthquake") are [geological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological "Geological") phenomena that can be explained in terms of physical and chemical processes in the Earth's crust.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-6) Beneath the Earth's crust lies the [mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_mantle "Earth's mantle") which is heated by the [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay") of [heavy elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_elements "Heavy elements"). The mantle is not quite solid and consists of [magma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma "Magma") which is in a state of semi-perpetual [convection](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/convection "wikt:convection"). This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as plate tectonics.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-adams_tectonics-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-oldroyd_tectonics-10) Areas of the crust where new crust is created are called _divergent boundaries_, those where it is brought back into the Earth are _convergent boundaries_ and those where plates slide past each other, but no new lithospheric material is created or destroyed, are referred to as [transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transform_fault "Transform fault") (or conservative) boundaries.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-adams_tectonics-8)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-oldroyd_tectonics-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-11)[Earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquakes "Earthquakes") result from the movement of the lithospheric plates, and they often occur near convergent boundaries where parts of the crust are forced into the earth as part of subduction.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-smith_subduction-12)

Plate tectonics might be thought of as the process by which the Earth is resurfaced. As the result of [seafloor spreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading "Seafloor spreading"), new crust and lithosphere is created by the flow of magma from the [mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology) "Mantle (geology)") to the near surface, through fissures, where it cools and solidifies. Through [subduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction "Subduction"), oceanic crust and lithosphere vehemently returns to the convecting mantle.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-adams_tectonics-8)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-oldroyd_tectonics-10)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-13) Volcanoes result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material. Crust material that is forced into the [asthenosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthenosphere "Asthenosphere") melts, and some portion of the melted material becomes light enough to rise to the surfaceâ€”giving birth to volcanoes.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-adams_tectonics-8)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-smith_subduction-12)

Atmospheric science
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earth_science&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Atmospheric science")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Magnetosphere_rendition.jpg/250px-Magnetosphere_rendition.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetosphere_rendition.jpg)

The [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere") shields the surface of Earth from the charged particles of the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind").

(_image not to scale._)

Atmospheric science initially developed in the late-19th century as a means to forecast the weather through [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"), the study of weather. [Atmospheric chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_chemistry "Atmospheric chemistry") was developed in the 20th century to measure [air pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution "Air pollution") and expanded in the 1970s in response to [acid rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain "Acid rain"). [Climatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology "Climatology") studies the [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate") and [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-14)

The [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere"), [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere"), [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere"), [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere"), and [exosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere "Exosphere") are the five layers which make up Earth's atmosphere. 75% of the mass in the atmosphere is located within the troposphere, the lowest layer. In all, the atmosphere is made up of about 78.0% [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen"), 20.9% [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"), and 0.92% [argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon "Argon"), and small amounts of other gases including CO 2 and water vapor.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-adams_atmosphere-15) Water vapor and CO 2 cause the Earth's atmosphere to catch and hold the Sun's energy through the [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect "Greenhouse effect").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-16) This makes Earth's surface warm enough for liquid water and life. In addition to trapping heat, the atmosphere also protects living organisms by shielding the Earth's surface from [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays "Cosmic rays").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-17) The [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field")â€”created by the internal motions of the coreâ€”produces the [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere") which protects Earth's atmosphere from the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-18) As the Earth is [4.5 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_earth "Age of the earth") years old,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-age_earth-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-20) it would have lost its atmosphere by now if there were no protective magnetosphere.

Earth's magnetic field
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earth_science&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Earth's magnetic field")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Geodynamo_Between_Reversals.gif/250px-Geodynamo_Between_Reversals.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geodynamo_Between_Reversals.gif)

Computer simulation of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")'s field in a period of normal polarity between reversals.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-Earth's_magnetic_field_selfconsistent-21) The lines represent magnetic field lines, blue when the field points towards the center and yellow when away. The rotation axis of Earth is centered and vertical. The dense clusters of lines are within Earth's core.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-Earth's_magnetic_field_Glatzmaier-22)

[Earth's magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field"), also known as the geomagnetic field, is the [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") that extends from [Earth's interior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_Earth "Structure of Earth") out into space, where it interacts with the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind"), a stream of [charged particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle "Charged particle") emanating from the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"). The magnetic field is generated by [electric currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") due to the motion of [convection currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_current "Convection current") of a mixture of molten [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron") and [nickel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel "Nickel") in [Earth's outer core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_outer_core "Earth's outer core"): these convection currents are caused by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a [geodynamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodynamo "Geodynamo").

The magnitude of Earth's magnetic field at its surface ranges from 25 to 65 Î¼T (0.25 to 0.65 G).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-Earth's_magnetic_field_GeomagneticReferenceField-23) As an approximation, it is represented by a field of a [magnetic dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole "Magnetic dipole") currently tilted at an angle of about 11Â° with respect to [Earth's rotational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") axis, as if there were an enormous [bar magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_magnet "Bar magnet") placed at that angle through the center of Earth. The [North geomagnetic pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_geomagnetic_pole "North geomagnetic pole") ([Ellesmere Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellesmere_Island "Ellesmere Island"), [Nunavut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut "Nunavut"), Canada) actually represents the South pole of Earth's magnetic field, and conversely the [South geomagnetic pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_geomagnetic_pole "South geomagnetic pole") corresponds to the north pole of Earth's magnetic field (because opposite magnetic poles attract and the north end of a magnet, like a compass needle, points toward Earth's South magnetic field.)

While the North and South [magnetic poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles_of_astronomical_bodies "Poles of astronomical bodies") are usually located near the geographic poles, they slowly and continuously move over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary [compasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass "Compass") to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, [Earth's field reverses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal "Geomagnetic reversal") and the [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole "North Magnetic Pole") and [South Magnetic Poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Magnetic_Pole "South Magnetic Pole") abruptly switch places. These reversals of the [geomagnetic poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_pole "Geomagnetic pole") leave a record in rocks that are of value to [paleomagnetists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleomagnetism "Paleomagnetism") in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors. The [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere") is defined by the extent of Earth's magnetic field in space or [geospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospace "Geospace"). It extends above the [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere "Ionosphere"), several tens of thousands of kilometres into [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"), protecting Earth from the charged particles of the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind") and [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays "Cosmic rays") that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including the [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer "Ozone layer") that protects Earth from [harmful ultraviolet radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet#Harmful_effects "Ultraviolet").

Movement of water through the [water cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle "Water cycle")

Hydrology is the study of the hydrosphere and the [movement of water on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle "Water cycle"). It emphasizes the study of how humans use and interact with freshwater supplies. Study of water's movement is closely related to [geomorphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomorphology "Geomorphology") and other branches of Earth science. Applied hydrology involves engineering to maintain aquatic environments and distribute water supplies. Subdisciplines of hydrology include [oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography "Oceanography"), [hydrogeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogeology "Hydrogeology"), [ecohydrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecohydrology "Ecohydrology"), and [glaciology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaciology "Glaciology"). Oceanography is the study of oceans.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-24) Hydrogeology is the study of [groundwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater "Groundwater"). It includes the mapping of groundwater supplies and the analysis of groundwater contaminants. Applied hydrogeology seeks to prevent contamination of groundwater and [mineral springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_spring "Mineral spring") and make it available as [drinking water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water "Drinking water"). The earliest exploitation of groundwater resources dates back to 3000 BC, and hydrogeology as a science was developed by hydrologists beginning in the 17th century.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-25) Ecohydrology is the study of ecological systems in the [hydrosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere "Hydrosphere"). It can be divided into the physical study of aquatic ecosystems and the biological study of aquatic organisms. Ecohydrology includes the effects that organisms and aquatic ecosystems have on one another as well as how these ecosystems are affected by humans.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-26) Glaciology is the study of the cryosphere, including [glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier") and coverage of the Earth by ice and snow. Concerns of glaciology include access to glacial freshwater, mitigation of glacial hazards, obtaining resources that exist beneath frozen land, and addressing the effects of climate change on the cryosphere.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-27)

Ecology is the study of the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere"). This includes the study of nature and of how living things interact with the Earth and one another and the consequences of that. It considers how living things use resources such as [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"), [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water"), and [nutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient") from the Earth to sustain themselves. It also considers how humans and other living creatures cause changes to nature.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-28)

Physical geography is the study of [Earth's systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_system_science "Earth system science") and how they interact with one another as part of a single self-contained system. It incorporates astronomy, mathematical geography, meteorology, climatology, geology, geomorphology, biology, biogeography, pedology, and soils geography. Physical geography is distinct from [human geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_geography "Human geography"), which studies the human populations on Earth, though it does include human effects on the environment.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-29)

[Methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology "Methodology") vary depending on the nature of the subjects being studied. Studies typically fall into one of three categories: observational, experimental, or theoretical. Earth scientists often conduct sophisticated computer analysis or visit an interesting location to study earth phenomena (e.g. Antarctica or [hot spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_(geology) "Hotspot (geology)") island chains).

A foundational idea in Earth science is the notion of [uniformitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism "Uniformitarianism"), which states that "ancient geologic features are interpreted by understanding active processes that are readily observed." In other words, any geologic processes at work in the present have operated in the same ways throughout geologic time. This enables those who study [Earth history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_history "Earth history") to apply knowledge of how the Earth's processes operate in the present to gain insight into how the planet has evolved and changed throughout long history.

In Earth science, it is common to conceptualize the Earth's surface as consisting of several distinct layers, often referred to as spheres: the [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere "Lithosphere"), the [hydrosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere "Hydrosphere"), the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere"), and the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere"), this concept of spheres is a useful tool for understanding the Earth's surface and its various processes[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-wheeling-30) these correspond to [rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology) "Rock (geology)"), [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water"), [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air "Air") and [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life"). Also included by some are the [cryosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryosphere "Cryosphere") (corresponding to [ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice")) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere and the [pedosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedosphere "Pedosphere") (corresponding to [soil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil "Soil")) as an active and intermixed sphere. The following [fields of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_science "Branches of science") are generally categorized within the Earth sciences:

*   [Geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology") describes the [rocky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology) "Rock (geology)") parts of the [Earth's crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_crust "Earth's crust") (or [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere "Lithosphere")) and its historic development. Major subdisciplines are [mineralogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralogy "Mineralogy") and [petrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrology "Petrology"), [geomorphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomorphology "Geomorphology"), [paleontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology "Paleontology"), [stratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratigraphy "Stratigraphy"), [structural geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_geology "Structural geology"), [engineering geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_geology "Engineering geology"), and [sedimentology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentology "Sedimentology").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-smith_5-32)
*   [Physical geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_geography "Physical geography") focuses on [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography") as an Earth science. Physical geography is the study of Earth's seasons, climate, atmosphere, soil, streams, landforms, and oceans. Physical geography can be divided into several branches or related fields, as follows: [geomorphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomorphology "Geomorphology"), [biogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography "Biogeography"), [environmental geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_geography "Environmental geography"), [palaeogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeogeography "Palaeogeography"), [climatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology "Climatology"), [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"), [coastal geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_geography "Coastal geography"), [hydrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology "Hydrology"), [ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology "Ecology"), [glaciology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaciology "Glaciology").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
*   [Geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics "Geophysics") and [geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy "Geodesy") investigate the [shape of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth "Figure of the Earth"), its reaction to forces and its [magnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") and [gravity fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_field "Gravity field"). Geophysicists explore the [Earth's core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_core "Inner core") and [mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_mantle "Earth's mantle") as well as the [tectonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics "Plate tectonics") and [seismic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology "Seismology") activity of the lithosphere.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-smith_5-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-34) Geophysics is commonly used to supplement the work of [geologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologist "Geologist") in developing a comprehensive understanding of crustal geology, particularly in mineral and petroleum exploration. [Seismologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismologist "Seismologist") use [geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical_survey "Geophysical survey") to understand plate tectonic movement, as well as predict seismic activity.
*   [Geochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochemistry "Geochemistry") studies the processes that control the abundance, composition, and distribution of chemical compounds and isotopes in geologic environments. Geochemists use the tools and principles of chemistry to study the Earth's composition, structure, processes, and other physical aspects. Major subdisciplines are [aqueous geochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_geochemistry "Aqueous geochemistry"), [cosmochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmochemistry "Cosmochemistry"), [isotope geochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope_geochemistry "Isotope geochemistry") and [biogeochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemistry "Biogeochemistry").
*   [Soil science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_science "Soil science") covers the outermost layer of the Earth's crust that is subject to [soil formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_formation "Soil formation") processes (or [pedosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedosphere "Pedosphere")).[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-35) Major subdivisions in this field of study include [edaphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edaphology "Edaphology") and [pedology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedology_(soil_study) "Pedology (soil study)").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-36)
*   [Ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology "Ecology") covers the interactions between organisms and their environment. This field of study differentiates the study of Earth from other planets in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), Earth being the only planet teeming with life.
*   [Hydrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology "Hydrology"), [oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography "Oceanography") and [limnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limnology "Limnology") are studies which focus on the movement, distribution, and quality of the water and involve all the components of the hydrologic cycle on the Earth and its atmosphere (or [hydrosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere "Hydrosphere")). "Sub-disciplines of hydrology include hydrometeorology, surface water hydrology, hydrogeology, watershed science, forest hydrology, and water chemistry."[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science#cite_note-37)
*   [Glaciology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaciology "Glaciology") covers the [icy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice") parts of the Earth (or [cryosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryosphere "Cryosphere")).
*   [Atmospheric sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_sciences "Atmospheric sciences") cover the [gaseous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas") parts of the Earth (or [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere")) between the surface and the [exosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere "Exosphere") (about 1000 km). Major subdisciplines include meteorology, climatology, [atmospheric chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_chemistry "Atmospheric chemistry"), and [atmospheric physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_physics "Atmospheric physics").
