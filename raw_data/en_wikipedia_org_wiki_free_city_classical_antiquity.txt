The status was given by the king or emperor, who nevertheless supervised the city's affairs through his epistates or curator (Greek: epimeletes ) respectively. Several autonomous cities had also the right to issue civic coinage bearing the name of the city.

History [ edit ] Examples of free cities include Amphipolis , which after 357 BC remained permanently a free and autonomous city inside the Macedonian kingdom ; [ 2 ] and probably also Cassandreia and Philippi .

Under Seleucid rule, numerous cities enjoyed autonomy and issued coins; some of them, like Seleucia and Tarsus continued to be free cities, even after the Roman conquest by Pompey .

Nicopolis was also constituted a free city by Augustus, its founder.

[ 3 ] Thessalonica after the battle of Philippi , was made a free city in 42 BC, when it had sided with the victors.

[ 4 ] Athens , a free city with its own laws, appealed to Hadrian to devise new laws which he modelled on those given by Draco and Solon .

[ 5 ] Autonomi [ 6 ] or rather Autonomoi was the name given by the Greeks to those states which were governed by their own laws, and were not subject to any foreign power.

[ 7 ] This name was also given to those cities subject to the Romans, which were permitted to enjoy their own laws, and elect their own magistrates.

[ 8 ] This permission was regarded as a great privilege, and mark of honour; and it is accordingly found recorded on coins and medals (e.g. Metropolis of the Antiochians autonomous).
