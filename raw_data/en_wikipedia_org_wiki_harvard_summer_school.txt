Students from American and foreign universities often enroll in the school to study for seven weeks with Harvard faculty as well as visiting scholars from other institutions. The Summer School does not offer any degrees but grants academic credits.

The Summer School offers more than 300 daytime and evening classes in over 60 disciplines.
