Viewing the set of all the maps as a space is useful because that allows for topological considerations. For example, a curve h : I → → Map ⁡ ⁡ ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle h:I\to \operatorname {Map} (X,Y)} in the mapping space is exactly a homotopy .

Topologies [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( November 2024 ) A mapping space can be equipped with several topologies. A common one is the compact-open topology . Typically, there is then the adjoint relation Map ⁡ ⁡ ( X × × Y , Z ) ≃ ≃ Map ⁡ ⁡ ( X , Map ⁡ ⁡ ( Y , Z ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Map} (X\times Y,Z)\simeq \operatorname {Map} (X,\operatorname {Map} (Y,Z))} and thus Map {\displaystyle \operatorname {Map} } is an analog of the Hom functor . (For pathological spaces, this relation may fail.) Smooth mappings [ edit ] For manifolds M , N {\displaystyle M,N} , there is the subspace C r ( M , N ) ⊂ ⊂ Map ⁡ ⁡ ( M , N ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}^{r}(M,N)\subset \operatorname {Map} (M,N)} that consists of all the C r {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}^{r}} -smooth maps from M {\displaystyle M} to N {\displaystyle N} . It can be equipped with the weak or strong topology.

A basic approximation theorem says that C W s ( M , N ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}_{W}^{s}(M,N)} is dense in C S r ( M , N ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}_{S}^{r}(M,N)} for 1 ≤ ≤ s ≤ ≤ ∞ ∞ , 0 ≤ ≤ r < s {\displaystyle 1\leq s\leq \infty ,0\leq r<s} .
