[ 1 ] A limiting case is a type of special case which is arrived at by taking some aspect of the concept to the extreme of what is permitted in the general case. If B is true, one can immediately deduce that A is true as well, and if B is false, A can also be immediately deduced to be false. A degenerate case is a special case which is in some way qualitatively different from almost all of the cases allowed.

Examples [ edit ] Special case examples include the following: All squares are rectangles (but not all rectangles are squares); therefore the square is a special case of the rectangle. It is also a special case of the rhombus .

If an isosceles triangle is defined as a triangle with at least 2 identical angles, an equilateral triangle is therefore a special case. (However, this is not true if an authority follows a different linguistic prescription of an isosceles triangle having exactly 2 sides.) Fermat's Last Theorem , that a n + b n = c n has no solutions in positive integers with n > 2 , is a special case of Beal's conjecture , that a x + b y = c z has no primitive solutions in positive integers with x , y , and z all greater than 2, specifically, the case of x = y = z .

The unproven Riemann hypothesis is a special case of the generalized Riemann hypothesis , in the case that χ ( n ) = 1 for all n.

Fermat's little theorem , which states "if p is a prime number, then for any integer a , then a p ≡ ≡ a ( mod p ) {\displaystyle a^{p}\equiv a{\pmod {p}}} " is a special case of Euler's theorem , which states "if n and a are coprime positive integers, and ϕ ϕ ( n ) {\displaystyle \phi (n)} is Euler's totient function , then a φ φ ( n ) ≡ ≡ 1 ( mod n ) {\displaystyle a^{\varphi (n)}\equiv 1{\pmod {n}}} ", in the case that n is a prime number.

Euler's identity e i π π = − − 1 {\displaystyle e^{i\pi }=-1} is a special case of Euler's formula which states "for any real number x : e i x = cos ⁡ ⁡ x + i sin ⁡ ⁡ x {\displaystyle e^{ix}=\cos x+i\sin x} ", in the case that x = π π {\displaystyle \pi } .
