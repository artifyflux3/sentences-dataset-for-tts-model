In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **plane** is a [two-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_space "Two-dimensional space") or [flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_space "Flat space")[surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)") that extends indefinitely. A plane is the two-dimensional analogue of a [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") (zero dimensions), a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") (one dimension) and [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"). When working exclusively in two-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), the definite article is used, so _the_[Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") refers to the whole space.

Several notions of a plane may be defined. The Euclidean plane follows [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), and in particular the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate"). A [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane") may be constructed by adding "points at infinity" where two otherwise parallel lines would intersect, so that every pair of lines intersects in exactly one point. The [elliptic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_plane "Elliptic plane") may be further defined by adding a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)") to the real projective plane. One may also conceive of a [hyperbolic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_plane "Hyperbolic plane"), which obeys [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry") and has a negative [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature").

Abstractly, one may forget all structure except the topology, producing the topological plane, which is homeomorphic to an [open disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_disk "Open disk"). Viewing the plane as an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") produces the [affine plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_plane "Affine plane"), which lacks a notion of distance but preserves the notion of [collinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity "Collinearity"). Conversely, in adding more structure, one may view the plane as a [1-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-dimensional "1-dimensional")[complex manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold"), called the [complex line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_line "Complex line").

Many fundamental tasks in mathematics, [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry"), [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory"), and [graphing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") are performed in a two-dimensional or _planar_ space.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics)#cite_note-Janich_Zook_1992_p._50-1)

### Embedding in three-dimensional space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plane_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Embedding in three-dimensional space")]

The elliptic plane is the [real projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane "Real projective plane") provided with a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)"). [Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler "Kepler") and [Desargues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues "Desargues") used the [gnomonic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomonic_projection "Gnomonic projection") to relate a plane σ to points on a [hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") tangent to it. With _O_ the center of the hemisphere, a point _P_ in σ determines a line _OP_ intersecting the hemisphere, and any line _L_ ⊂ σ determines a plane _OL_ which intersects the hemisphere in half of a [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle"). The hemisphere is bounded by a plane through O and parallel to σ. No ordinary line of _σ_ corresponds to this plane; instead a [line at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_at_infinity "Line at infinity") is appended to _σ_. As any line in this extension of σ corresponds to a plane through _O_, and since any pair of such planes intersects in a line through _O_, one can conclude that any pair of lines in the extension intersect: the point of intersection lies where the plane intersection meets σ or the line at infinity. Thus the axiom of projective geometry, requiring all pairs of lines in a plane to intersect, is confirmed.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics)#cite_note-2)

Given _P_ and _Q_ in _σ_, the elliptic distance between them is the measure of the angle _POQ_, usually taken in radians. [Arthur Cayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley "Arthur Cayley") initiated the study of elliptic geometry when he wrote "On the definition of distance".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics)#cite_note-3): 82  This venture into abstraction in geometry was followed by [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein") and [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann") leading to [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry") and [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry").

These parallel lines appear to intersect in the [vanishing point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_point "Vanishing point") "at infinity". In a projective plane this is actually true.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane") is a geometric structure that extends the concept of a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)"). In the ordinary Euclidean plane, two lines typically intersect at a single point, but there are some pairs of lines (namely, parallel lines) that do not intersect. A projective plane can be thought of as an ordinary plane equipped with additional "points at infinity" where parallel lines intersect. Thus _any_ two distinct lines in a projective plane intersect at exactly one point.

Renaissance artists, in developing the techniques of drawing in [perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)#Renaissance "Perspective (graphical)"), laid the groundwork for this mathematical topic. The archetypical example is the [real projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane "Real projective plane"), also known as the extended Euclidean plane.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics)#cite_note-4) This example, in slightly different guises, is important in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") and [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry") where it may be denoted variously by PG(2, R), RP 2, or P 2(R), among other notations. There are many other projective planes, both infinite, such as the [complex projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_projective_plane "Complex projective plane"), and finite, such as the [Fano plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane "Fano plane").

A projective plane is a 2-dimensional [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space"). Not all projective planes can be [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") in 3-dimensional projective spaces; such embeddability is a consequence of a property known as [Desargues' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues%27_theorem "Desargues' theorem"), not shared by all projective planes.

Further generalizations
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plane_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Further generalizations")]

In addition to its familiar [geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric "Geometric") structure, with [isomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") that are [isometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry") with respect to the usual inner product, the plane may be viewed at various other levels of [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(mathematics) "Abstraction (mathematics)"). Each level of abstraction corresponds to a specific [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(mathematics) "Category (mathematics)").

At one extreme, all geometrical and [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)") concepts may be dropped to leave the [topological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological "Topological") plane, which may be thought of as an idealized [homotopically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy "Homotopy") trivial infinite rubber sheet, which retains a notion of proximity, but has no distances. The topological plane has a concept of a linear path, but no concept of a straight line. The topological plane, or its equivalent the open disc, is the basic topological neighborhood used to construct [surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)") (or 2-manifolds) classified in [low-dimensional topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-dimensional_topology "Low-dimensional topology"). Isomorphisms of the topological plane are all [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function")[bijections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection"). The topological plane is the natural context for the branch of [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory") that deals with [planar graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graphs "Planar graphs"), and results such as the [four color theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem "Four color theorem").

The plane may also be viewed as an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"), whose isomorphisms are combinations of translations and non-singular linear maps. From this viewpoint there are no distances, but [collinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity "Collinearity") and ratios of distances on any line are preserved.

[Differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") views a plane as a 2-dimensional real [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"), a topological plane which is provided with a [differential structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_structure "Differential structure"). Again in this case, there is no notion of distance, but there is now a concept of smoothness of maps, for example a [differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function") or [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function") path (depending on the type of differential structure applied). The isomorphisms in this case are bijections with the chosen degree of differentiability.

In the opposite direction of abstraction, we may apply a compatible field structure to the geometric plane, giving rise to the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane") and the major area of [complex analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis "Complex analysis"). The complex field has only two isomorphisms that leave the real line fixed, the identity and [conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugation "Complex conjugation").

In the same way as in the real case, the plane may also be viewed as the simplest, [one-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional "One-dimensional") (in terms of [complex dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_dimension "Complex dimension"), over the complex numbers) [complex manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold"), sometimes called the [complex line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_line "Complex line"). However, this viewpoint contrasts sharply with the case of the plane as a 2-dimensional real manifold. The isomorphisms are all [conformal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map "Conformal map") bijections of the complex plane, but the only possibilities are maps that correspond to the composition of a multiplication by a complex number and a translation.

In addition, the Euclidean geometry (which has zero [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature") everywhere) is not the only geometry that the plane may have. The plane may be given a [spherical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry") by using the [stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection "Stereographic projection"). This can be thought of as placing a sphere tangent to the plane (just like a ball on the floor), removing the top point, and projecting the sphere onto the plane from this point. This is one of the projections that may be used in making a flat map of part of the Earth's surface. The resulting geometry has constant positive curvature.

Alternatively, the plane can also be given a metric which gives it constant negative curvature giving the [hyperbolic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"). The latter possibility finds an application in the theory of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") in the simplified case where there are two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. (The hyperbolic plane is a [timelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timelike "Timelike")[hypersurface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersurface "Hypersurface") in three-dimensional [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space").)

Topological and differential geometric notions
----------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plane_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Topological and differential geometric notions")]

The [one-point compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-point_compactification "One-point compactification") of the plane is homeomorphic to a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") (see [stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection "Stereographic projection")); the open disk is homeomorphic to a sphere with the "north pole" missing; adding that point completes the (compact) sphere. The result of this compactification is a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") referred to as the [Riemann sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere "Riemann sphere") or the [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers "Complex numbers")[projective line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_line "Projective line"). The projection from the Euclidean plane to a sphere without a point is a [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") and even a [conformal map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map "Conformal map").

The plane itself is homeomorphic (and diffeomorphic) to an open [disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)"). For the [hyperbolic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry") such diffeomorphism is conformal, but for the Euclidean plane it is not.

Similarly for projective or extended spaces of other dimensions.
