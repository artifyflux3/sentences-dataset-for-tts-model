The Fujita scale attempts to estimate the intensity of a tornado by classifying the damage caused to natural features and man-made structures in the tornado's path.

Tornadoes are among the most violent known meteorological phenomena. Each year, more than 2,000 tornadoes are recorded worldwide, with the vast majority occurring in North America and Europe.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] To assess the intensity of these events, meteorologist Ted Fujita devised a method to estimate maximum wind speeds within tornadic storms based on the damage caused; this became known as the Fujita scale . The scale ranks tornadoes from F0 to F5, with F0 being the least intense and F5 being the most intense. F4 tornadoes were estimated to have had maximum winds between 207 mph (333 km/h) and 260 mph (420 km/h).

[ 3 ] [ nb 1 ] Most of Europe also uses the TORRO tornado intensity scale (or T-Scale), which ranks tornado intensity between T0 and T11; F4 tornadoes are approximately equivalent to T8 to T9 on the T-Scale.
