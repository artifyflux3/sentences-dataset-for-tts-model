Niederreiter (born June 7, 1944) is an Austrian mathematician known for his work in discrepancy theory , algebraic geometry , quasi-Monte Carlo methods , and cryptography .

Education and career [ edit ] Niederreiter was born on June 7, 1944, in Vienna , and grew up in Salzburg .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He began studying mathematics at the University of Vienna in 1963, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and finished his doctorate there in 1969, with a thesis on discrepancy in compact abelian groups supervised by Edmund Hlawka .

[ 3 ] He began his academic career as an assistant professor at the University of Vienna, but soon moved to Southern Illinois University .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] During this period he also visited the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , Institute for Advanced Study , and University of California, Los Angeles .

[ 2 ] In 1978 he moved again, becoming the head of a new mathematics department at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica . In 1981 he returned to Austria for a post at the Austrian Academy of Sciences , where from 1989 to 2000 he served as director of the Institutes of Information Processing and Discrete Mathematics. In 2001 he became a professor at the National University of Singapore .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In 2009 he returned to Austria again, to the Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. He also worked from 2010 to 2011 as a professor at the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia .

[ 2 ] Research [ edit ] Niederreiter's initial research interests were in the abstract algebra of abelian groups and finite fields , subjects also represented by his later book Finite Fields (with Rudolf Lidl, 1983).

[ 1 ] From his doctoral thesis onwards, he also incorporated discrepancy theory and the theory of uniformly distributed sets in metric spaces into his study of these subjects.

[ 2 ] In 1970, Niederreiter began to work on numerical analysis and random number generation , and in 1974 he published the book Uniform Distribution of Sequences . Combining his work on pseudorandom numbers with the Monte Carlo method , he did pioneering research in the quasi-Monte Carlo method in the late 1970s, and again later published a book on the topic, Random Number Generation and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods (1995).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Niederreiter's interests in pseudorandom numbers also led him to study stream ciphers in the 1980s, and this interest branched out into other areas of cryptography such as public key cryptography . The Niederreiter cryptosystem , an encryption system based on error-correcting codes that can also be used for digital signatures , was developed by him in 1986.

[ 1 ] His work in cryptography is represented by his book Algebraic Geometry in Coding Theory and Cryptography (with C. P. Xing, 2009).

[ 2 ] Returning to pure mathematics, Niederreiter has also made contributions to algebraic geometry with the discovery of many dense curves over finite fields, [ 1 ] and published the book Rational Points on Curves over Finite Fields: Theory and Applications (with C. P. Xing, 2001).

[ 2 ] Awards and honors [ edit ] Niederreiter is a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina . In 1998 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians , [ 4 ] and won the Kardinal Innitzer Prize .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2013.

[ 2 ] Niederreiter's book Random Number Generation and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods won the Outstanding Simulation Publication Award.

[ 1 ] In 2014, a workshop in honor of Niederreiter's 70th birthday was held at the Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics of the Austrian Academy of Sciences , [ 5 ] and a Festschrift was published in his honor.
