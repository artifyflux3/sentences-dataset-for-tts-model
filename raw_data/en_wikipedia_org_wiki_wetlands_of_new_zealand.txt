New Zealand has several notable wetlands but 90% of wetland areas have been lost following European settlement.

The Resource Management Act 1991 , the major Act of Parliament determining land use, defines wetlands as "permanently or intermittently wet areas, shallow water, and land water margins that support a natural ecosystem of plants and animals that area adapted to wet conditions".  The Ramsar Convention , an international conservation agreement for wetlands to which New Zealand signed up to in 1971, has a wider definition of wetland.

[ 1 ] Since the mid-19th century, New Zealand has lost about 90% of its wetland areas due to draining for farming. Many remaining wetlands are also degraded due to pollution, grazing, drainage and presence of invasive plants . In the late 20th and early 21st century, efforts have been made towards wetland conservation .

[ 2 ] Ramsar sites [ edit ] The Department of Conservation currently administers seven Ramsar sites protected under the Ramsar Convention , covering an area of about 56,000 hectares (140,000 acres).

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Awarua Wetland Farewell Spit Firth of Thames Kopuatai Peat Dome Manawatu river mouth and estuary Wairarapa Moana Wetland Whangamarino Wetland Other wetlands [ edit ] Other notable wetlands in New Zealand include Ahukawakawa Swamp , Aramoana , the Kepler Mire , Kai Iwi Lakes , the Mangarakau Wetland , the Sinclair Wetlands , and Te Henga , as well as areas around the lower reaches of the Waikato River .

The Rakatu Wetlands in the South Island are part of an ecological restoration project set up address the environmental effects of the construction of the Manapouri Power Station .

Travis Wetland is a restoration project covering 116 hectares (290 acres) of land in urban Christchurch .
