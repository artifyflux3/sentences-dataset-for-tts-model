Ulm is located on the eastern edges of the Swabian Jura mountain range, on the upper course of the River Danube , at the confluence with the small Blau Stream , coming from the Blautopf in the west. The mouth of the Iller also falls within Ulm's city limits. The Danube forms the border with Bavaria , where Ulm's twin city Neu-Ulm lies. The city was part of Ulm until 1810, and Ulm and Neu-Ulm have a combined population of around 190,000. Ulm forms an urban district of its own ( Stadtkreis Ulm ), and is the administrative seat of the Alb-Donau-Kreis , the district that surrounds it on three sides, but which the city itself is not a part of. Ulm is the overall 11th-largest city on the river Danube , and the third-largest German Danubian city after Regensburg and Ingolstadt .

Founded around 850, Ulm is rich in history and traditions as a former free imperial city . Ulm is an economic centre due to its varied industries, and is the seat of the University of Ulm ( Universität Ulm ), and of the Ulm University of Applied Sciences ( Technische Hochschule Ulm [ de ] , THU). The city lies on the international railway corridor " Main Line for Europe ", from Paris to Bratislava and Budapest , via Strasbourg , Karlsruhe , Stuttgart , Ulm, Augsburg , Munich , Salzburg , Linz and Vienna . The Ulm Minster ( Ulmer Münster ) is the tallest church in the world (161.53 m or 529.95 ft).

In 1927, the then tiny village of Wiblingen was incorporated into Ulm, which led to that Wiblingen Abbey with its monastic library and its True Cross reliquary ( Heilig-Kreuz-Reliquie ), that allegedly contains wood particles from the True Cross , is now part of Ulm.

Famous personalities born in Ulm include Johann Georg Niederegger [ de ] (1777–1859), Karl Heinrich Kässbohrer [ de ] (1864–1922), Albert Einstein (1879–1955), Otto Kässbohrer (1904–1989), Hildegard Knef (1925–2002) and Ursula Karven (b.1964).

Geography [ edit ] View from Ulm Minster towards Hirschstraße Ulm lies at the point where the rivers Blau and Iller join the Danube , at an altitude of 479 m (1,571.52 ft) above sea level . Most parts of the city, including the old town, are situated on the northern bank of the Danube; only the districts of Wiblingen, Gögglingen, Donaustetten and Unterweiler lie on the southern bank. Across from the old town, on the other side of the river, lies the twin city of Neu-Ulm in the state of Bavaria , smaller than Ulm and, until 1810, a part of it (population c. 50,000).

Except for the Danube in the south, the city is surrounded by forests and hills which rise to altitudes of over 620 metres (2,034.12 feet), some of them part of the Swabian Alb . South of the Danube, plains and hills finally end in the northern edge of the Alps , which are approximately 100 kilometres (62 miles) from Ulm and are visible from the city on clear days.

The city of Ulm is situated in the northern part of the North Alpine Foreland basin , where the basin reaches the Swabian Alb. The Turritellenplatte of Ermingen ("Erminger Turritellenplatte") is a famous palaeontological site of Burdigalian age.

Neighboring communes [ edit ] Ulm in the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle On the right (south-eastern) side of Danube and Iller there is the Bavarian district town Neu-Ulm . On the left (north-western) side Ulm is almost completely surrounded by the Alb-Danube district. The neighbouring communes of Baden-Württemberg are the following: Illerkirchberg , Staig , Hüttisheim , Erbach (Donau) , Blaubeuren , Blaustein , Dornstadt , Beimerstetten and Langenau as well as the eastern neighbouring community Elchingen .

Town subdivisions [ edit ] The city is divided into 18 districts ( German : Stadtteile [ de ] ): Ulm-Mitte, Böfingen, Donaustetten, Donautal, Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, Eselsberg, Gögglingen, Grimmelfingen, Jungingen, Lehr, Mähringen, Oststadt, Söflingen (with Harthausen), Unterweiler, Weststadt, and Wiblingen.

Nine districts were integrated during the latest municipality reform in the 1970s: Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, Gögglingen-Donaustetten, Jungingen, Lehr, Mähringen und Unterweiler. They have their own local councils which acquire an important consulting position to the whole city council concerning issues that are related to the prevailing districts. But at the end, final decisions can only be made by the city council of the entire city of Ulm.

History [ edit ] See also: Free Imperial City of Ulm Ulm in 1572 by Frans Hogenberg The oldest traceable settlement of the Ulm area began in the early Neolithic period, around 5000 BC. Settlements of this time have been identified at the villages of Eggingen and Lehr, today districts of the city. In the city area of Ulm proper, the oldest find dates from the late Neolithic period. The earliest written mention of Ulm is dated 22 July 854 AD, when King Louis the German signed a document in the King's palace of "Hulma" in the Duchy of Swabia .

[ 3 ] The city was declared an Imperial City (German: Reichsstadt ) by Friedrich Barbarossa in 1181.

At first, Ulm's significance was due to the privilege of a Königspfalz , a place of accommodation for the medieval German kings and emperors on their frequent travels. Later, Ulm became a city of traders and craftsmen. One of the most important legal documents of the city, an agreement between the Ulm patricians and the trade guilds (German: Großer Schwörbrief ), dates from 1397. This document, considered an early city constitution, and the beginning of the construction of an enormous church ( Ulm Minster , 1377), financed by the inhabitants of Ulm themselves rather than by the church, demonstrate the assertiveness of Ulm's medieval citizens. Ulm blossomed during the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly due to the export of high-quality textiles. The city was situated at the crossroads of important trade routes extending to Italy. These centuries, during which many important buildings were erected, also represented the zenith of art in Ulm, especially for painters and sculptors like Hans Multscher and Jörg Syrlin the Elder . During the Reformation , Ulm became Protestant (1530). With the establishment of new trade routes following the discovery of the New World (16th century) and the outbreak and consequences of the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), the city began to decline gradually. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), it was alternately invaded several times by French and Bavarian soldiers.

The capitulation of Ulm. General Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered to Napoleon .

In the wars following the French Revolution , the city was alternately occupied by French and Austrian forces, with the former ones destroying the city fortifications. In 1803, it lost the status of Imperial City and was absorbed into Bavaria . During the campaign of 1805, Napoleon managed to trap the invading Austrian army of General Mack and forced it to surrender in the Battle of Ulm . In 1810, Ulm was incorporated into the Kingdom of Württemberg and lost its districts on the other bank of the Danube, which came to be known as Neu-Ulm (New Ulm).

In the mid-19th century, the city was designated a fortress of the German Confederation with huge military construction works directed primarily against the threat of a French invasion. The city became an important centre of industrialisation in southern Germany in the second half of the 19th century, its built-up area now being extended beyond the medieval walls. The construction of the huge minster, which had been interrupted in the 16th century for economic reasons, was resumed and eventually finished (1844–1891) in a wave of German national enthusiasm for the Middle Ages .

From 1933 to 1935, a concentration camp primarily for political opponents of the regime was established on the Kuhberg, one of the hills surrounding Ulm. The Jews of Ulm, around 500 people, were first discriminated against and later persecuted; their synagogue was torn down during Kristallnacht in November 1938. Of 116 Jews deported from Ulm during World War II (45 were sent to Theresienstadt on 22 August 1942), only four returned.

[ 4 ] Approximately 25 Jews were living in Ulm in 1968.

The sole RAF strategic bombing during World War II against Ulm occurred on 17 December 1944, against the two large lorry factories of Magirus -Deutz and Kässbohrer , as well as other industries, barracks, and depots in Ulm. The Gallwitz Barracks and several military hospitals were among 14 Wehrmacht establishments destroyed.

[ 5 ] The raid killed 707 Ulm inhabitants and left 25,000 homeless and after all the bombings, over 80% of the medieval city centre lay in ruins. The Magirus factory hosted a subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp .

[ 6 ] Some parts of the city were rebuilt in the plain and simple style of the 1950s and 1960s, but most parts of the historic old town have been restored.

[ 7 ] Due to its almost complete destruction in 1944, the Hirschstraße part of the city primarily consists of modern architecture. Ulm experienced substantial growth in the decades following World War II, with the establishment of large new housing projects and new industrial zones. In 1967, Ulm University was founded, which proved to be of great importance for the development of the city. Particularly since the 1980s, the transition from classical industry towards the high-tech sector has accelerated, with, for example, the establishment of research centres of companies like Daimler , Siemens and Nokia and a number of small applied research institutes near the university campus. The city today is still growing, forming a twin city of 170,000 inhabitants together with its neighbouring Bavarian city of Neu-Ulm , and seems to benefit from its central position between the cities of Stuttgart and Munich and thus between the cultural and economic hubs of southern Germany.

Economy [ edit ] Saint George 's Catholic church, Ulm The city has very old trading traditions dating from medieval times and a long history of industrialisation, beginning with the establishment of a railway station in 1850. The most important sector is still classical industry (machinery, especially motor vehicles; electronics ; pharmaceuticals ). The establishment of the University of Ulm in 1967, which focuses on biomedicine , the sciences, and engineering, helped support a transition to high-tech industry, especially after the crisis of classical industries in the 1980s.
