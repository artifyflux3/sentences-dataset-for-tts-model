To the southeast is the crater Encke . Kepler is named for the 17th century German astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler .

[ 1 ] Description [ edit ] Kepler is most notable for the prominent ray system that covers the surrounding mare . The rays extend for well over 300 kilometers, overlapping the rays from other craters. Kepler has a small rampart of ejecta surrounding the exterior of its high rim. The outer wall is not quite circular, and possesses a slightly polygonal form. The interior walls of Kepler are slumped and slightly terraced , descending to an uneven floor and a minor central rise.

One of the rays from Tycho , when extended across the Oceanus Procellarum , intersects this crater. This was a factor in the choice of the crater's name when Giovanni Riccioli was creating his system of lunar nomenclature , as Kepler used the observations of Tycho Brahe while devising his three laws of planetary motion. On Riccioli's maps, this crater was named Keplerus , and the surrounding skirt of higher albedo terrain was named Insulara Ventorum .

Due to its prominent rays, Kepler is mapped as part of the Copernican System .
