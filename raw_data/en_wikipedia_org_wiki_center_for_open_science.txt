[ 1 ] Brian Nosek and  Jeffrey Spies founded the organization in January 2013, funded mainly by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation and others.

[ 2 ] The organization began with work in reproducibility of psychology research, with the large-scale initiative Reproducibility Project: Psychology .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] A second reproducibility project for cancer biology research has also been started through a partnership with Science Exchange .

[ 6 ] In March 2017, the Center published a detailed strategic plan.

[ 7 ] Brian Nosek posted a letter outlining the history of the Center and future directions.

[ 8 ] In 2020, the Center received a grant from Fast Grants to promote the publication of COVID-19 research on the platform.

[ 9 ] In 2021, the Center for Open Science was honored with the Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research [ de ] in the institutional category for their contribution to fostering research integrity and to improving transparency and accessibility.

[ 10 ] Open Science Framework [ edit ] Reproducibility project [ edit ] The Open Science Framework (OSF) is an open source software project that facilitates open collaboration in science research. The framework was initially used to work on a project in the reproducibility of psychology research, [ 11 ] [ 12 ] but has subsequently become multidisciplinary.

[ 13 ] The current reproducibility aspect of the project is a crowdsourced empirical investigation of the reproducibility of a variety of studies from psychological literature, sampling from three major journals: Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , Psychological Science , and Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition . Scientists volunteer to replicate a study of their choosing from these journals, and follow a structured protocol for designing and conducting a high-powered replication of the key effect. The results were published in 2015.

[ 14 ] Preprints [ edit ] In 2016, OSF started three new preprint services: engrXiv , SocArXiv , and (with the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science) PsyArXiv .

[ 15 ] It subsequently opened its own preprint server in 2017, OSF Preprints.

[ 16 ] Its unified search function includes preprints from OSF Preprints, alongside those from other servers such as Preprints.org , Thesis Commons , PeerJ , and multiple ArXiv repositories.
