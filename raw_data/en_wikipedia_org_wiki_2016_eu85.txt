Discovery date 10 March 2016 (discovery: first observation only) Designations MPC designation 2016 EU 85 Minor planet category Apollo NEO PHA [ 1 ] Orbital characteristics [ 1 ] Epoch 4 September 2017 ( JD 2458000.5) Uncertainty parameter 3 Observation arc 1.42 yr (518 days) Aphelion 2.7400 AU Perihelion 0.9561 AU Semi-major axis 1.8480 AU Eccentricity 0.4826 Orbital period (sidereal) 2.51 yr (918 days) Mean anomaly 303.30 ° Mean motion 0° 23 m 32.28 s / day Inclination 2.5966° Longitude of ascending node 359.44° Argument of perihelion 23.527° Earth MOID 0.0065 AU (2.5 LD ) Physical characteristics Dimensions 0.4 km (est. at 0.24 ) [ 3 ] Absolute magnitude (H) 19.2 [ 1 ] 2016 EU 85 is an asteroid , classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group , approximately 400 meters in diameter. It was first observed on 10 March 2016, by the Pan-STARRS survey at Haleakala Observatory , Hawaii, United States.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Orbit [ edit ] 2016 EU 85 orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0–2.7 AU once every 2 years and 6 months (918 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.48 and an inclination of 3 ° with respect to the ecliptic .

[ 1 ] It has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of 0.0065 AU (972,000 km) which translates into 2.5 lunar distances .

[ 1 ] Torino scale [ edit ] It is currently rated at level 0 [ 4 ] after being rated at level 1 on the Torino Scale by the NEODyS system.

[ 5 ] It was upgraded to level 1 on 25 March 2016 but downgraded on 30 March 2016. On the Sentry system it did not cross the threshold between the two levels, due to a lower computed impact probability. The asteroid is estimated to have a diameter of 440 metres (1,440 ft; 480 yd).

[ 6 ] The observation arc was then increased to of 78 days.

[ 7 ] When rated at Torino Scale level 1, there was a 0.0012% chance or a 1 in 83,000 chance of the asteroid colliding with the Earth , corresponding to a 99.9988% chance the asteroid will miss the Earth.

[ 8 ] 2016 EU 85 had been observed 14 times [ 9 ] at the observatories Mauna Kea ( 568 ), Apache Point ( 705 ), Pan-STARRS 1 Haleakala ( F51 ) and Magdalena Ridge Observatory ( H01 ).

[ 10 ] 2016 EU 85 was subsequently removed from the list of possible impactors thanks to prediscovery observations found in the Pan-STARRS archive.

Observations [ edit ] 2016 EU85 was observed with the Spacewatch 1.8-meter telescopes and also the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope .
