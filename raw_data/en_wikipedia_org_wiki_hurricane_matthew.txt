The deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Stan in 2005 , and the first Category 5 Atlantic hurricane since Felix in 2007 , Matthew was the thirteenth named storm , fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season . It caused extensive damage to landmasses in the Greater Antilles , and severe damage in several islands of the Bahamas which were still recovering from Joaquin , which had pounded the archipelago nearly a year earlier. Matthew also approached the southeastern United States, but stayed just offshore, paralleling the Florida coastline.

Originating from a tropical wave that emerged off Africa on September 22, Matthew developed into a tropical storm just east of the Lesser Antilles on September 28. It became a hurricane north of Venezuela and Colombia on September 29, before undergoing explosive intensification , ultimately reaching Category 5 intensity on October 1 with peak 1-minute sustained winds of 165 mph. This strength was attained at just 13.4°N latitude – the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the Atlantic basin, breaking the record set by Hurricane Ivan in 2004.

[ 1 ] Matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the Greater Antilles , remaining a strong Category 4 hurricane as it made its first landfall over Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4, and then a second one in Cuba later that day. Matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest, making landfall in the northern Bahamas . The storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern United States over the next 36 hours, gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge near McClellanville , South Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane on the morning of October 8. Matthew re-emerged into the Atlantic shortly afterward, eventually completing its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it turned away from Cape Hatteras , North Carolina on October 9. The remnants of Matthew continued to accelerate towards Canada where it was absorbed by a cold front.

[ 2 ] Widespread effects were felt from Matthew across its destructive path, however, the most significant impacts were felt in Haiti , with US$ 2.8 billion in damage and 674 deaths, making Matthew the worst disaster to affect the nation since the 2010 earthquake . The combination of flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land; around 80% of Jérémie sustained significant damage. Four people were killed in Cuba due to a bridge collapse, and total losses in the country amounted to US$2.58 billion, most of which occurred in the Guantánamo Province. Passing through the Bahamas as a major hurricane, Matthew spread damage across several islands.

Grand Bahama was hit directly, where most homes sustained damage in the townships of Eight Mile Rock and Holmes Rock. Preparations began in earnest across the southeastern United States as Matthew approached, with several states declaring states of emergencies for either entire states or coastal counties; widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast because of predicted high wind speeds and flooding, especially in the Jacksonville Metropolitan Area. In Florida, over 1 million lost power as the storm passed to the east, with 478,000 losing power in Georgia and South Carolina. While damage was primarily confined to the coast in Florida and Georgia, torrential rains spread inland in the Carolinas and Virginia , causing widespread flooding.

Meteorological history Main article: Meteorological history of Hurricane Matthew Map plotting the storm's track and intensity, according to the Saffir–Simpson scale Map key Saffir–Simpson scale Tropical depression (≤38 mph, ≤62 km/h) Tropical storm (39–73 mph, 63–118 km/h) Category 1 (74–95 mph, 119–153 km/h) Category 2 (96–110 mph, 154–177 km/h) Category 3 (111–129 mph, 178–208 km/h) Category 4 (130–156 mph, 209–251 km/h) Category 5 (≥157 mph, ≥252 km/h) Unknown Storm type Tropical cyclone Subtropical cyclone Extratropical cyclone , remnant low, tropical disturbance, or monsoon depression A vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 22 and moved rapidly across the Atlantic, being monitored by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for possible tropical cyclogenesis . Despite possessing tropical-storm winds as it approached the Lesser Antilles on September 27, the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone, as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center. However, by 12:00 UTC on September 28, the wave developed a closed circulation while located near Barbados , hence becoming a tropical storm, and was assigned the name Matthew . Continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge, the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18:00 UTC on September 29. The effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day, and Matthew began a period of explosive intensification ; during a 24-hour period beginning at 00:00 UTC on September 30, the cyclone's maximum winds more than doubled, from 80 to 165 mph (129 to 266 km/h), making Matthew a Category 5 hurricane, [ 1 ] the first since Felix in 2007; [ 3 ] the rate of intensification has only been exceeded a few times in the Atlantic since records began. Due to upwelling of cooler waters, Matthew weakened to a Category 4 hurricane later on October 1, before attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 155 mph (249 km/h) late on October 2.

[ 1 ] Slowly rounding the ridge, Matthew fluctuated in intensity within the Category 4 range from October 1–5. Intensification resumed again late on October 3 and culminated when Matthew made landfall near Les Anglais , Haiti , around 11:00 UTC on October 4 with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 934 millibars (27.6 inHg), making it the strongest to hit Haiti since Cleo in 1964. Continuing northward, the hurricane struck Maisí in Cuba early on October 5 as a slightly weaker storm. Cuba's and Haiti's mountainous terrain weakened Matthew to Category 3 status, as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the Bahamas . Restrengthening occurred as Matthew's circulation became better organized, with the storm becoming a Category 4 hurricane again while passing Freeport . However, Matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place. The storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of Florida and Georgia, the western portion of the outer eyewall came ashore in Florida as a Category 3 hurricane, while the inner eyewall remained just offshore. Matthew weakened to a Category 2 hurricane late on October 7 and then to a Category 1 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on October 8.

Around 15:00 UTC on October 8, the hurricane made landfall at Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge , near McClellanville, South Carolina , with winds of 85 mph (137 km/h) and a central pressure of 963 mbar (28.4 inHg), which made it the strongest to strike the United States in terms of pressure since Irene in 2011, and the first hurricane to make landfall north of Florida in October since Hurricane Hazel in 1954.

[ nb 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 1 ] Convection became displaced from the center as Matthew pulled away from land due to increasing wind shear, with the NHC declaring the system an extratropical cyclone about 200 mi (320 km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina , on October 9. The remnants persisted for another day, before they were absorbed by a cold front .

[ 1 ] Records Matthew set several records during its long and destructive journey. Matthew intensified into a Category 5 hurricane at a latitude of 13.4 degrees north, breaking the record set by Ivan in 2004, which had reached that intensity at a latitude of 13.7 degrees north.

[ 1 ] Matthew also maintained at least Category 4 status for the longest duration on record for the month of October, according to Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University , doing so for roughly 5 days.

[ 29 ] Haiti The animation shows Hurricane Matthew from September 28 to October 2, and 3-dimensional radar data from GPM's DPR instrument.

Though forecast to pass over Jamaica at the time, the large extent of tropical storm-force winds prompted the issuance of a tropical storm watch for Haiti 's Tiburon Peninsula toward the border with the Dominican Republic .

[ 20 ] Following an eastward shift in Matthew's predicted track, a hurricane watch was issued for much of Haiti on October 1, encompassing areas from Môle-Saint-Nicolas south to the Dominican Republic border; [ 30 ] this was upgraded to a warning just hours later.

[ 21 ] The warning eventually encompassed the entire country by the afternoon of October 2.

[ 31 ] Residents on outlying islands of Haiti were evacuated to the mainland.

[ 32 ] Life-threatening rainfall was forecast to affect much of the nation, [ 33 ] with accumulations averaging 15 to 25 in (38 to 64 cm) along the southern coast with isolated peaks up to 40 in (100 cm).

[ 34 ] Although government officials held meetings on storm preparation, Radio France Internationale reported that Haiti does not have the logistical capability to handle a large-scale disaster. Only 576 shelters, with a collective capacity of 90,000 people, were listed for all of southern Haiti.

[ 35 ] According to the International Organization for Migration , 55,107 internally displaced persons remained in camps or hosting sites without adequate protection from the hurricane.

[ 37 ] Despite pleas from officials, many residents refused to leave their homes.

[ 38 ] Schools were closed for October 3–4, though government offices remained open.

[ 37 ] Nationwide, a total of 1,300 shelters were readied with a total capacity of 390,000 people. More than 18,000 volunteers and members of the Red Cross, community intervention teams, municipal committees, and local emergency services were readied to assist residents.

[ 39 ] At least 500 people were evacuated from Jérémie .

[ 40 ] Although civil protection officials took to the streets to warn people, many residents were unaware that Matthew was even approaching the country a day before its expected landfall.

[ 41 ] Evacuations continued through the hurricane's landfall with the total number of people in shelters reaching 9,280 by 2:00 a.m. local time on October 4.

[ 42 ] On October 5, the Electoral Provisional Council postponed the presidential election , the second round of the legislative elections and the first round of the Senate elections until November 20.

[ 43 ] Dominican Republic On the morning of October 2, a tropical storm warning was raised for the southern coast of the Dominican Republic from Barahona west to the Haitian border, and a tropical storm watch was issued for the northern coast from Puerto Plata west to the Haitian border.

[ 44 ] At least 8,500 people were evacuated in southwestern areas of the country by the morning of October 3.

[ 40 ] Cuba and the Bahamas Annotated animation of Hurricane Matthew moving through the Bahamas on October 5–6 The Meteorological Service of Cuba raised hurricane watches for all of southeastern Cuba on October 1, encompassing the provinces of Camagüey , Las Tunas , Granma , Holguín , Santiago de Cuba , and Guantánamo .

[ 21 ] This was subsequently upgraded to a warning on October 2 for all provinces except Camagüey.

[ 53 ] On October 5, Port Canaveral was closed by the U.S. Coast Guard, the first closure since 2004. Eight cruise ships and four cargo ships were scheduled to visit the port between October 5–9.

[ 54 ] On Cape Canaveral, home to both civilian and military spaceflight facilities, no rockets or spacecraft were in vulnerable positions; at the time of Matthew's approach, the next launch was scheduled for November 4.

[ 55 ] The Kennedy Space Center began preparations of the facilities on October 5. Older buildings at the KSC were designed to withstand winds of 105–125 mph (169–201 km/h); buildings constructed after 1992, when Category 5 Hurricane Andrew struck the Miami area, are built to withstand 130 mph (210 km/h) winds.

[ 56 ] At Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , the U.S. Air Force's 45th Space Wing began disconnecting electric power to non-essential facilities on October 4.

[ 55 ] Enhanced infrared satellite loop of Matthew passing east of Florida on October 7 For the fourth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort closed. Its theme parks , Magic Kingdom , Epcot , Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disney's Animal Kingdom , as well as water parks Disney's Blizzard Beach , Disney's Typhoon Lagoon , and Disney Springs , were closed at 5:00 p.m.

Eastern Daylight Time on October 6, and remained closed on October 7.

[ 57 ] This was the first time since 2004 that the parks have closed, all instances due to hurricanes. Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando resort and SeaWorld Orlando , also closed.

[ 58 ] The Southeastern Conference football game between LSU and Florida , scheduled for October 8 in Gainesville, was cancelled, while the SEC football game between Georgia and South Carolina , scheduled for October 8 in Columbia, was moved to October 9. The hurricane washed out NASCAR racing at Charlotte Motor Speedway on October 7 and 8, with the Drive for the Cure 300 race in the Xfinity Series originally scheduled for October 7 and the Bank of America 500 race in the Sprint Cup Series originally scheduled for October 8 both postponed until October 9.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] On October 6, U.S. President Barack Obama declared a federal state of emergency for Florida, [ 61 ] later extending to include Georgia and South Carolina.

[ 62 ] Florida's governor Rick Scott urged over 1.5 million people to evacuate, [ 63 ] with Hurricane Matthew expected to make landfall by the evening of that day.

[ 64 ] Several news anchors also issued dire warnings urging Floridians to evacuate.

[ 65 ] That same day, Georgia governor Nathan Deal ordered a mandatory evacuation for all areas of the state east of Interstate 95 , and the Georgia Department of Public Safety reversed the eastbound lanes on a portion of Interstate 16 effective until the following day.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] Online response On October 6, the conservative news aggregator Drudge Report —run by Matt Drudge —headlined a five-word comment on Matthew: "Storm Fizzle? Matthew Looks Ragged!" which linked to a Miami Herald article.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] Drudge later used Twitter to claim that the National Hurricane Center was lying to the public about the intensity of the storm, stating that measurements from Nassau, Bahamas, did not match the 165 mph (266 km/h) gusts listed in public advisories. The tweets implied that the hurricane was not as dangerous as it seemed and that politicians were trying to " blame mankind ," [ 70 ] referring to a blog posting about Hillary Clinton.

[ 70 ] This came on the heels of radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh 's claims of the conspiracy to "sell" climate change.

[ 71 ] The claims of conspiracy were posted as Matthew posed a dire threat to Florida's east coast and when residents across the state were being urged to evacuate immediately.

[ 72 ] Drudge's commentary was quickly met with sharp condemnation and criticism from meteorologists and public officials. Democratic Representative Keith Ellison called the comments "irresponsible" and urged people to "not listen to this man." [ 70 ] Jason Samenow of The Washington Post described it as an "incredible and offensive accusation", and stated that it "may have introduced enough doubt to lead [residents] into a decision they will regret."

One person was killed in the town of Layou when a boulder broke loose.

[ 8 ] In nearby Buccament Bay, a river overtopped its banks, prompting at least 25 people to evacuate to emergency shelters. The Hermitage River rose by at least 3.6 ft (1.1 m) in one hour, and as a precautionary measure, the Central Water and Sewage Authority shut off all water service. Flooding also took place in Vermont, South Rivers, sections of Kingstown, Campden Park, Arnos Vale, and Langley Park. Debris deposited by flooded rivers rendered many roads impassable.

[ 9 ] Strong winds in excess of 60 mph (97 km/h) downed many trees and power lines on St. Lucia , leaving roughly 70 percent of the island without power. Landslides and flooding, the result of more than 10 in (250 mm) of rain accompanying the storm, damaged many homes and roads.

[ 8 ] Rainfall at Hewanorra International Airport amounted to 13.19 in (335 mm).

[ 81 ] The nation's banana crop suffered significant damage; 85 percent of farms reported losses. Two homes were destroyed, one in Bisee, and one in Gros Islet; several others were damaged. Roads in Castries, Gros-Islet, Dennery, and Soufriere became impassible from debris or landslides.

[ 10 ] Some damage was also reported on Dominica , temporarily leaving many people without water and electricity.

[ 8 ] Heavy rainfall in Grenada disrupted the water supply in multiple communities.

[ 82 ] In Martinique strong winds, which gusted up to 89 mph (143 km/h) in Saint-Pierre , [ 81 ] wreaked havoc on the power grid; roughly 55,000 people lost electricity. Numerous trees downed by the winds blocked roadways while heavy rains led to flooding. The main road from Fort-de-France to southern towns was rendered impassable during the storm. Approximately 4,000 people lost their water supply. Three people sustained minor injuries.

[ 83 ] ABC islands and South America The effects of Matthew across the ABC islands were relatively limited despite its proximity. Some street flooding occurred on Aruba and Curaçao. Heavy winds were also experienced. There was some damage to cars after street flooding occurred. Outdoor bars and restaurants were damaged.

[ 15 ] The Guajira Peninsula of Colombia saw its first heavy rain event in three years, leading to widespread flash flooding. One person drowned in a swollen river in Uribia ; [ 18 ] 1.29 in (32.8 mm) of rain fell in 30 minutes in the town.

[ 84 ] Rainfall in Cartagena reached 8.7 in (222 mm) during a 24-hour span and Santa Marta saw 5.5 in (140 mm).

[ 85 ] Along coastal areas of the peninsula, large swells damaged buildings, prompting the evacuation of 380 people in Manaure .

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Roughly 70 percent of Tucurinca flooded when the Magdalena River overtopped its banks; a nearby bridge collapsed, isolating some communities.

[ 86 ] Approximately 73,000 people were affected by the floods.

[ 85 ] The dangerous conditions produced by Matthew prevented thousands of people from voting in a peace agreement referendum .

[ 87 ] Jamaica Jamaica suffered relatively minor effects, characteristic of tropical storm conditions. Along the coast, rip currents and beach erosion was reported, with additional flooding due to rainfall occurring. Strong wind gusts tore at the island's vegetation, causing minor damage.

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] Haiti Main article: Effects of Hurricane Matthew in Haiti Hurricane Matthew approaching Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba on October 3 Matthew making landfall in Haiti Large swells reached the outlying Haitian island of Île-à-Vache on October 2, prompting the evacuation of 89 people.

[ 90 ] Despite boating bans, many fishermen continued work in rough conditions. Consequently, two fishermen went missing on the morning of October 3: one near Saint-Jean-du-Sud and the other near Aquin ; one was later found dead.

[ 41 ] Antecedent rainfall associated with the outer bands of Matthew triggered flooding in several towns in southern Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

[ 40 ] A person was killed when a tree fell on his home in Port Salut , while a 26-year-old man drowned while trying to rescue a child from a rushing river.

[ 91 ] Striking the Tiburon Peninsula as a Category 4 hurricane on the morning of October 4, Matthew was the strongest storm to directly impact Haiti since Hurricane Cleo in 1964. An anemometer at Antoine-Simon Airport in Les Cayes , east of where Matthew made landfall, measured a gust of 107 mph (172 km/h) before the station went offline. Gusts in the nation's capital city of Port-au-Prince reached 60 mph (97 km/h).

[ 92 ] Communications with areas in the direct path of Matthew were lost, and tens of thousands of people became isolated as roads and bridges were destroyed. A major bridge connecting parts of Grand'Anse to the rest of the country collapsed during a flash flood. 80% of Jérémie , [ 93 ] along the north shore of the Tiburon Peninsula, suffered tremendous damage; homes were flattened and medical facilities suffered major damage. A radio host in Port-au-Prince stated that Jérémie was "pretty much wiped out from the seaboard all the way to the cathedral".

[ 94 ] Officially, 546 deaths were attributed to the storm in Haiti, [ 1 ] however local governments believed the death toll to be over 1,000; this value may have been overestimated.

[ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] According to the nation's Civil Protection Directorate, the death toll was 546 as of October 14, with 128 people missing and 439 injured.

[ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 100 ] The government initially estimated damages at around 124 billion gourdes (US$1.9 billion), [ 1 ] [ 101 ] but later research found that the actual damages were up to $2.8 billion.

[ 80 ] Approximately 2.1 million people were affected by the storm, of whom 1.4 million (12 percent of Haiti's population) were left in need of assistance. Furthermore, roughly 175,000 people were left homeless.

[ 79 ] Dominican Republic The Dominican Republic reported significant rainfall and coastal flooding due to Matthew. An automated weather station in Cabo Rojo measured 8.43 in (214 mm) of rain by the afternoon of October 3.

[ 102 ] Four people died after a house collapsed on top of them.

[ 76 ] Damage of the flooding were about RD$ 20 billion (US$434 million).

Matthew's post-tropical remains were absorbed into a frontal zone off the coast of North Carolina. The humidity of the tropical system was drawn into the storm that was formed then. The latter gave heavy rain and strong winds in Nova Scotia , Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland from October 10 to 11.

In Nova Scotia, rain amounts were recorded from east to west as 8.85 in (224.8 mm) in Sydney ( Cape Breton Island ), 5.09 in (129.2 mm) in Port Hawkesbury , 4.50 in (114.4 mm) in Chéticamp , 4.05 in (102.8 mm) in Halifax , 3.263 in (82.88 mm) in Kentville, and 1.94 in (49.2 mm) in Yarmouth .

[ 153 ] Heavy rains and strong winds caused flooding and dangerous conditions, particularly in the counties of Pictou, Antigonish, Guysborough and Cape Breton. Several roads were closed to heavy trucks, including Halifax Harbour bridges and the Confederation Bridge between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

[ 153 ] Newfoundland was even more affected with accumulations generally ranging from 3.9 to 5.9 in (100 to 150 mm) in the central, southern and western areas.

USS Mesa Verde and USS George Washington were later relieved by USS Iwo Jima , along with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit .

United States Southern Command also deployed 100 troops with 9 helicopters to the Cayman Islands to prepare for relief work.

[ 158 ] Initial estimates indicated at least 350,000 people were in need of assistance.

[ 94 ] The bridge between the south and Port-au-Prince was destroyed. As a result, aid agencies reported they were having difficulty getting around to the most damaged and storm-affected parts of Haiti.

[ 159 ] The commander of U.S. forces in the Caribbean reported that troops and 6 helicopters from Joint Task Force-Bravo had been deployed to Haiti for the aftermath, and were expected to arrive on October 6. These are expected to help with search-and-rescue missions as well as providing medical assistance. In addition to his, a one-star navy admiral will also travel to lead the task force involved in the operations. More than 300 military personnel will most likely travel to Haiti, with 300 Marines on board on the ships sent out for aid from the U.S.

[ 160 ] A number of aid agencies deployed to Haiti to help with the aftermath: [ 161 ] Action Aid reported that over 50,000 people were in immediate need of clean water and shelters.

[ 164 ] Cuba The World Food Programme coordinated with the Government of Cuba to provide food to approximately 180,000 people in need across eastern provinces. The operation would span six months and cost US$4 million.

[ 165 ] Dominican Republic The EU Caribbean Investment Facility and a €50 million loan from the European Investment Bank will finance the reconstruction of housing, but also other essential infrastructure lost including roads, bridges and urban infrastructure.

Climate resilience will be improve through infrastructure being built to higher standards and through flood prevention and better use of land. Around 1,000 new houses will be built for between 4,000 and 5,000 people with priority given to more economically vulnerable people.

[ 166 ] [ 167 ] United States North Carolina National Guard assisting with high-water rescues in Fayetteville, North Carolina In Georgia, the Governor retracted previous evacuations later, emphasizing that their lives could not be endangered for those who chose not to leave. 1,000 members of the National Guard were deployed for help later.
