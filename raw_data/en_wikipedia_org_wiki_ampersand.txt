The **ampersand**, also known as the **and sign**, is the [logogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram "Logogram")**&**, representing the [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjunction "Grammatical conjunction") "and". It originated as a [ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature "Typographic ligature") of the letters of the word _et_ ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") for "and").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-1)

> _Ampersand_: the sign & the name being a [corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_(linguistics) "Corruption (linguistics)") of 'and _[per se](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per\_se\_(terminology) "Per se (terminology)")_ = and'; i.e. '& by itself = and'. The sign derives from the scribes' [ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(typography) "Ligature (typography)") for the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _et_ in certain italic versions, the letters _e_ and _t_ are clearly distinguishable.

Traditionally in English, when spelling aloud, any letter that could also be used as a word in itself ("A", "I", and "[O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocative_case#English "Vocative case")") was referred to by the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") expression _[per se](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/per\_se "wikt:per se")_ ('by itself'), as in "_per se_ A" or "A _per se_ A".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-aglossary-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-worddetective-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-merriam-webster-5) The character &, when used by itself as opposed to more extended forms such as _&c._, was similarly referred to as "and _per se_ and".[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-7) This last phrase was routinely slurred to "ampersand", and the term had entered common English usage by 1837.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-worddetective-4)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-9)

It has been [falsely claimed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_etymology "False etymology") that [Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Marie_Amp%C3%A8re "Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re") used the symbol in his widely read publications and that people began calling the new shape "Amp√®re's and".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-10)

The ampersand can be traced back to the 1st century AD and the old [Roman cursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_cursive "Roman cursive"), in which the letters E and T occasionally were written together to form a [ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature "Typographic ligature") (Evolution of the ampersand ‚Äì figure 1). In the later and more flowing New Roman Cursive, ligatures of all kinds were extremely common; figures 2 and 3 from the middle of 4th century are examples of how the et-ligature could look in this script. During the later development of the Latin script leading up to [Carolingian minuscule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule "Carolingian minuscule") (9th century) the use of ligatures in general diminished. The et-ligature, however, continued to be used and gradually became more stylized and less revealing of its origin (figures 4‚Äì6).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-Tschichold-11)

The modern [italic type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type "Italic type") ampersand is a kind of "[et](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/et "wikt:et")" ligature that goes back to the cursive scripts developed during the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance"). After the advent of [printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing "Printing") in Europe in 1455, printers made extensive use of both the italic and Roman ampersands. Since the ampersand's roots go back to Roman times, many languages that use a variation of the [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet") make use of it.

The ampersand often appeared as a character at the end of the Latin alphabet, as for example in [Byrhtfer√∞'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrhtferth "Byrhtferth") list of letters from 1011.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-12) Similarly, & was regarded as the 27th letter of the [English alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet "English alphabet"), as taught to children in the US and elsewhere. An example may be seen in M. B. Moore's 1863 book _The Dixie Primer, for the Little Folks_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-13) In her 1859 novel _[Adam Bede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam\_Bede "Adam Bede")_, [George Eliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eliot "George Eliot") refers to this when she makes Jacob Storey say: "He thought it [Z] had only been put to finish off th' alphabet like; though ampusand would ha' done as well, for what he could see."[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-14) The popular nursery rhyme [Apple Pie ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pie_ABC "Apple Pie ABC") finishes with the lines "X, Y, Z, and ampersand, All wished for a piece in hand".

Bilingual Irish street sign, with parallel _agus_ and ampersand.

In [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language "Irish language") and [Scottish Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic "Scottish Gaelic"), the character ‚Åä (U+204A‚Åä[TIRONIAN SIGN ET](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E2%81%8A "wikt:‚Åä")) is used in place of the ampersand. This character is a survival of [Tironian notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tironian_notes "Tironian notes"), a [medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval "Medieval")[shorthand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand "Shorthand") system. This character is known as the Tironian Et in English, the _agus_ in Irish, and the _agusan_ in Scottish Gaelic.

The [logical conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction "Logical conjunction") symbol, ‚àß, is often pronounced "and," but is not related to the ampersand.

Writing the ampersand
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ampersand&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Writing the ampersand")]

In everyday [handwriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting "Handwriting"), the ampersand is sometimes simplified in design as a large lowercase [epsilon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon "Epsilon")∆ê or a reversed numeral 3, superimposed by a vertical line.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-handwriting-15) The ampersand is also sometimes shown as an epsilon with a vertical line above and below it or a dot above and below it.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-handwriting-15)

The [plus sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_sign "Plus sign")+ (itself based on an et-ligature[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-16)) is often informally used in place of an ampersand, sometimes with an added loop and resembling …¨.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Other times it is a single stroke with a diagonal line connecting the bottom to the left side. This was a version of shorthand for ampersand, and the stroke economy of this version provided ease of writing for workers while also assuring the character was distinct from other numeric or alphabetic symbols.

A handwritten [plus sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_sign "Plus sign") used, like the ampersand, to mean "and"

Ampersands are commonly seen in business names formed from a partnership of two or more people, such as _[Johnson & Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson\_%26\_Johnson "Johnson & Johnson")_, _[Dolce & Gabbana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolce\_%26\_Gabbana "Dolce & Gabbana")_, _[Marks & Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marks\_%26\_Spencer "Marks & Spencer")_ and _[Tiffany & Co](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany\_%26\_Co "Tiffany & Co")_, as well as some abbreviations containing the word _and_, such as _[AT&T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T "AT&T")_ (American Telephone and Telegraph), _[A&P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%26P "A&P")_ (supermarkets), _[P&O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%26O "P&O")_ (originally "Peninsular and Oriental", shipping and logistics company), _R&D_ ([research and development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development "Research and development")), _D&B_ ([drum and bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_and_bass "Drum and bass")), _D&D_ ([Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons "Dungeons & Dragons")), _R&B_ ([rhythm and blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues "Rhythm and blues")), _B&B_ ([bed and breakfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_and_breakfast "Bed and breakfast")), and _P&L_ ([profit and loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_and_loss "Profit and loss")).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-18)

In [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film "Film") credits for stories, [screenplays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay "Screenplay"), etc., _&_ indicates a closer collaboration than _and_. The ampersand is used by the [Writers Guild of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America "Writers Guild of America") to denote two writers collaborating on a specific script, rather than one writer rewriting another's work. In screenplays, two authors joined with _&_ collaborated on the script, while two authors joined with _and_ worked on the script at different times and may not have consulted each other at all.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-20) In the latter case, they both contributed enough significant material to the screenplay to receive credit but did not work together. As a result, both & and _and_ may appear in the same credit, as appropriate to how the writing proceeded.

In [APA style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APA_style "APA style"), the ampersand is used when citing sources in text such as (Jones & Jones, 2005). In the list of references, an ampersand precedes the last author's name when there is more than one author.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-21) (This does not apply to [MLA style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_MLA_Style_Manual "The MLA Style Manual"), which calls for the "and" to be spelled.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-22))

The phrase _[et cetera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Et\_cetera "Et cetera")_ ("and the rest"), usually written as _etc._ can be abbreviated _&c._ representing the combination _et_ + _c(etera)_.

The ampersand can be used to indicate that the "and" in a listed item is a part of the item's name and not a separator (e.g. "Rock, pop, rhythm & blues and hip hop").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The ampersand may still be used as an abbreviation for "and" in informal writing regardless of how "and" is used.

### Encoding and display

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ampersand&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Encoding and display")]

The character exists in many computer character sets, usually at 38 (26 hex) from [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII"). [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") provides the following variants:

The last six of these are carryovers from the [Wingdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingdings "Wingdings") fonts, and are meant only for backward compatibility with those fonts.

On the [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY")[keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout "Keyboard layout"), the ampersand is ‚áß Shift+7. It is almost always available on keyboard layouts, sometimes on ‚áß Shift+6 or ‚áß Shift+8. On the [AZERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZERTY "AZERTY") keyboard layout, & is an unmodified keystroke, positioned above A.

### Programming languages

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ampersand&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Programming languages")]

In the 20th century, following the development of [formal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_logic "Formal logic"), the ampersand became a commonly used logical notation for the [binary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operator "Binary operator") or [sentential connective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentential_connective "Sentential connective")_[AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical\_conjunction "Logical conjunction")_. This usage was adopted in computing.

Many languages with syntax derived from [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)"), including [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++"), [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl"),[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-23) and more differentiate between:

*   `&` for [bitwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation "Bitwise operation") AND `(4 & 2)` is zero, `(4 & 5)` is 4.
*   `&&` for [short-circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_evaluation "Minimal evaluation")[logical AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction "Logical conjunction")`(4 && 2)` is true.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-24)

In [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)"), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++"),[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-25) and [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language) "Go (programming language)"),[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-26) a prefix `&` is a unary operator denoting the [address in memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address "Memory address") of the argument, e.g. `&x, &func, &a[3]`.

In [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") and [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP "PHP"), unary prefix `&` before a [formal parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_science) "Parameter (computer science)") of a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(programming) "Function (programming)") denotes [pass-by-reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(C%2B%2B) "Reference (C++)").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-27)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-28)

In [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) "Pascal (programming language)"), the `&` as the first character of an identifier prevents the compiler from treating it as a keyword, thus _[escaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape\_character "Escape character")_ it.

In [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran "Fortran"), the ampersand forces the compiler to treat two lines as one. This is accomplished by placing an ampersand at the end of the first line and at the beginning of the second line.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-29)

In many implementations of [ALGOL 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60 "ALGOL 60") the ampersand denotes the tens exponent of a real number.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp "Common Lisp"), the ampersand is the prefix for [lambda list](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lambda_list&action=edit&redlink=1 "Lambda list (page does not exist)") keywords.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-30)

Ampersand is the [string concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_concatenation "String concatenation") operator in many [BASIC dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_programming_language "BASIC programming language"), [AppleScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript "AppleScript"), [Lingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(programming_language) "Lingo (programming language)"), [HyperTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk "HyperTalk"), and [FileMaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker "FileMaker").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language) "Ada (programming language)") it applies to all one-dimensional arrays, not just strings.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[BASIC-PLUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC-PLUS "BASIC-PLUS") on the [DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation")[PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11 "PDP-11") uses the ampersand as a short form of the verb `PRINT`.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Applesoft BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC "Applesoft BASIC") used the ampersand as an internal command, not intended to be used for general programming, that invoked a [machine language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_language "Machine language") program in the computer's [ROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory "Read-only memory").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In some versions of BASIC, unary suffix & denotes a variable is of type _long_, or 32 [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit "Bit") in length.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The ampersand was occasionally used as a prefix to denote a [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal") number, such as `&FF` for decimal 255, for instance in [BBC BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC "BBC BASIC").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] (The modern convention is to use "x" as a prefix to denote hexadecimal, thus `xFF`.) Some other languages, such as the [Monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code_monitor "Machine code monitor") built into ROM on the [Commodore 128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128 "Commodore 128"), used it to indicate [octal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal "Octal") instead, a convention that spread throughout the Commodore community and is now used in the [VICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VICE "VICE") emulator.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-31)

In [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL "MySQL"), `&` has dual roles. As well as a logical AND, it serves as the bitwise operator of an intersection between elements.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-32)

[Dyalog APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyalog_APL "Dyalog APL") uses ampersand similarly to [Unix shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#Unix_shells), spawning a separate [green thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_thread "Green thread") upon application of a function.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In more recent years, the ampersand has made its way into the [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language) "Haskell (programming language)") standard library, representing flipped [function application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_application "Function application"): `x & f` means the same thing as `f x`.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-33)

[Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl") uses the ampersand as a [sigil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_(computer_programming) "Sigil (computer programming)") to refer to subroutines:

*   In Perl 4 and earlier, it was effectively required to call user-defined subroutines[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-34)
*   In Perl 5, it can still be used to modify the way user-defined subroutines are called[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-35)
*   In [Raku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raku_(programming_language) "Raku (programming language)") (formerly known as Perl 6), the ampersand [sigil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_(computer_programming) "Sigil (computer programming)") is only used when referring to a subroutine as an object, never when calling it[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-36)

In the [Xbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbase "Xbase") family of languages, which includes [dBase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase "DBase") and [FoxPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro "FoxPro"), a singe ampersand signifies macro substitution (where elements of program code are stored in a variable for evaluation at run time). A pair of consecutive ampersands marks the start of an in-line comment.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-37)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-38)

In MASM 80x86 Assembly Language, `&` is the Substitution Operator, which tells the assembler to replace a macro parameter or text macro name with its actual value.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-39)

Ampersand is the name of a reactive programming language, which uses [relation algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_algebra "Relation algebra") to specify [information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system "Information system").[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-40)

In [SGML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML "SGML"), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML"), and [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML"), the ampersand is used to introduce an [SGML entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML_entity "SGML entity"), such as `&nbsp;` (for non-breaking space) or `&alpha;` (for the Greek letter Œ±). The HTML and XML encoding for the ampersand character is the entity `&amp;`.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-41) This can create a problem known as [delimiter collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#Delimiter_collision "Delimiter") when converting text into one of these markup languages. For instance, when putting URLs or other material containing ampersands into XML format files such as [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format) "RSS (file format)") files the & must be replaced with &amp; or they are considered not well formed, and computers will be unable to read the files correctly. SGML derived the use from [IBM Generalized Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Generalized_Markup_Language "IBM Generalized Markup Language"), which was one of many IBM-mainframe languages to use the ampersand to signal a text substitution, eventually going back to [System/360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360 "IBM System/360") macro assembly language.

In the plain [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX "TeX")[markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language "Markup language"), the ampersand is used to mark [tabstops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabstop "Tabstop"). The ampersand itself can be applied in TeX with `\&`. The [Computer Modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern "Computer Modern") fonts replace it with an "E.T." symbol in the cmti _#_ (text italic) fonts, so it can be entered as `{\it\&}` in running text when using the default (Computer Modern) fonts.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-42)

In [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") menus, labels, and other captions, the ampersand is used to denote the next letter as a keyboard shortcut (called an "Access key" by Microsoft).[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-msdn-43) For instance setting a button label to `"&Print"` makes it display as P rint and for [Alt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_key "Alt key")+P to be a shortcut equivalent to pressing that button. A double ampersand is needed in order to display a real ampersand. This convention originated in the first WIN32 api, and is used in [Windows Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms "Windows Forms"),[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-msdn-43) (but not WPF, which uses underscore _ for this purpose) and is also copied into many other toolkits on multiple operating systems. Sometimes this causes problems similar to other programs that fail to sanitize markup from user input, for instance [Navision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navision "Navision") databases have trouble if this character is in either "Text" or "Code" fields.

Some Unix shells use the ampersand as a [metacharacter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacharacter "Metacharacter"):

Some Unix shells, like the [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX "POSIX") standard `sh` shell, use an ampersand to [execute a process in the background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_control_(Unix) "Job control (Unix)") and to duplicate [file descriptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor "File descriptor").

*   In [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) "Bash (Unix shell)"), the ampersand can separate words, control the command history, duplicate file descriptors, perform logical operations, control jobs, and participate in [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression").[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-44)

The generic [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator "Uniform Resource Locator") (Uniform Resource Locator) syntax allows for a [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string "Query string") to be appended to a file name in a web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark "Question mark"), or query mark, ?, is used to indicate the start of a query string.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#cite_note-45) A query string is usually made up of a number of different [name‚Äìvalue pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name%E2%80%93value_pair "Name‚Äìvalue pair"), each separated by the ampersand symbol, &. For example, `http://www.example.org/list.php?order=ascending&year=2025`. A "real" ampersand must be replaced by `%26` to avoid interpretation as this syntax.
