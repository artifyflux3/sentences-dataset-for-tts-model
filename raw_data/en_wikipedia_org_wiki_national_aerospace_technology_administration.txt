It was founded on 1 April 2013.

[ 1 ] Formerly called the National Aerospace Development Administration (NADA), it changed its name in September 2023 following the 9th Session of the 14th Supreme People's Assembly .

[ 2 ] The current basis for the activities of NATA is the Law on Space Development, passed in 2014 during the 7th session of the 12th Supreme People's Assembly . The act sets out the North Korean principles of the development of space capabilities as it relates to the principles of the North Korean Juche ideology and independence, as well as the aim of solving scientific and technological problems of space exploration to improve its economy, science, and technology.

[ citation needed ] The law also regulates the position of NATA and the principles of notification, security, research, and possibly [ clarification needed ] compensation in relation to satellite launches. The law calls for the cooperation with international organizations and other countries, equality and mutual benefit, and respect for international law and international regulations for space. The law also opposes the militarization of space .

[ citation needed ] Korean Committee of Space Technology [ edit ] Further information: Korean Committee of Space Technology Unha-3 Rocket on 8 April 2012 in Sohae In 1980, KCST, the executive space agency of North Korea, began research and development with the aim of producing and placing communications satellites, Earth observation satellites, and weather observation satellites into orbit.

[ 3 ] International legal regime of the North Korea's space activities [ edit ] In 2009, North Korea signed the Outer Space Treaty , and the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space Objects .

[ 4 ] In 2016, North Korea accepted the Rescue Agreement , an international agreement setting forth rights and obligations of states concerning the rescue of persons in space, as well as the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects .

[ 3 ] Logos [ edit ] NATA's previous emblem consisted of a dark blue globe with the word Kukgaujugaebalkuk (National Space Development Administration) in white Korean letters on the bottom, DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) in light blue letters on the top, the Big Dipper , NADA in white letters in the middle, and two bright blue rings symbolizing satellite orbits and the intention of place on all orbits of satellites. The logo was described as representing the agency's "character, mission, position, and development prospect". Ursa Major was intended to symbolize and glorify the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a space power.

[ 1 ] [ 5 ] Western media pointed out that the logo bore a striking resemblance to NASA 's logo — both have blue globes, white lettering, stars, and swooshed rings.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] NATA's new logo includes an additional red stripe, similar to NASA's.
