Thallus of Pellia epiphylla Thallus ( pl.

: thalli ), from Latinized Greek θαλλός ( thallos ), meaning "a green shoot " or " twig ", is the vegetative tissue of some organisms in diverse groups such as algae , fungi , some liverworts , lichens , and the Myxogastria . A thallus usually names the entire body of a multicellular non-moving organism in which there is no organization of the tissues into organs .

[ 1 ] Many of these organisms were previously known as the thallophytes , a polyphyletic group of distantly related organisms. An organism or structure resembling a thallus is called thalloid , thalloidal , thalliform , thalline , or thallose .

Even though thalli do not have organized and distinct parts ( leaves , roots , and stems ) as do the vascular plants , they may have analogous structures that resemble their vascular "equivalents". The analogous structures have similar function or macroscopic structure, but different microscopic structure; for example, no thallus has vascular tissue . In exceptional cases such as the Lemnoideae , where the structure of a vascular plant is in fact thallus-like, it is referred to as having a thalloid structure, or sometimes as a thalloid.

Although a thallus is largely undifferentiated in terms of its anatomy, there can be visible differences and functional differences. A kelp , for example, may have its thallus divided into three regions. The parts of a kelp thallus include the holdfast (anchor), stipe (supports the blades) and the blades (for photosynthesis).

[ 2 ] The thallus of a fungus is usually called a mycelium . The term thallus is also commonly used to refer to the vegetative body of a lichen. In seaweed , thallus is sometimes also called ' frond '.

The gametophyte of some non-thallophyte plants – clubmosses , horsetails , and ferns is termed " prothallus ".
