( August 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In population genetics , Ewens's sampling formula describes the probabilities associated with counts of how many different alleles are observed a given number of times in the sample .

Definition [ edit ] Ewens's sampling formula, introduced by Warren Ewens , states that under certain conditions (specified below), if a random sample of n gametes is taken from a population and classified according to the gene at a particular locus then the probability that there are a 1 alleles represented once in the sample, and a 2 alleles represented twice, and so on, is Pr ⁡ ⁡ ( a 1 , … … , a n ; θ θ ) = n !

θ θ ( θ θ + 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( θ θ + n − − 1 ) ∏ ∏ j = 1 n θ θ a j j a j a j !

, {\displaystyle \operatorname {Pr} (a_{1},\dots ,a_{n};\theta )={n! \over \theta (\theta +1)\cdots (\theta +n-1)}\prod _{j=1}^{n}{\theta ^{a_{j}} \over j^{a_{j}}a_{j}!},} for some positive number θ representing the population mutation rate , whenever a 1 , … … , a n {\displaystyle a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}} is a sequence of nonnegative integers such that a 1 + 2 a 2 + 3 a 3 + ⋯ ⋯ + n a n = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n i a i = n .

{\displaystyle a_{1}+2a_{2}+3a_{3}+\cdots +na_{n}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}ia_{i}=n.\,} The phrase "under certain conditions" used above is made precise by the following assumptions: The sample size n is small by comparison to the size of the whole population; and The population is in statistical equilibrium under mutation and genetic drift and the role of selection at the locus in question is negligible; and Every mutant allele is novel.

See also: Infinite-alleles model This is a probability distribution on the set of all partitions of the integer n . Among probabilists and statisticians it is often called the multivariate Ewens distribution .

Mathematical properties [ edit ] When θ = 0, the probability is 1 that all n genes are the same. When θ = 1, then the distribution is precisely that of the integer partition induced by a uniformly distributed random permutation . As θ → ∞, the probability that no two of the n genes are the same approaches 1.

This family of probability distributions enjoys the property that if after the sample of n is taken, m of the n gametes are chosen without replacement, then the resulting probability distribution on the set of all partitions of the smaller integer m is just what the formula above would give if m were put in place of n .

The Ewens distribution arises naturally from the Chinese restaurant process .
