Established in 1926 by Edward Kennard Rand , it is widely regarded as the most prestigious journal in medieval studies.

[ 1 ] The journal's primary focus is on the time period from 500 to 1500 in Western Europe , but also on related subjects such as Byzantine , Hebrew , Arabic , Armenian and Slavic studies. As of 2019 [update] , the editor is Katherine L. Jansen .

The organization and its journal were first proposed in 1921 at a meeting of the Modern Language Association , and the journal's focus was interdisciplinary from its beginning, [ 2 ] with one reviewer noting a specific interest in Medieval Latin .
