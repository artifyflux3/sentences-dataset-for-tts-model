Judge Judges at the International Court of Justice Occupation Names Judge, justice , magistrate Occupation type Profession Activity sectors Law , Justice Description Education required University degree in law and experience as a lawyer Fields of employment Courts Related jobs Barrister , prosecutor A judge is a person who presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a judicial panel . In an adversarial system , the judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers or solicitors of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling in the case based on their interpretation of the law and their own personal judgment. A judge is expected to conduct the trial impartially and, typically, in an open court .

The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions . In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury . In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation , a judge might also be an examining magistrate . The presiding judge ensures that all court proceedings are lawful and orderly.

Powers and functions [ edit ] The ultimate task of a judge is to settle a legal dispute in a final and publicly lawful manner in agreement with substantial partialities. Judges exercise significant governmental power. They can order police, military, or judicial officials to carry out searches, arrests, imprisonments, garnishments, detentions, seizures, deportations, and similar actions. However, judges also supervise trial procedures to ensure consistency and impartiality and to prevent arbitrariness. A judge’s powers are checked by higher courts, such as courts of appeal and supreme courts.

The court usually has three main legally trained court officials: the judge, the prosecutor and the defence attorney. The role of a judge can vary between legal systems. In an adversarial system (common law), as in effect in the U.S. and England, the judge functions as an impartial referee, mainly ensuring correct procedure, while the prosecution and the defense present their case to a jury , often selected from common citizens. The main factfinder is the jury, and the judge will then finalize sentencing. Nevertheless, in smaller cases judges can issue summary judgments without proceeding to a jury trial. In an inquisitorial system (civil law), as in effect in continental Europe, there is no jury and the main factfinder is the judge, who will do the presiding, judging and sentencing on their own. As such, the judge is expected to apply the law directly, as in the French expression Le juge est la bouche de la loi ("The judge is the mouth of the law"). Furthermore, in some systems even investigations may be conducted by the judge, functioning as an examining magistrate.

Judges may work alone in smaller cases, but in criminal, family and other significant cases, they work in a panel. In some civil law systems, this panel may include lay judges . Unlike professional judges, lay judges are not legally trained, but unlike jurors, lay judges are usually volunteers and may be politically appointed. Judges are often assisted by law clerks , referendaries and notaries in legal cases and by bailiffs or similar with security.

Requirements and appointment [ edit ] There are both volunteer and professional judges. A volunteer judge, such as an English magistrate , is not required to have legal training and is unpaid. Whereas, a professional judge is required to be legally educated ; in the U.S., this generally requires a degree of Juris Doctor . Furthermore, significant professional experience is often required; for example, in the U.S., judges are often appointed from experienced attorneys . Judges are often appointed by the head of state . However in some jurisdictions, judges are elected in a political election.

[ 1 ] Impartiality is often considered important for rule of law . Thus, in many jurisdictions judges may be appointed for life, so that they cannot be removed by the executive. However, in non-democratic systems, the appointment of judges may be highly politicized and they often receive instructions on how to judge, and may be removed if their conduct does not please the political leadership.

Judge as an occupation [ edit ] Judges must be able to research and process extensive lengths of documents, witness testimonies, and other case material, understand complex cases and possess a thorough understanding of the law and legal procedure, which requires excellent skills in logical reasoning, analysis and decision-making. Excellent writing skills are also a necessity, given the finality and authority of the documents written. Judges work with people all the time; by the nature of the job, good dispute resolution and interpersonal skills are a necessity.

[ 2 ] Judges are required to have good moral character , i.e. there must be no history of crime. Professional judges often enjoy a high salary, in the U.S. the median salary of judges is $101,690 per annum, [ 2 ] and federal judges earn $208,000–$267,000 per annum.

[ 3 ] Gender effects [ edit ] In many civil law countries in Europe the majority of judges are women: in 6 countries ( Slovenia , Serbia , Latvia , Luxembourg , Greece and Hungary ) women make more that 70% of judges of the first instance. In contrast, in common law countries ( UK , Ireland , Malta and the United States) the situation is reverse: over 70% of judges of the first instance are men.

[ 4 ] On the other hand, women are underrepresented in the supreme courts of the United States and European Union member-states, except for in Romania, where over 80% of the judges of the High Court of Cassation and Justice are women.

[ 4 ] Age and retirement [ edit ] In the United States, federal judges are appointed "for good behavior", which means in practice, that federal judges work until they die, voluntarily retire or are impeached.

[ 5 ] The death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the office in 2020 and suspension of Pauline Newman in 2023 reinvigorated the discussion about mandatory retirement age for federal judges, but such change would require a constitutional amendment and is unlikely to be implemented soon.

[ 6 ] States have more flexibility in establishing a mandatory retirement age for judges, as was confirmed by the SCOTUS in its 1991 decision Gregory v. Ashcroft . As of 2015, 33 States and the District of Columbia had mandatory retirement ages for State court judges, which ranged from 70 to 75 for most (but is as high as 90 in Vermont ).

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] A 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found significant positive effects on the performance of state Supreme Courts with mandatory retirement age for judges. The authors advocated the adoption of mandatory retirement ages for all federal and state judges, although they felt, that the individual authorities should decide on the specific age for themselves.

[ 9 ] Symbols of office [ edit ] 17th century Spanish judge in full gowns, by Velázquez Main article: Court dress A variety of traditions have become associated with the rank or occupation.

Gavels (a ceremonial hammer) are used by judges in many countries, to the point that the gavel has become a symbol of a judge. In many parts of the world, judges wear long robes (often in black or red) and sit on an elevated platform during trials (known as the bench).

American judges frequently wear black robes. American judges have ceremonial gavels , although American judges have court deputies or bailiffs and contempt of court power as their main devices to maintain decorum in the courtroom. However, in some of the Western United States , like California, judges did not always wear robes and instead wore everyday clothing. Today, some members of state supreme courts , such as the Maryland Supreme Court wear distinct dress. In Italy and Portugal , both judges and lawyers wear particular black robes.

In some countries, especially in the Commonwealth of Nations , judges wear wigs . The long wig often associated with judges is now reserved for ceremonial occasions, although it was part of the standard attire in previous centuries.  A short wig resembling but not identical to a barrister 's wig (a Bench Wig) would be worn in court.  This tradition, however, is being phased out in Britain in non-criminal courts.

[ 10 ] In Oman , the judge wears a long stripe (red, green white), while the attorneys wear the black gown.

In Portugal and in the former Portuguese Empire , the judges used to carry a staff that was red for ordinary judges and white for the judges from the outside .

( September 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Asia [ edit ] Hong Kong [ edit ] In Hong Kong , court proceedings are conducted in either English or Hong Kong Cantonese (a dialect of Yue Chinese ). Judges of Hong Kong retain many of the English traditions such as wearing wigs and robes in trials.

In India, judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts were addressed as Your Lordship or My Lord and Your Ladyship or My Lady , a tradition directly attributable to England. The Bar Council of India had adopted a resolution in April 2006 and added a new Rule 49(1)(j) in the Advocates Act . As per the rule, lawyers can address the court as Your Honour and refer to it as Honourable Court . If it is a subordinate court, lawyers can use terms such as sir or any equivalent phrase in the regional language concerned. Explaining the rationale behind the move, the Bar Council had held that the words such as My Lord and Your Lordship were "relics of the colonial past". The resolution has since been circulated to all state councils and the Supreme Court for adoption but over five years now, the resolution largely remained on paper.

However, in an unprecedented move in October 2009, one of the judges of Madras HC , Justice K Chandru had banned lawyers from addressing his court as My Lord and Your Lordship .

[ 12 ] In a district court ( käräjäoikeus ), ordinary judges work with the title käräjätuomari and the chairman is laamanni ( lawspeaker ). They are assisted by notaries ( notaari ), assessors ( asessori ) and referendaries ( viskaali ) who may sometimes even chair sessions. In appeals courts ( hovioikeus ) an ordinary judge has the title hovioikeudenneuvos , the chairman of a section is hovioikeudenlaamanni and the court is led by a presidentti . In the Supreme Court, judges are titled oikeusneuvos and the court is led by a presidentti .

United Kingdom [ edit ] See also: Forms of address in the United Kingdom § Judiciary England and Wales [ edit ] In the Courts of England and Wales , Supreme Court judges are called Justices of the Supreme Court.  Justices of the Supreme Court who do not hold life peerages are now given the courtesy style "Lord" or "Lady".

[ 18 ] Justices of the Supreme Court are addressed as "My Lord/Lady" in court.  In the law reports, the Justices of the Supreme Court are usually referred to as "Lord/Lady N", although the Weekly Law Reports appends the post-nominal letters "JSC" (e.g. "Lady Smith JSC"). The President and Deputy President of the Court are afforded the post-nominal letters PSC and DPSC respectively. Only experienced barristers or solicitors are usually appointed as judges.

Judges of the High Court and Court of Appeal are addressed (when sitting in those courts) as "My Lord" or "My Lady" and referred to as "Your Lordship" or "Your Ladyship".

Judges of the Court of Appeal, also called Lords Justice of Appeal , are referred to as "Lord Justice N" or "Lady Justice N".  In legal writing, Lords Justices of Appeal are afforded the post nominal letters "LJ": for example, Smith LJ.

When a Justice of the High Court who is not present is being referred to they are described as "Mr./Mrs./Ms. Justice N.

"  In legal writing, the post-nominal letter "J" is used to denote a Justice (male or female) of the High Court; for example, a Justice Smith is referred to as Smith J.

[ 19 ] Unlike American English, no comma is used to offset the letter J from the Justice's name.

[ 19 ] The full stop after the preceding examples terminates the sentence, not the abbreviation, and the abbreviation can be used mid-sentence in prose in formal legal writing.

[ 19 ] Masters of the High Court are addressed as "Master".

Insolvency and Companies Court judges in the High Court are addressed as "Judge".

Northern Ireland [ edit ] The judicial system of Northern Ireland is very similar to that of England and Wales, and superior court judges are addressed the same way as those in England and Wales. However, there are a few differences at the lower levels.

In Northern Ireland, the equivalent to a circuit judge is a county court judge, and they are addressed and titled the same way as a circuit judge is in England and Wales. The senior county court judges assigned to the county court divisions of Belfast and Derry have the titles of Recorder of Belfast and Recorder of Londonderry (or Derry) respectively, but are addressed the same as other county court judges. A district judge sitting in the County Court is addressed as "Your Honour".

A district judge (magistrates' court) is addressed as "Your Worship". A lay magistrate, in cases where they are present, is also addressed as "Your Worship", and may use the post-nominals "LM", e.g. "John Smith LM".

[ 20 ] North America [ edit ] Canada [ edit ] In general, Canadian judges may be addressed directly, depending on the province, as "My Lord", "My Lady", "Your Honour" or "Justice" and are formally referred to in the third person as "The Honourable Mr. (or Madam) Justice 'Forename Surname ' ".  Less formally, judges of a Superior Court are referred to as "Justice 'Surname ' ", not as "Judge 'Surname.

' "  When referred to in a decision of a court, judges' titles are often abbreviated to the suffix "J.", so that Justice Smith will be referred to as Smith J.  Judges in some superior courts are addressed as "My Lord" or "My Lady".

[ 21 ] In Ontario , judges are rarely referred to as "My Lord" or "My Lady", but only as "Your Honour" at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice .

[ 22 ] Formerly, translations of these titles such as Votre Honneur ("your honour") or Votre Seigneurie ("your lordship") were used in French; today, only Monsieur le juge and Madame la juge are officially used. Both the titles "judge" and "justice" are translated juge .

Generally, it is only appropriate to use the term "judge" when speaking of an anonymous or general position, such as "the trial judge", or when referring to a member of an inferior or provincial court such as the Ontario Court of Justice. The exception is Citizenship Judges who are referred to only as "Judge 'Surname ' " in accordance with their appointment as independent decision makers of the Citizenship Commission .

Like other members of the Commonwealth, a justice of the peace is addressed as "Your Worship", and a Master of a Superior Court is referred to as "Master". As of December 7, 2018, Ontario Court Masters are addressed in English as "Your Honour" and in French as "Votre Honneur" and no longer as "Master".

United States [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification .

( March 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The United States Supreme Court in 2010 In many states throughout the United States, a judge is addressed as "Your Honor" or "Judge" when presiding over the court. "Judge" may be more commonly used by attorneys and staff, while either may be commonly used by the plaintiff or defendant. Notably, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County , the largest unified trial court in the United States, has a rule that the judge shall be addressed only as "Your Honor" while in court, and never as "Judge", "Judge (name)", "ma'am", or "sir".

[ 23 ] This is somewhat unusual as "Judge" and "Judge (name)" or similar forms of address are considered appropriate and respectful in many other courts.

The judges of the Supreme Court of the United States , and the judges of the supreme courts of several U.S. states and other countries are called "justices".  Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States and Justices of other courts are addressed as "Justice (name)". The Chief Justice of the United States is formally addressed as "Mr. or Madam Chief Justice" but also may be identified and addressed as "Chief Justice (name)".

Regardless of the specific term employed (judge or justice), the formal title is reduced to the postnominal abbreviation "J." in case citations and certain case law reporters when it is necessary to identify the author of a cited opinion.

[ 19 ] In American English , the postnominal "J." is always divided from the judge's name by a comma and a space, so that a citation to a dissenting opinion by Associate Justice Antonin Scalia would warn that the cited opinion is not the majority opinion with the parenthetical notation "Scalia, J., dissenting".

[ 19 ] The plural form is JJ.

[ 19 ] Unlike British English, this abbreviation style is used only in case citations, and is not used mid-sentence in regular prose (as distinguished from case citations dropped into sentences as parentheticals).

[ 19 ] Thus, a prose sentence discussing the actual contents of a dissenting opinion right before a case citation to that opinion would refer to the reasoning of "Justice Scalia", not "Scalia, J." [ 19 ] The justices of the supreme courts usually hold higher offices than any other judges in a jurisdiction, including a justice of the peace , a judge who holds police court in some jurisdictions and who may also try small claims and misdemeanors . However, the State of New York inverts this usual order. The initial trial court in this state is called the Supreme Court of New York, and its judges are called "justices".  The next highest appellate court is the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, whose judges are also called "justices".  However, the highest court in New York is called the New York Court of Appeals, whose members are called "judges".

Judges in certain jurisdictions, such as New York and New Jersey, who deal with guardianships, trusts and estates are known as " surrogates ".

A senior judge , in American practice, is a retired judge who handles selected cases for a governmental entity while in retirement, on a part-time basis.

Subordinate or inferior jurisdiction judges in American legal practice are sometimes called magistrates , although in the federal judiciary of the United States, they are called magistrate judges . Subordinate judges in American legal practice who are appointed on an ad hoc case-by-case basis, particularly in cases where a great deal of detailed and tedious evidence must be reviewed, are often called "masters" or "special masters".

Judges of courts of specialized jurisdiction (such as bankruptcy courts or juvenile courts ) were sometimes known officially as " referees ", but the use of this title is in decline. Judges sitting in courts of equity in common law systems (such as judges in the equity courts of Delaware ) are called " chancellors ".

Individuals with judicial responsibilities who report to an executive branch official, rather than being a part of the judiciary, are often called " administrative law judges " (ALJs) in American practice. Historically, such officials were previously known as hearing examiners or referees before American English settled on the ALJ title. They commonly make initial determinations regarding matters such as workers' compensation , eligibility for government benefits, regulatory matters, and immigration determinations.

Judges who derive their authority from a contractual agreement of the parties to a dispute, rather than a governmental body, are called arbitrators . They typically do not receive the honorific forms of address nor do they bear the symbolic trappings of a publicly appointed judge. However, it is now common for many retired judges to serve as arbitrators, and they will often write their names as if they were still judges, with the parenthetical "(Ret.)" for "Retired".

Unlike many civil law countries which have some courts on which panels of judges with nearly equal status composed of both legally trained professional judges and lay judges who lack legal training and are not career judges, the United States legal system (like most Anglo-American legal systems) makes a clear distinction between professional judges and laypeople involved in deciding a case who are jurors who are part of a jury . Most but not all American judges have professional credentials as lawyers. Non-lawyer judges in the United States are often elected and are typically either justices of the peace or part-time judges in rural limited jurisdiction courts . A non-lawyer judge typically has the same rights and responsibilities as a lawyer who is a judge holding the same office and is addressed in the same manner.

Oceania [ edit ] Australia [ edit ] Susan Kiefel , former Chief Justice of Australia In Australia judges and, since 2007, magistrates, of all jurisdictions including the High Court of Australia are now addressed as "Your Honour". In legal contexts, they are referred to as "His/Her Honour" and "the Honourable Justice Surname" (for judges of superior courts) or "his/her Honour Judge Surname" (for inferior courts). Outside legal contexts, the formal terms of address are "Judge" (for puisne justices) or "Chief Justice" (for chief justices).

The title for most puisne judges is "Justice", which is abbreviated in law reports to a postnominal "J", in the form "Surname J". Chief Justices of the High Court and of state Supreme Courts are titled "Chief Justice", which is abbreviated in law reports to a postnomial "CJ". Judges in State Supreme Courts with a separate Court of Appeal division (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia) are referred to as Justices/Judges of the Appeal (abbreviated "Surname JA"), while the President of the Court of Appeal is referred to as "President" (abbreviated "Surname P").

[ 24 ] New Zealand [ edit ] In New Zealand , judges of the District Court of New Zealand generally referred to as "His/Her Honour" or "Sir/Madame".  Judges from the High Court , Appeals Court , and Supreme Court are referred to as "Justice [Surname]".  In social settings, it is appropriate to use "Judge" in all cases.

[ 25 ] South America [ edit ] Brazil [ edit ] Judges of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil In Brazil , judges are simply called "Juiz" or "Juíza" (male and female forms of "judge") and traditionally addressed to as "Vossa Excelência" ( lit.
