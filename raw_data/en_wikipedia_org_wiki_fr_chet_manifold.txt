More precisely, a Fréchet manifold consists of a Hausdorff space X {\displaystyle X} with an atlas of coordinate charts over Fréchet spaces whose transitions are smooth mappings .  Thus X {\displaystyle X} has an open cover { U α α } α α ∈ ∈ I , {\displaystyle \left\{U_{\alpha }\right\}_{\alpha \in I},} and a collection of homeomorphisms ϕ ϕ α α : U α α → → F α α {\displaystyle \phi _{\alpha }:U_{\alpha }\to F_{\alpha }} onto their images, where F α α {\displaystyle F_{\alpha }} are Fréchet spaces , such that ϕ ϕ α α β β := ϕ ϕ α α ∘ ∘ ϕ ϕ β β − − 1 | ϕ ϕ β β ( U β β ∩ ∩ U α α ) {\displaystyle \phi _{\alpha \beta }:=\phi _{\alpha }\circ \phi _{\beta }^{-1}|_{\phi _{\beta }\left(U_{\beta }\cap U_{\alpha }\right)}} is smooth for all pairs of indices α α , β β .

{\displaystyle \alpha ,\beta .} Classification up to homeomorphism [ edit ] It is by no means true that a finite-dimensional manifold of dimension n {\displaystyle n} is globally homeomorphic to R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} or even an open subset of R n .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.} However, in an infinite-dimensional setting, it is possible to classify " well-behaved " Fréchet manifolds up to homeomorphism quite nicely.  A 1969 theorem of David Henderson states that every infinite-dimensional, separable , metric Fréchet manifold X {\displaystyle X} can be embedded as an open subset of the infinite-dimensional, separable Hilbert space , H {\displaystyle H} (up to linear isomorphism, there is only one such space).

The embedding homeomorphism can be used as a global chart for X .

{\displaystyle X.} Thus, in the infinite-dimensional, separable, metric case, up to homeomorphism, the "only" topological Fréchet manifolds are the open subsets of the separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. But in the case of differentiable or smooth Fréchet manifolds (up to the appropriate notion of diffeomorphism) this fails [ citation needed ] .
