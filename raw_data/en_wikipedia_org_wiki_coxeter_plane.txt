In mathematics , a Coxeter element is an element of an irreducible Coxeter group which is a product of all simple reflections. The product depends on the order in which they are taken, but different orderings produce conjugate elements, which have the same order . This order is known as the Coxeter number . They are named after British-Canadian geometer H.S.M. Coxeter , who introduced the groups in 1934 as abstractions of reflection groups .

[ 1 ] Definitions [ edit ] Note that this article assumes a finite Coxeter group . For infinite Coxeter groups, there are multiple conjugacy classes of Coxeter elements, and they have infinite order.

There are many different ways to define the Coxeter number h of an irreducible root system.

The Coxeter number is the order of any Coxeter element; .

The Coxeter number is ⁠ 2 m n , {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2m}{n}},} ⁠ where n is the rank, and m is the number of reflections. In the crystallographic case, m is half the number of roots ; and 2 m + n is the dimension of the  corresponding semisimple Lie algebra .

If the highest root is ∑ ∑ m i α α i {\displaystyle \sum m_{i}\alpha _{i}} for simple roots α i , then the Coxeter number is 1 + ∑ ∑ m i .

{\displaystyle 1+\sum m_{i}.} The Coxeter number is the highest degree of a fundamental invariant of the Coxeter group acting on polynomials.

The Coxeter number for each Dynkin type is given in the following table: Coxeter group Coxeter diagram Dynkin diagram Reflections m = n h 2 {\displaystyle m={\tfrac {nh}{2}}} [ 2 ] Coxeter number h Dual Coxeter number Degrees of fundamental invariants A n [3,3...,3] ...

whose generators are the fundamental invariants; their degrees are given in the table above. 
Notice that if m is a degree of a fundamental invariant then so is h + 2 − m .

The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element are the numbers e 2 π π i m − − 1 h {\displaystyle e^{2\pi i{\frac {m-1}{h}}}} as m runs through the degrees of the fundamental invariants. Since this starts with m = 2 , these include the primitive h th root of unity , ζ ζ h = e 2 π π i 1 h , {\displaystyle \zeta _{h}=e^{2\pi i{\frac {1}{h}}},} which is important in the Coxeter plane , below.

The dual Coxeter number is 1 plus the sum of the coefficients of simple roots in the highest short root of the dual root system .

Group order [ edit ] There are relations between the order g of the Coxeter group and the Coxeter number h : [ 3 ] [ p ] : 2 h g p = 1 [ p , q ] : 8 g p , q = 2 p + 2 q − − 1 [ p , q , r ] : 64 h g p , q , r = 12 − − p − − 2 q − − r + 4 p + 4 r [ p , q , r , s ] : 16 g p , q , r , s = 8 g p , q , r + 8 g q , r , s + 2 p s − − 1 p − − 1 q − − 1 r − − 1 s + 1 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{}[p]:&\quad {\frac {2h}{g_{p}}}=1\\[4pt][p,q]:&\quad {\frac {8}{g_{p,q}}}={\frac {2}{p}}+{\frac {2}{q}}-1\\[4pt][p,q,r]:&\quad {\frac {64h}{g_{p,q,r}}}=12-p-2q-r+{\frac {4}{p}}+{\frac {4}{r}}\\[4pt][p,q,r,s]:&\quad {\frac {16}{g_{p,q,r,s}}}={\frac {8}{g_{p,q,r}}}+{\frac {8}{g_{q,r,s}}}+{\frac {2}{ps}}-{\frac {1}{p}}-{\frac {1}{q}}-{\frac {1}{r}}-{\frac {1}{s}}+1\\[4pt]\vdots \qquad &\qquad \vdots \end{aligned}}} For example, [3,3,5] has h = 30 : 64 × × 30 g 3 , 3 , 5 = 12 − − 3 − − 6 − − 5 + 4 3 + 4 5 = 2 15 , ∴ ∴ g 3 , 3 , 5 = 1920 × × 15 2 = 960 × × 15 = 14400.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&{\frac {64\times 30}{g_{3,3,5}}}=12-3-6-5+{\frac {4}{3}}+{\frac {4}{5}}={\frac {2}{15}},\\[4pt]&\therefore g_{3,3,5}={\frac {1920\times 15}{2}}=960\times 15=14400.\end{aligned}}} Coxeter elements [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( December 2008 ) Distinct Coxeter elements correspond to orientations of the Coxeter diagram (i.e. to Dynkin quivers ): the simple reflections corresponding to source vertices are written first, downstream vertices later, and sinks last. (The choice of order among non-adjacent vertices is irrelevant, since they correspond to commuting reflections.)  A special choice is the alternating orientation, in which the simple reflections are partitioned into two sets of non-adjacent vertices, and all edges are oriented from the first to the second set.

[ 4 ] The alternating orientation produces a special Coxeter element w satisfying w h / 2 = w 0 , {\displaystyle w^{h/2}=w_{0},} where w 0 is the longest element , provided the Coxeter number h is even.

For A n − − 1 ≅ ≅ S n , {\displaystyle A_{n-1}\cong S_{n},} the symmetric group on n elements, Coxeter elements are certain n -cycles: 
the product of simple reflections ( 1 , 2 ) ( 2 , 3 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( n − − 1 , n ) {\displaystyle (1,2)(2,3)\cdots (n-1,n)} is the Coxeter element ( 1 , 2 , 3 , … … , n ) {\displaystyle (1,2,3,\dots ,n)} .

[ 5 ] For n even, the alternating orientation Coxeter element is: ( 1 , 2 ) ( 3 , 4 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( 2 , 3 ) ( 4 , 5 ) ⋯ ⋯ = ( 2 , 4 , 6 , … … , n − − 2 , n , n − − 1 , n − − 3 , … … , 5 , 3 , 1 ) .

{\displaystyle (1,2)(3,4)\cdots (2,3)(4,5)\cdots =(2,4,6,\ldots ,n{-}2,n,n{-}1,n{-}3,\ldots ,5,3,1).} There are 2 n − − 2 {\displaystyle 2^{n-2}} distinct Coxeter elements among the ( n − − 1 ) !

{\displaystyle (n{-}1)!} n -cycles.

The dihedral group Dih p is generated by two reflections that form an angle of 2 π π 2 p , {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2\pi }{2p}},} and thus the two Coxeter elements are their product in either order, which is a rotation by ± ± 2 π π p .

{\displaystyle \pm {\tfrac {2\pi }{p}}.} Coxeter plane [ edit ] Projection of E 8 root system onto Coxeter plane, showing 30-fold symmetry.

For a given Coxeter element w , there is a unique plane P on which w acts by rotation by ⁠ 2 π π h .

{\displaystyle {\tfrac {2\pi }{h}}.} ⁠ This is called the Coxeter plane [ 6 ] and is the plane on which P has eigenvalues e 2 π π i 1 h {\displaystyle e^{2\pi i{\frac {1}{h}}}} and e − − 2 π π i 1 h = e 2 π π i h − − 1 h .

{\displaystyle e^{-2\pi i{\frac {1}{h}}}=e^{2\pi i{\frac {h-1}{h}}}.} [ 7 ] This plane was first systematically studied in ( Coxeter 1948 ), [ 8 ] and subsequently used in ( Steinberg 1959 ) to provide uniform proofs about properties of Coxeter elements.

[ 8 ] The Coxeter plane is often used to draw diagrams of higher-dimensional polytopes and root systems – the vertices and edges of the polytope, or roots (and some edges connecting these) are orthogonally projected onto the Coxeter plane, yielding a Petrie polygon with h -fold rotational symmetry.

[ 9 ] For root systems, no root maps to zero, corresponding to the Coxeter element not fixing any root or rather axis (not having eigenvalue 1 or −1), so the projections of orbits under w form h -fold circular arrangements [ 9 ] and there is an empty center, as in the E 8 diagram at above right. For polytopes, a vertex may map to zero, as depicted below. Projections onto the Coxeter plane are depicted below for the Platonic solids .

In three dimensions, the symmetry of a regular polyhedron , { p , q }, with one directed Petrie polygon marked, defined as a composite of 3 reflections, has rotoinversion symmetry S h , [2 + , h + ] , order h . Adding a mirror, the symmetry can be doubled to antiprismatic symmetry, D h d , [2 + , h ] , order 2 h . In orthogonal 2D projection, this becomes dihedral symmetry , Dih h , [ h ] , order 2 h .

In four dimensions, the symmetry of a regular polychoron , { p , q , r }, with one directed Petrie polygon marked is a double rotation , defined as a composite of 4 reflections, with symmetry + 1 / h [C h ×C h ] [ 10 ] ( John H. Conway ), (C 2h /C 1 ;C 2h /C 1 ) (#1', Patrick du Val (1964) [ 11 ] ), order h .
