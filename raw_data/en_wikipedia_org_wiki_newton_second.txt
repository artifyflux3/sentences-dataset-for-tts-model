General information Unit system SI Unit of impulse and momentum Symbol N⋅s Named after Isaac Newton In SI base units : kg ⋅ m / s The newton-second (also newton second ; symbol: N⋅s or N s ) [ 1 ] is the unit of impulse in the International System of Units (SI). It is dimensionally equivalent to the momentum unit kilogram-metre per second ( kg⋅m/s ).  One newton-second corresponds to a one- newton force applied for one second .

F → → ⋅ ⋅ t = Δ Δ m v → → {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}\cdot t=\Delta m{\vec {v}}} It can be used to identify the resultant velocity of a mass if a force accelerates the mass for a specific time interval.

Definition [ edit ] Momentum is given by the formula: p = m v , {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} ,} p {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} } is the momentum in newton-seconds (N⋅s) or "kilogram-metres per second" (kg⋅m/s) m {\displaystyle m} is the mass in kilograms (kg) v {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} } is the velocity in metres per second (m/s) Examples [ edit ] This table gives the magnitudes of some momenta for various masses and speeds .

0.42 38 16 The momentum of the famous football kick of the Brazilian player Roberto Carlos in the match against France in 1997. The football had a speed of 137 km/h (85 mph), making it one of the hardest kicks measured.

^ Space Shuttle weight here includes the heaviest possible payload (27500 kg), empty external tank (30000 kg), and the shuttle itself (75000 kg) all in a low Earth orbit (8.05 km/s). As the Space Shuttle uses staging , not all launched components reach all the way to orbit (e.g. the boosters ). The total impulse gained by all stages together during the launch is 5.7 × 10 9 Ns.
