Discovery Discovered¬†by Hubble Space Telescope Discovery¬†date 22 September 2016 Detection method Gravitational microlensing Orbital characteristics Star OGLE-2007-BLG-349 Physical characteristics Mass 80 (¬± 13) [ 1 ] M üú® OGLE-2007-BLG-349Lb [ note 1 ] [ 2 ] is a circumbinary extrasolar planet about 8,000 light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius .

[ 3 ] It is the first circumbinary exoplanet to be discovered using the microlensing method of detecting exoplanets.

[ 1 ] Characteristics [ edit ] Mass and orbit [ edit ] OGLE-2007-BLG-349Lb is a super-Neptune , an exoplanet that has a mass and radius larger than that of Neptune . It has a mass of around 80 M üú® .

[ 1 ] This is somewhat close to the mass of Saturn , 95 M üú® , so OGLE-2007-BLG-349Lb can also be considered a gas giant . It orbits at a distance of around 2.9 AU in a circumbinary orbit, meaning it orbits around two stars.

Host star [ edit ] The planet orbits in a circumbinary ( M-type ) binary star system named OGLE-2007-BLG-349L . They orbit around each other roughly every 9 days.

[ 1 ] The stars have masses of 0.41 and 0.30 M ‚òâ , respectively. The age of the system, radii and temperatures of the stars are not known. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old [ 4 ] [ 5 ] and has a surface temperature of 5778 K.

[ 6 ] The star's apparent magnitude , or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 14.3. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye.

See also [ edit ] Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) 47 Ursae Majoris b OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb OGLE-2006-BLG-109Lb Notes [ edit ] ^ The initial paper intentionally refers to the planet as planet "c", as their solution to "an apparent inconsistency" in exoplanet naming convention . Other sources, such as the SIMBAD Astronomical Database and Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia , refer to it as planet "b", however NASA Exoplanet Archive does not.
