In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), an **operator** is generally a [mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics) "Map (mathematics)") or [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") that acts on elements of a [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)") to produce elements of another space (possibly and sometimes required to be the same space). There is no general definition of an _operator_, but the term is often used in place of _function_ when the [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function "Domain of a function") is a set of functions or other structured objects. Also, the domain of an operator is often difficult to characterize explicitly (for example in the case of an [integral operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_operator "Integral operator")), and may be extended so as to act on related objects (an operator that acts on functions may act also on [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") whose solutions are functions that satisfy the equation). (see [Operator (physics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(physics) "Operator (physics)") for other examples)

The most basic operators are [linear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map"), which act on [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"). Linear operators refer to linear maps whose domain and range are the same space, for example from ![Image 1: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) to ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics)#cite_note-Rudin-1973-Analysis-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics)#cite_note-Roman-2008-LinAlg-2)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics)#cite_note-3) Such operators often preserve properties, such as [continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"). For example, [differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiation_(mathematics) "Differentiation (mathematics)") and [indefinite integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_integration "Indefinite integration") are linear operators; operators that are built from them are called [differential operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator "Differential operator"), [integral operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_operator "Integral operator") or integro-differential operators.

**Operator** is also used for denoting the symbol of a [mathematical operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_operation "Mathematical operation"). This is related with the meaning of "operator" in [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming") (see [Operator (computer programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming) "Operator (computer programming)")).

The most common kind of operators encountered are _linear operators_. Let U and V be [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") over some [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")K. A [_mapping_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics) "Map (mathematics)")![Image 3: {\displaystyle \operatorname {A} :U\to V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a5b35790c771c2300ca507737eae75682d6bbb43) is [_linear_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_(mathematics) "Linear (mathematics)") if ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \operatorname {A} \left(\alpha \mathbf {x} +\beta \mathbf {y} \right)=\alpha \operatorname {A} \mathbf {x} +\beta \operatorname {A} \mathbf {y} \ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f077ba047d7564537d25b2f61c4c01433a42c38) for all **x** and **y** in U, and for all _α_, _β_ in K.

This means that a linear operator preserves vector space operations, in the sense that it does not matter whether you apply the linear operator before or after the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In more technical words, linear operators are [morphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism "Morphism") between vector spaces. In the finite-dimensional case linear operators can be represented by [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)") in the following way. Let K be a field, and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle U}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025) and V be finite-dimensional vector spaces over K. Let us select a basis ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \ \mathbf {u} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {u} _{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/097994cbc24915bc1efcdb47473789c74cbde864) in U and ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {v} _{m}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f3cf3f00c357feeaeb05faad45baeb25f14ae28) in V. Then let ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =x^{i}\mathbf {u} _{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0052cdba6882d1637320ee152f063bdec71b10ae) be an arbitrary vector in ![Image 9: {\displaystyle U}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025) (assuming [Einstein convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_convention "Einstein convention")), and ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \operatorname {A} :U\to V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a5b35790c771c2300ca507737eae75682d6bbb43) be a linear operator. Then![Image 11: {\displaystyle \ \operatorname {A} \mathbf {x} =x^{i}\operatorname {A} \mathbf {u} _{i}=x^{i}\left(\operatorname {A} \mathbf {u} _{i}\right)^{j}\mathbf {v} _{j}~.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8f9dba3230ab4a71f2c32cd6da8987c170de156c) Then ![Image 12: {\displaystyle a_{i}^{j}\equiv \left(\operatorname {A} \mathbf {u} _{i}\right)^{j}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/77a45ef2ef82119ffdc8970ec2c6241c8fabb6bd), with all ![Image 13: {\displaystyle a_{i}^{j}\in K}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ea45d707b6eb0ecf5851cd9f038224f3715949cf), is the matrix form of the operator ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \operatorname {A} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed223b8026ea5bea4ea00b2de392ba209ee13b94) in the fixed basis ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \{\mathbf {u} _{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c2a71a8a6173cdb91cde083aa22c3b5ed11368cd). The tensor ![Image 16: {\displaystyle a_{i}^{j}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a61dc7f80b9df12ba3f966089348ddf271fdb59e) does not depend on the choice of ![Image 17: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4), and ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \operatorname {A} \mathbf {x} =\mathbf {y} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8473cba896ec83910a13bfdf8266ab5c1594d57f) if ![Image 19: {\displaystyle a_{i}^{j}x^{i}=y^{j}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a87531d32f1041ff2abb01d4c0bc9838934f7d9d). Thus in fixed bases n-by-m matrices are in [bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective "Bijective") correspondence to linear operators from ![Image 20: {\displaystyle U}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025) to ![Image 21: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845).

The important concepts directly related to operators between finite-dimensional vector spaces are the ones of [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_rank "Matrix rank"), [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant"), [inverse operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_operator "Inverse operator"), and [eigenspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenspace "Eigenspace").

Linear operators also play a great role in the infinite-dimensional case. The concepts of rank and determinant cannot be extended to infinite-dimensional matrices. This is why very different techniques are employed when studying linear operators (and operators in general) in the infinite-dimensional case. The study of linear operators in the infinite-dimensional case is known as [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis") (so called because various classes of functions form interesting examples of infinite-dimensional vector spaces).

The space of [sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") of real numbers, or more generally sequences of vectors in any vector space, themselves form an infinite-dimensional vector space. The most important cases are sequences of real or complex numbers, and these spaces, together with linear subspaces, are known as [sequence spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_space "Sequence space"). Operators on these spaces are known as [sequence transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_transformation "Sequence transformation").

Bounded linear operators over a [Banach space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space "Banach space") form a [Banach algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_algebra "Banach algebra") in respect to the standard operator norm. The theory of Banach algebras develops a very general concept of [spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(functional_analysis) "Spectrum (functional analysis)") that elegantly generalizes the theory of eigenspaces.

Let U and V be two vector spaces over the same [ordered field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field "Ordered field") (for example; ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)), and they are equipped with [norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics) "Norm (mathematics)"). Then a linear operator from U to V is called **bounded** if there exists _c_> 0 such that ![Image 23: {\displaystyle \|\operatorname {A} \mathbf {x} \|_{V}\leq c\ \|\mathbf {x} \|_{U}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7d34ed0b7602b4c0fd888d653204f0059ac6e2fc) for every **x** in U. Bounded operators form a vector space. On this vector space we can introduce a norm that is compatible with the norms of U and V: ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \|\operatorname {A} \|=\inf\{\ c:\|\operatorname {A} \mathbf {x} \|_{V}\leq c\ \|\mathbf {x} \|_{U}\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/343f54be7ab5c123ef6a97f75535578dde79a543) In case of operators from U to itself it can be shown that

![Image 25: {\textstyle \|\operatorname {A} \operatorname {B} \|\leq \|\operatorname {A} \|\cdot \|\operatorname {B} \|}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4827b6f97c74778c3d90cb1b75f1eb3d9f416c13).[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics)#cite_note-4)
Any unital [normed algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_algebra "Normed algebra") with this property is called a [Banach algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_algebra "Banach algebra"). It is possible to generalize [spectral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory "Spectral theory") to such algebras. [C*-algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C*-algebra "C*-algebra"), which are [Banach algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_algebras "Banach algebras") with some additional structure, play an important role in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics").

### Analysis (calculus)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operator_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Analysis (calculus)")]

From the point of view of [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis"), [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") is the study of two linear operators: the [differential operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator "Differential operator")![Image 26: {\displaystyle {\frac {\ \mathrm {d} \ }{\mathrm {d} t}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ec247b367fea46b038381d4d94793c5327fef73), and the _[Volterra operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volterra\_operator "Volterra operator")_![Image 27: {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{t}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6d153a783e34463de11d4444f6dee413bdea3c9b).

### Fundamental analysis operators on scalar and vector fields

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operator_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Fundamental analysis operators on scalar and vector fields")]

Three operators are key to [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus "Vector calculus"):

As an extension of vector calculus operators to physics, engineering and tensor spaces, grad, div and curl operators also are often associated with [tensor calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_calculus "Tensor calculus") as well as vector calculus.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics)#cite_note-Schey-2005-5)

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), additional structures on [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") are sometimes studied. Operators that map such vector spaces to themselves [bijectively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective "Bijective") are very useful in these studies, they naturally form [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") by composition.

For example, bijective operators preserving the structure of a vector space are precisely the [invertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_function "Invertible function")[linear operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_operator "Linear operator"). They form the [general linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group") under composition. However, they _do not_ form a vector space under operator addition; since, for example, both the identity and −identity are [invertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible "Invertible") (bijective), but their sum, 0, is not.

Operators preserving the [Euclidean metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_metric "Euclidean metric") on such a space form the [isometry group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry_group "Isometry group"), and those that fix the origin form a subgroup known as the [orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group"). Operators in the orthogonal group that also preserve the orientation of vector tuples form the [special orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group"), or the group of rotations.

Operators are also involved in probability theory, such as [expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value "Expected value"), [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance "Variance"), and [covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance "Covariance"), which are used to name both number statistics and the operators which produce them. Indeed, every covariance is basically a [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product"): Every variance is a dot product of a vector with itself, and thus is a [quadratic norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_norm "Quadratic norm"); every standard deviation is a norm (square root of the quadratic norm); the corresponding cosine to this dot product is the [Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient "Pearson correlation coefficient"); expected value is basically an integral operator (used to measure weighted shapes in the space).

#### Fourier series and Fourier transform

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operator_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Fourier series and Fourier transform")]

The Fourier transform is useful in applied mathematics, particularly physics and signal processing. It is another integral operator; it is useful mainly because it converts a function on one (temporal) domain to a function on another (frequency) domain, in a way effectively [invertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_function "Invertible function"). No information is lost, as there is an inverse transform operator. In the simple case of [periodic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function "Periodic function"), this result is based on the theorem that any continuous periodic function can be represented as the sum of a series of [sine waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave "Sine wave") and cosine waves:![Image 28: {\displaystyle f(t)={\frac {\ a_{0}\ }{2}}+\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\ a_{n}\cos(\omega \ n\ t)+b_{n}\sin(\omega \ n\ t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01b659852e92e257343c9339f6e34b6e0f4f066c) The tuple ( _a_ 0, _a_ 1, _b_ 1, _a_ 2, _b_ 2, ... ) is in fact an element of an infinite-dimensional vector space [_ℓ_ 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_space "Sequence space"), and thus Fourier series is a linear operator.

When dealing with general function ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b61e241d66433d0f8d65669666d18cb90a8d9572), the transform takes on an [integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") form:

![Image 30: {\displaystyle f(t)={1 \over {\sqrt {2\pi }}}\int _{-\infty }^{+\infty }{g(\omega )\ e^{i\ \omega \ t}\ \mathrm {d} \ \omega }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70bc75e4d619c6112a43129fd48e45dec502c1a8)
The _Laplace transform_ is another integral operator and is involved in simplifying the process of solving differential equations.

Given _f_ = _f_(_s_), it is defined by:![Image 31: {\displaystyle F(s)=\operatorname {\mathcal {L}} \{f\}(s)=\int _{0}^{\infty }e^{-s\ t}\ f(t)\ \mathrm {d} \ t}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d417ddadd1a50cbcc9afe09fd97e26c3c78a246f)

The set of all linear operators on V is denoted _ℒ_(_V_). A linear operator on a real vector space is called a _real operator_ and a linear operator on a complex vector space is called a _complex operator_. ... We should also mention that some authors use the term linear operator for any linear transformation from V to W. ... _Definition:_ The following terms are also employed: (2) _endomorphism_ for linear operator ...(6) _automorphism_ for bijective linear operator. — Roman (2008)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics)#cite_note-Roman-2008-LinAlg-2)
