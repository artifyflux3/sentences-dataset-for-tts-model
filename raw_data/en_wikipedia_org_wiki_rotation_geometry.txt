Rotation of an object in two dimensions around a point O.

**Rotation** in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") is a concept originating in [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"). Any rotation is a [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(geometry) "Motion (geometry)") of a certain [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)") that preserves at least one [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)"). It can describe, for example, the motion of a [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") around a fixed point. Rotation can have a [sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(mathematics) "Sign (mathematics)") (as in the [sign of an angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle#Sign "Angle")): a clockwise rotation is a negative magnitude so a counterclockwise turn has a positive magnitude. A rotation is different from other types of motions: [translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)"), which have no fixed points, and [(hyperplane) reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)"), each of them having an entire (_n_ − 1)-dimensional [flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_(geometry) "Flat (geometry)") of fixed points in a n-[dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(mathematics) "Dimension (mathematics)") space.

Mathematically, a rotation is a [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics) "Map (mathematics)"). All rotations about a fixed point form a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") under [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") called the **rotation group** (of a particular space). But in [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics") and, more generally, in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), this concept is frequently understood as a [coordinate transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_transformation "Coordinate transformation") (importantly, a transformation of an [orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis "Orthonormal basis")), because for any motion of a body there is an inverse transformation which if applied to the [frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference") results in the body being at the same coordinates. For example, in two dimensions rotating a body [clockwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwise "Clockwise") about a point keeping the axes fixed is equivalent to rotating the axes counterclockwise about the same point while the body is kept fixed. These two types of rotation are called [active and passive transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_and_passive_transformation "Active and passive transformation").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#cite_note-2)

The _rotation group_ is a [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") of rotations about a [fixed point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#Fixed_points_and_stabilizer_subgroups "Group action (mathematics)"). This (common) fixed point or [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(geometry) "Center (geometry)") is called the **center of rotation** and is usually identified with the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)"). The rotation group is a _[point stabilizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group\_action\_(mathematics)#Fixed\_points\_and\_stabilizer\_subgroups "Group action (mathematics)")_ in a broader group of (orientation-preserving) [motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(geometry) "Motion (geometry)").

For a particular rotation:

*   The _[axis of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis\_of\_rotation "Axis of rotation")_ is a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") of its fixed points. They exist only in _n_ = 3.
*   The _[plane of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane\_of\_rotation "Plane of rotation")_ is a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") that is [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#Invariant_subsets "Group action (mathematics)") under the rotation. Unlike the axis, its points are not fixed themselves. The axis (where present) and the plane of a rotation are [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal "Orthogonal").

A _representation_ of rotations is a particular formalism, either algebraic or geometric, used to parametrize a rotation map. This meaning is somehow inverse to [the meaning in the group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation "Group representation").

Rotations of [(affine) spaces of points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") and of respective [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") are not always clearly distinguished. The former are sometimes referred to as _affine rotations_ (although the term is misleading), whereas the latter are _vector rotations_. See the article below for details.

### In Euclidean geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: In Euclidean geometry")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Rotation4.svg/250px-Rotation4.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rotation4.svg)

A plane rotation around a point followed by another rotation around a different point results in a total motion which is either a rotation (as in this picture), or a [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)").

A motion of a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") is the same as its [isometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry"): it leaves [the distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance") between any two points unchanged after the transformation. But a (proper) rotation also has to preserve the [orientation structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(vector_space) "Orientation (vector space)"). The "[improper rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_rotation "Improper rotation")" term refers to isometries that reverse (flip) the orientation. In the language of [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory") the distinction is expressed as _direct_ vs _indirect_ isometries in the [Euclidean group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group "Euclidean group"), where the former comprise the [identity component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_component "Identity component"). Any direct Euclidean motion can be represented as a composition of a rotation about the fixed point and a translation.

In [one-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional_space "One-dimensional space"), there are only [trivial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triviality_(mathematics) "Triviality (mathematics)") rotations. In [two dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)"), only a single [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") is needed to specify a rotation about the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)") – the _angle of rotation_ that specifies an element of the [circle group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_group "Circle group") (also known as U(1)). The rotation is acting to rotate an object [counterclockwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterclockwise "Counterclockwise") through an angle θ about the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)"); see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#Two_dimensions) for details. Composition of rotations [sums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation "Summation") their angles [modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic "Modular arithmetic") 1 [turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry) "Turn (geometry)"), which implies that all two-dimensional rotations about _the same_ point [commute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group "Abelian group"). Rotations about _different_ points, in general, do not commute. Any two-dimensional direct motion is either a translation or a rotation; see [Euclidean plane isometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane_isometry "Euclidean plane isometry") for details.

Euler rotations of the Earth. Intrinsic (green), precession (blue) and nutation (red)

Rotations in [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") differ from those in two dimensions in a number of important ways. Rotations in three dimensions are generally not [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative "Commutative"), so the order in which rotations are applied is important even about the same point. Also, unlike the two-dimensional case, a three-dimensional direct motion, in [general position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_position "General position"), is not a rotation but a [screw operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_axis "Screw axis"). Rotations about the origin have three degrees of freedom (see [rotation formalisms in three dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_formalisms_in_three_dimensions "Rotation formalisms in three dimensions") for details), the same as the number of dimensions. A three-dimensional rotation can be specified in a number of ways. The most usual methods are:

*   [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles") (pictured at the left). Any rotation about the origin can be represented as the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") of three rotations defined as the motion obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. They constitute a **mixed axes of rotation** system because angles are measured with respect to a mix of different [reference frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_frames "Reference frames"), rather than a single frame that is purely external or purely intrinsic. Specifically, the first angle moves the [line of nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_nodes "Line of nodes") around the external axis _z_, the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third is an intrinsic rotation (a spin) around an axis fixed in the body that moves. Euler angles are typically denoted as [_α_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha "Alpha"), [_β_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta "Beta"), [_γ_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma "Gamma"), or [_φ_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi "Phi"), [_θ_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta "Theta"), [_ψ_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psi_(letter) "Psi (letter)"). This presentation is convenient only for rotations about a fixed point.

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Euler_AxisAngle.png/120px-Euler_AxisAngle.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Euler_AxisAngle.png)

*   [Axis–angle representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis%E2%80%93angle_representation "Axis–angle representation") (pictured at the right) specifies an angle with the axis about which the rotation takes place. It can be easily visualised. There are two variants to represent it: 
    *   as a pair consisting of the angle and a [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") for the axis, or
    *   as a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") obtained by multiplying the angle with this unit vector, called the _rotation vector_ (although, strictly speaking, it is a [pseudovector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector "Pseudovector")).

*   Matrices, versors (quaternions), and other [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") things: see the section [_Linear and Multilinear Algebra Formalism_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#Linear_and_multilinear_algebra_formalism) for details.

A perspective projection onto three-dimensions of a [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract "Tesseract") being rotated in four-dimensional Euclidean space.

A general rotation in [four dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space "Four-dimensional space") has only one fixed point, the centre of rotation, and no axis of rotation; see [rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space "Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space") for details. Instead the rotation has two mutually orthogonal planes of rotation, each of which is fixed in the sense that points in each plane stay within the planes. The rotation has two angles of rotation, one for each [plane of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_of_rotation "Plane of rotation"), through which points in the planes rotate. If these are _ω_ 1 and _ω_ 2 then all points not in the planes rotate through an angle between _ω_ 1 and _ω_ 2. Rotations in four dimensions about a fixed point have six degrees of freedom. A four-dimensional direct motion in general position _is_ a rotation about certain point (as in all [even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_number "Even number") Euclidean dimensions), but screw operations exist also.

### Linear and multilinear algebra formalism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Linear and multilinear algebra formalism")]

When one considers motions of the Euclidean space that preserve [the origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)"), the [distinction between points and vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point%E2%80%93vector_distinction "Point–vector distinction"), important in pure mathematics, can be erased because there is a canonical [one-to-one correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_correspondence "One-to-one correspondence") between points and [position vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(vector) "Position (vector)"). The same is true for geometries other than [Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), but whose space is an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") with a supplementary [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure "Mathematical structure"); see [an example below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#In_relativity). Alternatively, the vector description of rotations can be understood as a parametrization of geometric rotations [up to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to "Up to") their composition with translations. In other words, one vector rotation presents many [equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") rotations about _all_ points in the space.

A motion that preserves the origin is the same as a [linear operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_operator "Linear operator") on vectors that preserves the same geometric structure but expressed in terms of vectors. For [Euclidean vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector"), this expression is their _magnitude_ ([Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm "Euclidean norm")). In [components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space "Real coordinate space"), such operator is expressed with _n_ × _n_[orthogonal matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix "Orthogonal matrix") that is multiplied to [column vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_vector "Column vector").

As it [was already stated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#In_Euclidean_geometry), a (proper) rotation is different from an arbitrary fixed-point motion in its preservation of the orientation of the vector space. Thus, the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") of a rotation orthogonal matrix must be 1. The only other possibility for the determinant of an orthogonal matrix is [−1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%88%921_(number) "−1 (number)"), and this result means the transformation is a [hyperplane reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)"), a [point reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_reflection "Point reflection") (for [odd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_number "Odd number")n), or another kind of [improper rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_rotation "Improper rotation"). Matrices of all proper rotations form the [special orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group").

In two dimensions, to carry out a rotation using a matrix, the point (_x_, _y_) to be rotated counterclockwise is written as a column vector, then multiplied by a [rotation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix "Rotation matrix") calculated from the angle _θ_:

![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}x'\\y'\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta &-\sin \theta \\\sin \theta &\cos \theta \end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ce3876bf4508c83d02b14167bd66b177ded69651).
The coordinates of the point after rotation are _x′_, _y′_, and the formulae for x′ and y′ are

![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x'&=x\cos \theta -y\sin \theta \\y'&=x\sin \theta +y\cos \theta .\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4e8193cc301ba228063af7ecdf292c2b8c7e76d3)
The vectors ![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca2fe242ff71ae9e45a2ea78f5b3a1b48b44e84e) and ![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}x'\\y'\end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/58d26d226b2576df72e4bd80ca88d56fa4a711eb) have the same magnitude and are separated by an angle θ as expected.

Points on the **R**2 plane can be also presented as [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number"): the point (_x_, _y_) in the plane is represented by the complex number

![Image 10: {\displaystyle z=x+iy}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/08e90bb6b36fef59c6113eed2a08f10d77240741)
This can be rotated through an angle θ by multiplying it by _e_ _iθ_, then expanding the product using [Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula "Euler's formula") as follows:

![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}e^{i\theta }z&=(\cos \theta +i\sin \theta )(x+iy)\\&=x\cos \theta +iy\cos \theta +ix\sin \theta -y\sin \theta \\&=(x\cos \theta -y\sin \theta )+i(x\sin \theta +y\cos \theta )\\&=x'+iy',\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e5cea8b97b9bdf8556efdeef8276f2a99979cff)
and equating real and imaginary parts gives the same result as a two-dimensional matrix:

![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x'&=x\cos \theta -y\sin \theta \\y'&=x\sin \theta +y\cos \theta .\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4e8193cc301ba228063af7ecdf292c2b8c7e76d3)
Since complex numbers form a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring"), vector rotations in two dimensions are commutative, unlike in higher dimensions. They have only one [degree of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics) "Degrees of freedom (mechanics)"), as such rotations are entirely determined by the angle of rotation.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#cite_note-3)

As in two dimensions, a matrix can be used to rotate a point (_x_, _y_, _z_) to a point (_x′_, _y′_, _z′_). The matrix used is a 3×3 matrix,

![Image 13: {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} ={\begin{pmatrix}a&b&c\\d&e&f\\g&h&i\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e49d2f60405fddb3d7cf7b03143d6bb800475ea)
This is multiplied by a vector representing the point to give the result

![Image 14: {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} {\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}a&b&c\\d&e&f\\g&h&i\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}x'\\y'\\z'\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7f32d668cc6edb290dc42e8e00db30dda68c1e29)
The set of all appropriate matrices together with the operation of [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication "Matrix multiplication") is the [rotation group SO(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_group_SO(3) "Rotation group SO(3)"). The matrix **A** is a member of the three-dimensional [special orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group"), SO(3), that is it is an [orthogonal matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix "Orthogonal matrix") with [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") 1. That it is an orthogonal matrix means that its rows are a set of orthogonal [unit vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") (so they are an [orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis "Orthonormal basis")) as are its columns, making it simple to spot and check if a matrix is a valid rotation matrix.

[Above-mentioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#Euler_angles) Euler angles and axis–angle representations can be easily converted to a rotation matrix.

Another possibility to represent a rotation of three-dimensional Euclidean vectors are quaternions described below.

Unit [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion"), or _[versors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versor "Versor")_, are in some ways the least intuitive representation of three-dimensional rotations. They are not the three-dimensional instance of a general approach. They are more compact than matrices and easier to work with than all other methods, so are often preferred in real-world applications.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

A versor (also called a _rotation quaternion_) consists of four real numbers, constrained so the [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space "Normed vector space") of the quaternion is 1. This constraint limits the degrees of freedom of the quaternion to three, as required. Unlike matrices and complex numbers two multiplications are needed:

![Image 15: {\displaystyle \mathbf {x'} =\mathbf {qxq} ^{-1},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c2cc9b047d065aa1018708866d17697d69ec3d44)
where **q** is the versor, **q**−1 is its [inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse"), and **x** is the vector treated as a quaternion with zero [scalar part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion#Scalar_and_vector_parts "Quaternion"). The quaternion can be related to the rotation vector form of the axis angle rotation by the [exponential map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_map_(Lie_theory) "Exponential map (Lie theory)") over the quaternions,

![Image 16: {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} =e^{\mathbf {v} /2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b294012ab321f94897fb6e0b76468293d1d87fd2)
where **v** is the rotation vector treated as a quaternion.

A single multiplication by a versor, [either left or right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_and_right_(algebra) "Left and right (algebra)"), is itself a rotation, but in four dimensions. Any four-dimensional rotation about the origin can be represented with two quaternion multiplications: one left and one right, by two _different_ unit quaternions.

More generally, coordinate rotations in any dimension are represented by orthogonal matrices. The set of all orthogonal matrices in n dimensions which describe proper rotations (determinant = +1), together with the operation of matrix multiplication, forms the [special orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group")SO(_n_).

Matrices are often used for doing transformations, especially when a large number of points are being transformed, as they are a direct representation of the [linear operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map"). Rotations represented in other ways are often converted to matrices before being used. They can be extended to represent rotations and transformations at the same time using [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates "Homogeneous coordinates"). [Projective transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_transformation "Projective transformation") are represented by 4×4 matrices. They are not rotation matrices, but a transformation that represents a Euclidean rotation has a 3×3 rotation matrix in the upper left corner.

The main disadvantage of matrices is that they are more expensive to calculate and do calculations with. Also in calculations where [numerical instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_stability "Numerical stability") is a concern matrices can be more prone to it, so calculations to restore [orthonormality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormality "Orthonormality"), which are expensive to do for matrices, need to be done more often.

#### More alternatives to the matrix formalism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: More alternatives to the matrix formalism")]

As was demonstrated above, there exist three [multilinear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_algebra "Multilinear algebra") rotation formalisms: one with [U(1), or complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#Complex_numbers), for two dimensions, and two others with [versors, or quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#Quaternions), for three and four dimensions.

In general (even for vectors equipped with a non-Euclidean Minkowski [quadratic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form "Quadratic form")) the rotation of a vector space can be expressed as a [bivector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector "Bivector"). This formalism is used in [geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra") and, more generally, in the [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra") representation of Lie groups.

In the case of a positive-definite Euclidean quadratic form, the double [covering group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_group "Covering group") of the isometry group ![Image 17: {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9fa71842f19b6810b4bfa9eb282e92fbf285094e) is known as the [Spin group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_group "Spin group"), ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \mathrm {Spin} (n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/715ebb906dd12ecfd51f9767398fdf9ed0d3cc7f). It can be conveniently described in terms of a Clifford algebra. Unit quaternions give the group ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \mathrm {Spin} (3)\cong \mathrm {SU} (2)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/90630a7fca0ae705633a4634b8bcd8c691638072).

### In non-Euclidean geometries

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: In non-Euclidean geometries")]

In [spherical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry"), a direct motion[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] of the [n-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere "N-sphere") (an example of the [elliptic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry "Elliptic geometry")) is the same as a rotation of (_n_ + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space about the origin (SO(_n_ + 1)). For odd n, most of these motions do not have fixed points on the n-sphere and, strictly speaking, are not rotations _of the sphere_; such motions are sometimes referred to as _[Clifford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William\_Kingdon\_Clifford "William Kingdon Clifford") translations_.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Rotations about a fixed point in elliptic and [hyperbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space "Hyperbolic space") geometries are not different from Euclidean ones.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]

[Affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry") and [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry") have not a distinct notion of rotation.

A generalization of a rotation applies in [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"), where it can be considered to operate on a four-dimensional space, [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), spanned by three space dimensions and one of time. In special relativity, this space is called [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"), and the four-dimensional rotations, called [Lorentz transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation "Lorentz transformation"), have a physical interpretation. These transformations preserve a quadratic form called the [spacetime interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_interval "Spacetime interval").

If a rotation of Minkowski space is in a space-like plane, then this rotation is the same as a spatial rotation in Euclidean space. By contrast, a rotation in a plane spanned by a space-like dimension and a time-like dimension is a [hyperbolic rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_rotation "Hyperbolic rotation"), and if this plane contains the time axis of the reference frame, is called a "Lorentz boost". These transformations demonstrate the [pseudo-Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Euclidean_space "Pseudo-Euclidean space") nature of the Minkowski space. Hyperbolic rotations are sometimes described as "[squeeze mappings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_mapping "Squeeze mapping")" and frequently appear on [Minkowski diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_diagram "Minkowski diagram") that visualize (1 + 1)-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean geometry on planar drawings. The study of relativity deals with the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group "Lorentz group") generated by the space rotations and hyperbolic rotations.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#cite_note-4)

Whereas SO(3) rotations, in physics and astronomy, correspond to rotations of [celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere "Celestial sphere") as a [2-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") in the Euclidean 3-space, Lorentz transformations from SO(3;1)+ induce [conformal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map "Conformal map") transformations of the celestial sphere. It is a broader class of the sphere transformations known as [Möbius transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation "Möbius transformation").

Rotations define important classes of [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry"): [rotational symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_symmetry "Rotational symmetry") is an [invariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics) "Invariant (mathematics)") with respect to a _particular rotation_. The [circular symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_symmetry "Circular symmetry") is an invariance with respect to all rotation about the fixed axis.

As was stated above, Euclidean rotations are applied to [rigid body dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body_dynamics "Rigid body dynamics"). Moreover, most of mathematical formalism in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") (such as the [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus "Vector calculus")) is rotation-invariant; see [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation") for more physical aspects. Euclidean rotations and, more generally, Lorentz symmetry [described above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#In_relativity) are thought to be [symmetry laws of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(physics) "Symmetry (physics)"). In contrast, the [reflectional symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics) "Parity (physics)") is not a precise symmetry law of nature.

The [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number")-valued matrices analogous to real orthogonal matrices are the [unitary matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix "Unitary matrix")![Image 21: {\displaystyle \mathrm {U} (n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a32fa84df5de5dfa91b6bdc88fb03fc8792c9f81), which represent rotations in complex space. The set of all unitary matrices in a given dimension n forms a [unitary group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_group "Unitary group")![Image 22: {\displaystyle \mathrm {U} (n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a32fa84df5de5dfa91b6bdc88fb03fc8792c9f81) of degree n; and its subgroup representing proper rotations (those that preserve the orientation of space) is the [special unitary group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group "Special unitary group")![Image 23: {\displaystyle \mathrm {SU} (n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e8a205091aabd5690efdfeb7354a55844f2eb31b) of degree n. These complex rotations are important in the context of [spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor "Spinor"). The elements of ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \mathrm {SU} (2)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4478ef936fe905a135afac8386be77964b8bb448) are used to parametrize _three_-dimensional Euclidean rotations (see [above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry)#Quaternions)), as well as respective transformations of the [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)") (see [representation theory of SU(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_SU(2) "Representation theory of SU(2)")).
