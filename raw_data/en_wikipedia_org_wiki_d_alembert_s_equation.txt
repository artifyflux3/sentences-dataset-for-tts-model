The equation reads as [ 2 ] y = x f ( d y d x ) + g ( d y d x ) .

{\displaystyle y=xf\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)+g\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right).} After differentiating once, and rearranging with p = d y / d x {\displaystyle p=dy/dx} , we have d x d p + x f ′ ( p ) + g ′ ( p ) f ( p ) − − p = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{dp}}+{\frac {xf'(p)+g'(p)}{f(p)-p}}=0} The above equation is linear. When f ( p ) = p {\displaystyle f(p)=p} , d'Alembert's equation is reduced to Clairaut's equation .
