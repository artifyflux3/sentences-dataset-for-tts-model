He was also a revolutionary and the brother of physician and philosopher Ludwig Büchner . His literary achievements, though limited, are generally held in great esteem in Germany . Many believe that had he not died young, he might have joined such central German literary figures as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller at the summit of their profession.

[ citation needed ] At the age of 21, Büchner wrote an essay entitled Hessian Courier was called the most revolutionary manifesto of the 19th century before the Communist Manifesto.

[ 1 ] Life and career [ edit ] Born in Goddelau (now part of Riedstadt ) in the Grand Duchy of Hesse as the son of a physician, Büchner attended the Darmstadt gymnasium , a humanistic secondary school.

[ 2 ] In 1828, he became interested in politics and joined a circle of William Shakespeare aficionados, which later on probably became the Giessen and Darmstadt section of the Society for Human Rights ( Gesellschaft für Menschenrechte ).

In 1831, at age 18, he began to study medicine in Strasbourg . In Strasbourg, he immersed himself in French literature and political thought. He was influenced by the utopian communist theories of François-Noël Babeuf and Claude Henri de Saint-Simon . In 1833, he moved to Giessen and continued his studies at the local university .

Büchner in a 1833/34 drawing by his friend Alexis Muston While Büchner continued his studies in Giessen, he established a secret society dedicated to the revolutionary cause. In July 1834, with the help of evangelical theologian Friedrich Ludwig Weidig , he published the leaflet Der Hessische Landbote , a revolutionary pamphlet critical of social injustice in the Grand Duchy of Hesse . The authorities charged them with treason and issued a warrant for their arrest. Weidig was arrested, tortured and later died in prison in Darmstadt; Büchner managed to flee across the border to Strasbourg, where he wrote most of his literary work and translated two French plays by Victor Hugo , Lucrèce Borgia and Marie Tudor . Two years later, his medical dissertation, "Mémoire sur le Système Nerveux du Barbeaux (Cyprinus barbus L.)" was published in Paris and Strasbourg. In October 1836, after receiving his M.D. and being appointed by the University of Zürich as a lecturer in anatomy, Büchner relocated to Zürich , where he spent his final months writing and teaching until his death from typhus at the age of twenty-three.

Gravestone of Georg Büchner on Germaniahügel in Zürich- Oberstrass His first play, Dantons Tod ( Danton's Death ), about the French Revolution , was published in 1835, followed by Lenz (first partly published in Karl Gutzkow 's and Wienberg's Deutsche Revue , which was quickly banned).

Lenz is a novella based on the life of the Sturm und Drang poet Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz . In 1836, his second play, Leonce and Lena , satirized the nobility. His unfinished and most famous play, Woyzeck , exists only in fragments and was published posthumously.

Legacy [ edit ] By the 1870s, Büchner was nearly forgotten in Germany when Karl Emil Franzos edited his works; these later became a major influence on the naturalist and expressionist movements.

Arnold Zweig described Lenz , Büchner's only work of prose fiction, as "the beginning of modern European prose".

The play Woyzeck became the basis for many adaptations, including Alban Berg 's landmark atonal opera Wozzeck , which premiered in 1925, and Werner Herzog 's 1979 film Woyzeck (see main article, Woyzeck , for a full list).

Woyzeck has been included in the curriculum for students in grade 12 in Germany .

A German literary Georg Büchner Prize , is awarded annually. It was created in 1923.
