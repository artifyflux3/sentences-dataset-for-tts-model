Entries for moonwalks are shown with a gray background while entries for all other EVAs are uncolored.

All spacewalks have had the astronauts tethered to their spacecraft except for seven spacewalks by the United States (six in 1984 using the Manned Maneuvering Unit , and one in 1994 testing the SAFER rescue device). All moonwalks were performed with astronauts untethered, and some of the astronauts traveled far enough to lose visual contact with their craft (they were up to 7.6 km away from it using the Lunar Roving Vehicle ). One lunar EVA was not a moonwalk, but rather a stand-up EVA partially out the top hatch of the LM, where it was thought that the extra height would help with surveying the area prior to conducting the moonwalks. Only three deep-space EVAs have ever been conducted, where the activity was neither on the lunar surface nor in low Earth orbit , but far away from both the Moon and the Earth.

1965–1969 spacewalks and moonwalks [ edit ] Spacewalk beginning and ending times are given in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

# Spacecraft Spacewalkers Start ( UTC ) End (UTC) Duration 1.

Voskhod 2 Alexei Leonov 18 March 1965 08:34:51 18 March 1965 08:47:00 0 h 12 min Leonov conducted the first EVA in history.

[ 1 ] Leonov had difficulty fitting back into the spacecraft due to spacesuit stiffness in vacuum, and vented air from his spacesuit in order to bend back into the capsule.

[ 2 ] 2.

Gemini 4 Ed White James A. McDivitt (did not exit) 3 June 1965 19:46:00 3 June 1965 20:06:00 0 h 20 min White conducted the second EVA in history and the first American EVA.

[ 3 ] White also had difficulty returning to the Gemini spacecraft. Although he was very fit and athletic, the effort left him exhausted.

[ 4 ] While McDivitt did not exit, he was exposed to the vacuum of space in the spacecraft. White spent 20 minutes outside the capsule, the capsule's hatch was open for 36 minutes and the capsule was depressurized for 46 minutes.

Gemini 9A Eugene Cernan Thomas P. Stafford (did not exit) 5 June 1966 15:02:00 5 June 1966 17:09:00 2 h 7 min A complex work EVA was planned for Cernan, which involved him moving to the rear of the Gemini spacecraft and donning the Astronaut propulsion unit , developed by the U.S. Air Force .

[ 6 ] Cernan expended four to five times the expected effort, raising his pulse as high as 180 beats per minute. Excess heat and respiration completely fogged Cernan's visor, and the EVA was cut short. Cernan also had difficulty returning to the spacecraft and closing the hatch.

[ 7 ] 4.

Gemini 10 EVA 1 Michael Collins John Young (did not exit) 19 July 1966 21:44:00 19 July 1966 22:33:00 0 h 49 min Collins performed a stand-up EVA. Instead of climbing completely out of the spacecraft, Collins extended his torso outside the spacecraft to take photos before and after capsule sunrise. Color photography after sunrise was only partly completed due to severe eye irritation of both Collins and Command Pilot Young . Handling the camera proved difficult due to the stiffness of Collins' gloves.

[ 8 ] 5.

Gemini 10 EVA 2 Michael Collins John Young (did not exit) 20 July 1966 23:01:00 20 July 1966 23:40:00 0 h 39 min Collins performed an umbilical EVA. With more difficulty than expected, Collins collected the micrometeorite collection package from the exterior of the Gemini spacecraft. Then, using the Hand Held Maneuvering Unit, he pushed to the nearby Agena Target Vehicle to collect its micrometeorite collection package. Collins then pulled on the umbilical cord to return and re-enter the spacecraft.

Gemini 12 EVA 1 Buzz Aldrin Jim Lovell (did not exit) 12 November 1966 16:15:00 12 November 1966 18:44:00 2 h 29 min Aldrin performed a stand-up EVA. Aldrin took UV still photos and 16 mm color movie pictures, collected external experimental samples, and conducted a light exercise routine.

[ 12 ] 9.

Gemini 12 EVA 2 Buzz Aldrin Jim Lovell (did not exit) 13 November 1966 15:34:00 13 November 1966 17:40:00 2 h 06 min Aldrin's walk was the first completely successful umbilical EVA, with all objectives achieved. He was able to control his movements and restrict his workload using techniques developed using underwater zero gravity simulations. Aldrin also benefited from the experiences of the previous American EVAs. Aldrin was able to move around the outside of the craft, deploy and recover various experimental packages, install and remove cameras, and practice work techniques using a ratchet-type wrench.

[ 13 ] 10.

Gemini 12 EVA 3 Buzz Aldrin Jim Lovell (did not exit) 14 November 1966 14:52:00 14 November 1966 15:47:00 0 h 55 min Aldrin performed another stand-up EVA. Aldrin again extended outside the hatch to take photographs and repeat the light exercise experiment. Exertion levels during exercise were comparable to preflight simulations. Equipment and waste food containers not needed for re-entry were jettisoned from the spacecraft.

[ 14 ] 11.

Soyuz 4 & Soyuz 5 Yevgeny Khrunov Aleksei Yeliseyev 16 January 1969 12:43:00 16 January 1969 13:15:00 0 h 32 min Khrunov and Yeliseyev conducted the first two-man spacewalk. Both cosmonauts launched in Soyuz 5, which then docked with Soyuz 4. Khrunov and Yeliseyev performed an EVA to transfer to Soyuz 4. Although docked together, Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 did not make an internal connection, necessitating the EVA. Khrunov and Yeliseyev returned to Earth aboard Soyuz 4.

Apollo 9 Rusty Schweickart David Scott (stand up only) James McDivitt (did not exit) 6 March 1969 16:45:00 6 March 1969 18:02:00 1 h 17 min Schweickart exited the lunar module hatch, wearing the portable life support system (PLSS) backpack. Schweickart's backpack provided oxygen, communications, and cooling, independent of his spacecraft. Scott extended out of the command module hatch but remained supported by the command module through an umbilical cord. Plans for Schweickart to move to the command module hatch were scrubbed due to severe space sickness he had suffered the day before.

Commemorative stamps [ edit ] The first spacewalk, that of the Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov was commemorated in several Eastern Bloc stamps (see the stamps section in the Alexei Leonov article). Since the Soviet Union did not distribute diagrams or images of the Voskhod 2 spacecraft at the time, the spaceship depiction in the stamps was purely fictional. In 1967 the U.S. Post Office issued a pair of postage stamps commemorating the first American to float freely in space while orbiting the Earth. The engraved image has accurate depictions of the Gemini IV spacecraft and the space suit worn by astronaut Ed White .

[ 151 ] Alexei Leonov, Voskhod 2, First Spacewalk U.S.S.R. commemorative issue of 1965 Accomplishments in Space U.S. commemorative issue of 1967 Two Forever Stamps were issued in 2019 to commemorate the first spacewalk's 50th anniversary. One features an iconic image of Buzz Aldrin performing an EVA , and the other an image of the Moon as viewed from Apollo 11 in space.
