Caen ( UK : / ˈ k ɒ̃ ˈ k ɒ n / ; French: [kɑ̃] ⓘ ; Norman : Kaem ) is a city and commune 15 km (9.3 mi) inland from the northwestern coast of France. It is the prefecture of the department of Calvados . The city proper has 105,512 inhabitants (as of 2018 [update] ), while its functional urban area has 470,000, [ 3 ] making Caen the second largest urban area in Normandy and the 19th largest in France.

[ 4 ] It is also the third largest commune in all of Normandy after Le Havre and Rouen .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Caen is located 200 km (120 mi) northwest of Paris, connected to the South of England by the Caen ( Ouistreham ) to Portsmouth ferry route through the English Channel . Situated a few miles from the coast, the landing beaches, the bustling resorts of Deauville and Cabourg , as well as Norman Switzerland and the Pays d'Auge , Caen is often considered the archetype of Normandy.

Caen is known for its historical buildings built during the reign of William the Conqueror , who was buried there, and for the Battle for Caen , heavy fighting that took place in and around Caen during the Battle of Normandy in 1944, destroying much of the city. The city has now preserved the memory by erecting a memorial and a museum dedicated to peace, the Mémorial de Caen .

Etymology [ edit ] The first references to the name of Caen are found in different acts of the dukes of Normandy : Cadon 1021/1025, [ 7 ] Cadumus 1025, [ 8 ] Cathim 1026/1027.

[ 9 ] Year 1070 of the Parker manuscript [ 10 ] of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle refers to Caen as Kadum , [ 11 ] and year 1086 of the Laud manuscript [ 12 ] gives the name as Caþum .

[ 13 ] Despite a lack of sources as to the origin of the settlements, the name Caen would seem to be of Gaulish origin, from the words catu- , referring to military activities and magos , field, hence meaning "manoeuvre field" or "battlefield".

[ 14 ] In Layamon 's Brut , the poet asserts that King Arthur named the city in memory of Sir Kay , [ 15 ] although the historicity of King Arthur is widely doubted.

History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of Caen Early history [ edit ] See also: History of Normandy This section does not cite any sources .

( November 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Caen was known in Roman times as 'Catumagos', from the Gaulish roots magos meaning 'field' and catu meaning 'combat'. It remained a minor settlement throughout the Roman period and began to see major development commence in the 10th century, under the patronage of the Dukes of Normandy. Around 1060, William the Conqueror began construction of the Château de Caen , which became the centre of the ducal court. Duchess Matilda of Flanders also founded the Benedictine Abbey of Sainte-Trinité, Caen around the same time, eventually being buried in the abbey. Caen succeeded Bayeux as the capital of Lower Normandy , complementing the second ducal capital of Rouen .

Caen fell to Philip II of France on 21 May 1204, and was incorporated along with the remainder of Normandy into the Kingdom of France.

Hundred Years' War [ edit ] Main article: Battle of Caen (1346) In 1346, King Edward III of England led his army against the city, hoping to loot it. It was expected that a siege of perhaps several weeks would be required, but the army took the city in less than a day, on 26 July 1346, storming and sacking it , killing 3,000 of its citizens, and burning much of the merchants' quarter on the Île St-Jean. Only the castle of Caen held out, despite attempts to besiege it. A few days later, the English left, marching to the east and on to their victory at the Battle of Crécy . It was later captured following a siege by Henry V in 1417 and treated harshly for being the first town to put up any resistance to his invasion. In 1450 towards the end of the war, French forces recaptured Caen .

World War II [ edit ] Main article: Battle for Caen A Canadian Army bulldozer in Caen, 1944. The towers of the Abbaye aux Hommes are behind.

During World War II , Caen was captured by German forces during the Battle of France in 1940 and placed under military occupation . In 1944, Allied forces launched Operation Overlord , invading German-occupied France and rapidly advancing through Normandy . From 6 June to 6 August 1944, the British Second Army fought the battle of Caen to dislodge German forces from the city. During the battle, Allied bombing raids heavily damaged the city and caused numerous French civilian casualties. After the battle, little of prewar Caen remained, and reconstruction efforts in the city continued until 1962.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] Postwar [ edit ] Postwar work included the reconstruction of complete districts of the city and the university campus. It took 14 years (1948–1962) and led to the current urbanization of Caen. Having lost many of its historic quarters and its university campus in the war, Caen does not have the atmosphere of a traditional Norman town such as Honfleur , Rouen , Cabourg , Deauville or Bayeux .

[ citation needed ] The Canadian Army Film and Photo Unit filmed the D-Day offensive and Orne breakout several weeks later. It returned several months later to document the city's recovery efforts. The resulting film, You Can't Kill a City , is preserved in the National Archives of Canada .

Geography [ edit ] Caen is in an area of high humidity. The river Orne flows through the city, as well as small rivers known as les Odons , most of which have been buried under the city to improve urban hygiene. Caen has a large flood zone, named "La prairie", located around the hippodrome, not far from the river Orne, which is regularly submerged.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Caen is 10 km (6.2 mi) from the Channel . A canal ( Canal de Caen à la Mer ) parallel to the Orne was built during the reign of Napoleon III to link the city to the sea at all times. The canal reaches the English Channel at Ouistreham . A lock keeps the tide out of the canal and lets large ships navigate up the canal to Caen's freshwater harbours.

Climate [ edit ] Caen has an oceanic climate that is somewhat ameliorated due to its slightly inland position. In spite of this, summers are still cool by French standards and the climate is typically maritime in terms of high precipitation, relatively modest sunshine hours and mild winters.

1060 by William the Conqueror, who successfully conquered England in 1066, is one of the largest medieval fortresses of Western Europe. It remained an essential feature of Norman strategy and policy. At Christmas 1182, a royal court celebration for Christmas in the aula of Caen Castle brought together Henry II and his sons, Richard the Lionheart and John Lackland , receiving more than a thousand knights. Caen Castle, along with all of Normandy, was handed over to the French Crown in 1204. The castle saw several engagements during the Hundred Years' War (1346, 1417, 1450) and was in use as a barracks as late as the Second World War. Bullet holes are visible on the walls of the castle where members of the French Resistance were shot during the Second World War. Today, the castle serves as a museum that houses the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen (Museum of Fine Arts of Caen) and Musée de Normandie (Museum of Normandy) along with many periodical exhibitions about arts and history.
