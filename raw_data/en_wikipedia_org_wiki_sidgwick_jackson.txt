Formerly it was an independent publisher; as such, it was founded in Britain in 1908 by Frank Sidgwick (1879–1939) as chairman of directors [ 2 ] and Robert Cameron Jackson (1882–1917) as company secretary.

It was best known as a publisher of literary fiction and some academic non-fiction.

Pan Macmillan acquired the company from Trusthouse Forte in the mid-1980s. It was dissolved in 2015.

[ 5 ] The managing director from 1968 to 1995 was William Armstrong; the company and Armstrong were said to have encouraged individuality and entrepreneurship among staff. Armstrong was also the father of the singer Dido .
