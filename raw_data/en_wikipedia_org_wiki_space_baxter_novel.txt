Cover to the US edition

_**Manifold: Space**_ is a science fiction book by British author [Stephen Baxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baxter_(author) "Stephen Baxter (author)"), first published in the United Kingdom in 2000, then released in the United States in 2001. It is the second book of the _[Manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold\_Trilogy "Manifold Trilogy")_ series and examines another possible solution to the [Fermi paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox "Fermi paradox"). Although it is in no sense a sequel to the first book it contains a number of the same characters, notably protagonist Reid Malenfant, and similar artefacts. The Manifold series contains four books, _[Manifold: Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold:\_Time "Manifold: Time")_, _Manifold: Space_, _[Manifold: Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold:\_Origin "Manifold: Origin")_, and _[Phase Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase\_Space\_(book) "Phase Space (book)")_.

[Alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life "Extraterrestrial life") activity is discovered in a [Kirkwood gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_gap "Kirkwood gap"); the aliens are identified as [self-replicating machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine "Self-replicating machine") ([von Neumann probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_probe "Von Neumann probe")). Their activity is potentially an immense threat, as Malenfant notes in an earlier speech: "A target system, we assume, is uninhabited. We can therefore program for massive and destructive exploitation of the system's resources, without restraint, by the [probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_probe "Von Neumann probe"). Such resources are useless for any other purpose, and are therefore economically free to us. And so we colonize, and build."

The [self-replicating spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft "Self-replicating spacecraft") are named _Gaijin_ (Japanese for "foreigner"), after their discovery by a Japanese observer on the Moon. Malenfant travels in a prototype fusion engine to the Kirkwood Gap and discovers an interstellar teleportation device. He travels around the galaxy to uncover information about the Fermi paradox (see below). At the same time, the story also follows the efforts of Humans on Earth and the eventual draining of the Earth's resources, making a move off-world necessary. At the same time a small group of humans use [anti-aging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aging "Anti-aging") techniques and an alien form of interstellar [teleportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation "Teleportation")[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(Baxter_novel)#cite_note-1) to "parachute" in on the changing solar system over many centuries.

Eventually, it is revealed that in this version of the [Fermi paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox "Fermi paradox"), [sentient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience "Sentience") life is endemic throughout the universe; Humanity simply had not noticed it earlier because the universe destroys any race before it becomes advanced enough to develop a [Type IV civilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale "Kardashev scale"). The story ends with Malenfant helping the Gaijin build a shield to prevent a [pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar "Pulsar") from sterilising a large part of the galaxy. Although this project will not be completed before another predicted pulsar event wipes out all extant species, it is hoped to give the sentient aliens who develop from the aftermath of the coming extinction a better chance at long-term survival.

*   Reid Malenfant– The protagonist in all four Manifold Books.
*   Madeleine Meacher– Other main character, former [pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator "Aviator") of a futuristic space plane and arms smuggler.
*   Nemoto– Lunar Japanese woman who mysteriously lives for many centuries, guiding humanity against the 'alien threat'
*   Dorothy Chaum– Catholic priest assigned by the pope to talk with the Gaijin at their first human contact on Earth.
*   Cassiopeia– Malenfant's Gaijin companion in his explorations

[Publishers Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishers_Weekly "Publishers Weekly") was positive in their review saying that "the novel covers far more territory, both in time and distance, than any one person could ever absorb is both a strength and a weakness; suspense is difficult to maintain over the course of centuries. While a large cast of characters helps generate this unwieldy scenario, only their scientific motivations are explored. Science itself is very clearly the star player on this stage. Nonetheless, this focus allows for an exceptionally intricate and original view of the future that both scientists and lay enthusiasts will enjoy."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(Baxter_novel)#cite_note-Publishers_Weekly-2) Jackie Cassada in her review for the [Library Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Journal "Library Journal") said that Baxter "balances the individual stories of his human protagonists against the panoramic scale of his setting in a landmark work of cosmic speculation".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(Baxter_novel)#cite_note-Cassada-3)

_Manifold: Space_ was named by [Library Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Journal "Library Journal") as one of the best Science Fiction and Fantasy books of 2001.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(Baxter_novel)#cite_note-Library_Journal-4)
