[ 1 ] For example, according to the canons 692 and 693 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law , an indult is needed when members of the consecrated life want to be dispensed from their religious vows , or when priests and deacons voluntarily seek to return to the lay state (usually to marry).

[ 2 ] A recent indult was the one granted in 1984 by Pope John Paul II , Quattuor abhinc annos , which authorised the world's Catholic bishops to permit celebrations of the Tridentine Mass liturgy in their dioceses . This indult was superseded in 2007 by new legislation introduced by Pope Benedict XVI in the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum , and superseded again in 2021 by Traditionis custodes .
