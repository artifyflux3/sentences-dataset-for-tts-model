Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promisedâ€”created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 nowâ€”or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

**James Drewry Stewart**, [MSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritorious_Service_Cross "Meritorious Service Cross") (March 29, 1941â€“ December 3, 2014) was a Canadian mathematician, violinist, and professor emeritus of mathematics at [McMaster University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_University "McMaster University"). Stewart is best known for his series of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") textbooks used for high school, college, and university-level courses.

Stewart received his master of science at [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University") and his doctor of philosophy from the [University of Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto "University of Toronto") in 1967. He worked for two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_London "University of London"), where his research focused on [harmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis "Harmonic analysis") and [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis"). His books are standard textbooks in universities in many countries. One of his best-known textbooks is _Calculus: Early Transcendentals_ (1995),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(mathematician)#cite_note-1) a set of textbooks which is accompanied by a [website](http://stewartcalculus.com/) for students.

Stewart was also a violinist and a former member of the [Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Philharmonic_Orchestra "Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(mathematician)#cite_note-xtra-2)

From 2003 to 2009[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(mathematician)#cite_note-3) a house designed by [Brigitte Shim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Shim "Brigitte Shim") and Howard Sutcliffe was constructed for Stewart in the Rosedale neighbourhood of Toronto at a cost of $32 million. He paid an additional $5.4 million for the existing house and lot which was torn down to make room for his new home.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(mathematician)#cite_note-4) Called [Integral House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_House "Integral House") (a reference to its curved walls, and their similarity to the mathematical [integral symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_symbol "Integral symbol")), the house includes a concert hall that seats 150. Stewart has said, "My books and my house are my twin legacies. If I hadn't commissioned the house I'm not sure what I would have spent the money on." [Glenn Lowry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Lowry "Glenn Lowry"), director of the [Museum of Modern Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art "Museum of Modern Art"), called the house "one of the most important private houses built in North America in a long time."[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(mathematician)#cite_note-5)

------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Stewart_(mathematician)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Personal life and political activism")]

Stewart was gay and involved in [LGBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT "LGBT") activism. According to [Joseph Clement](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Clement_(filmmaker)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Joseph Clement (filmmaker) (page does not exist)"), a documentary filmmaker who is working on a film about Stewart and Integral House, Stewart brought gay rights activist [George Hislop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hislop "George Hislop") to speak at [McMaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_University "McMaster University") in the early 1970s, when the LGBT liberation movement was in its infancy, and was involved in protests and demonstrations.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(mathematician)#cite_note-xtra-2)

In the summer of 2013, Stewart was diagnosed with [multiple myeloma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma "Multiple myeloma"), a blood cancer.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(mathematician)#cite_note-6) He died on December 3, 2014, aged 73.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(mathematician)#cite_note-7)

In 2015, he was posthumously awarded the [Meritorious Service Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritorious_Service_Cross "Meritorious Service Cross").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(mathematician)#cite_note-8)
