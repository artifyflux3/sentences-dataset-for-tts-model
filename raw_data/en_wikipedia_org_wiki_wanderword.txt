As such, Wanderwörter are a curiosity in historical linguistics and sociolinguistics within a wider study of language contact .

[ 1 ] At a sufficient time depth, it can be very difficult to establish in which language or language family a Wanderwort originated and into which it was borrowed.

Tea , with its Eurasian continental variant chai (both have entered English), is an example [ 1 ] whose spread occurred relatively late in human history and is therefore fairly well understood: tea is from Hokkien 茶 tê , specifically Amoy dialect , from the Fujianese port of Xiamen , hence it is the maritime variant, while 茶 chá (whence chai ) [ 4 ] is used in Cantonese and Mandarin .

Farang , a term derived from the ethnonym Frank through Andalusian Arabic , refers to foreigners (typically white and European ones). From the above two languages, the word has been loaned into many languages spoken on or near the Indian Ocean, including Hindi , Thai , and Amharic , among others. It also existed in Russian in the form " фрязин " with the same meaning.

The words for ' horse ' across many Eurasian languages seem to be related such as Mongolian морь ( mor ), Manchu ᠮᠣᡵᡳᠨ ( morin ), Korean 말 ( mal ), Japanese 馬 ( uma ), and Thai ม้า ( máː ), as well as Sino-Tibetan languages like Mandarin 馬 ( mǎ ). It is present in several Celtic and Germanic languages , whence Irish marc and English mare .
