Binary star systems Natural satellites Neutron star systems Red dwarf systems K-type main-sequence star systems Yellow dwarf systems F-type main-sequence star systems v t e The NIROSETI ( Near-InfraRed Optical Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ) is an astronomical program to search for artificial signals in the optical ( visible ) and near infrared (NIR) wavebands of the electromagnetic spectrum . It is the first dedicated near-infrared SETI experiment.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The instrument was created by a collaboration of scientists from the University of California, San Diego , Berkeley SETI Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley , University of Toronto , and the SETI Institute . It uses the Anna Nickel 1-m telescope at the Lick Observatory , situated on the summit of Mount Hamilton, east of San Jose, California, USA.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The instrument was commissioned (saw its first light ) on 15 March 2015 and has been operated for more than 150 nights, and is still operational today.

Overview [ edit ] Lick Observatory in California The NIROSETI project is designed to detect infrared pulses. Near-infrared offers a possible way for signal transmission since there is a decrease in both interstellar extinction and Galactic background compared to optical wavelengths.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The near-infrared bands remain largely unexplored because instruments capable of capturing short pulses of infrared light have only recently become available.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The NIROSETI instrument makes use of the 1-meter optical Nickel telescope located at the Lick Observatory in California to search for near-infrared ( laser ) transmissions from extraterrestrial communication or technosignatures . This project was funded by the Bill and Susan Bloomfield Foundation and is based upon a predecessor called Lick Optical SETI instrument, conducted between 2001 and 2006.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Shelley Wright leads the team that built and operates the NIROSETI program.

[ 7 ] The NIROSETI instrument employs a new generation of near-infrared (900 to 1700 nm) detectors, cooled at -25 °C, that have a high speed response (>1 GHz) and gain comparable to photomultiplier tubes, while also producing very low noise, [ 2 ] [ 5 ] and significantly reducing false positives.

[ 4 ] Its field-of-view is 2.5"x2.5" each, [ 8 ] and focuses
on detecting short (nanosecond) pulsed laser emissions. The NIROSETI instrument is also being used to study variability of very short natural near-infrared transient stars.

[ 2 ] [ 6 ] Targets [ edit ] The NIROSETI survey has been designed for observing several thousand objects over a few years, and commenced full operations on 28 January 2016. During a clear night of observations, about 20 to 30 objects are observed.

[ 4 ] Because infrared light penetrates farther through gas and dust than visible light, this search will extend to stars thousands of light-years away.

[ 6 ] The initial target sample is mostly main-sequence and giant stars located within 50 parsecs from Earth, drawn from the Breakthrough Listen program target list.

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The sample of targets also includes 82 galaxies for being the nearest representatives of the five major morphological classes of galaxies (20 spirals , 36 ellipticals , 15 dwarf spheroidals , 9 irregulars , and 2 lenticular galaxies), [ 4 ] as well as stars that triggered alarms on other targeted SETI surveys .

[ 4 ] A significant drawback is that the extraterrestrial laser signals would need to be transmitted in the direction of the Solar System in order to be detected.
