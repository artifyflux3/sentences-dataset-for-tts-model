The outgroup members can be anyone who possesses characteristics that are different from one's own, such as people of different races , religions , cultures , etc. It is a framework for understanding effective intergroup leadership and is conceptualized as a measurable state of mind with tangible consequences.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Allophilia scale The allophilia scale measures affection, comfort, engagement, enthusiasm, kinship.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] It has been adapted and validated to other languages such as Italian and Spanish, also to various settings, such as to measure positive attitude toward people with dementia, younger and older adults.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Allophilia predicts positive relationships with outgroup members. For instance, a study in Spain shows that students having higher allophilia had lower social distance toward people with obesity.

[ 10 ] Besides, positive experience with outgroup members may increase allophilia, as it is shown in a longitudinal study of a cook's tour in Vietnam. In that study, the participants, who were Americans, reported positive feelings toward Vietnamese mirroring Allophilia facets in nearly 10 years after the event.

[ 11 ] In one study, symhedonia (experiencing empathic joy) has been shown to be more closely associated with allophilia, while sympathy (experiencing empathic sorrow) has been shown to be more strongly associated with prejudice.

[ 12 ] Allophilia enhancement can serve as complement to prejudice reduction.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Terminology [ edit ] The term allophilia was coined by Harvard professor Todd Pittinsky in 2006, after he was unable to find an antonym for prejudice in any dictionary.

[ 14 ] [ disputed – discuss ] The term derived from Greek words meaning "liking or love of the other".

[ 15 ] Prejudice and positive intergroup relations [ edit ] The typical remedy for prejudice is to bring conflicting groups into a state of tolerance. However, tolerance is not the logical antithesis of prejudice, but rather is the midpoint between negative feelings and positive feelings toward others.

[ 16 ] See also [ edit ] Allport's Scale Malinchism Oikophobia Outgroup favoritism Paradox of tolerance Reverse discrimination Self-hatred Xenophilia References [ edit ] ^ Todd Pittinsky.
