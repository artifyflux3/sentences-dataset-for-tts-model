This state is followed by karyogamy , where the two nuclei fuse and then undergo meiosis to produce spores.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The dikaryotic state that comes after plasmogamy will often persist for many generations before the fungi undergoes karyogamy. In lower fungi however, plasmogamy is usually immediately followed by karyogamy.

[ 1 ] A comparative genomic study indicated the presence of the machinery for plasmogamy, karyogamy and meiosis in the Amoebozoa .
