Longitude lines are perpendicular to, and latitude lines parallel to, the Equator.

A **geographic coordinate system** (**GCS**) is a [spherical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system "Spherical coordinate system") or [geodetic coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_coordinates "Geodetic coordinates") system for measuring and communicating [positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(geometry) "Position (geometry)") directly on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") as [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") and [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-chang2016-1) It is the simplest, oldest, and most widely used type of the various [spatial reference systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_systems "Spatial reference systems") that are in use, and forms the basis for most others. Although latitude and longitude form a coordinate [tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") like a [cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"), geographic coordinate systems are not cartesian because the measurements are angles and are not on a planar surface.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-DiBiase-2)

A full GCS specification, such as those listed in the [EPSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPSG_Geodetic_Parameter_Dataset "EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset") and ISO 19111 standards, also includes a choice of [geodetic datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum "Geodetic datum") (including an [Earth ellipsoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid "Earth ellipsoid")), as different datums will yield different latitude and longitude values for the same location.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-epsg-3)

History
-------

The [invention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention "Invention") of a geographic coordinate system is generally credited to [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes "Eratosthenes") of [Cyrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrene,_Libya "Cyrene, Libya"), who composed his now-lost _[Geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography\_(Eratosthenes) "Geography (Eratosthenes)")_ at the [Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria "Library of Alexandria") in the 3rd century BC.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-4) A century later, [Hipparchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus#Geography "Hipparchus") of [Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaea "Nicaea") improved on this system by determining latitude from stellar measurements rather than solar altitude and determining longitude by timings of [lunar eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse "Lunar eclipse"), rather than [dead reckoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning "Dead reckoning"). In the 1st or 2nd century, [Marinus of Tyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinus_of_Tyre "Marinus of Tyre") compiled an extensive gazetteer and [mathematically plotted world map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection "Equirectangular projection") using coordinates measured east from a [prime meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian "Prime meridian") at the westernmost known land, designated the [Fortunate Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortunate_Isles "Fortunate Isles"), off the coast of western Africa around the [Canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands "Canary Islands") or [Cape Verde Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde "Cape Verde"), and measured north or south of the island of [Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes "Rhodes") off [Asia Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Minor "Asia Minor"). [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") credited him with the full adoption of longitude and latitude, rather than measuring latitude in terms of the length of the [midsummer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer "Midsummer") day.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-5)

Ptolemy's 2nd-century _[Geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography\_(Ptolemy) "Geography (Ptolemy)")_ used the same prime meridian but measured latitude from the [Equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator") instead. After their work was translated into [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") in the 9th century, [Al-Khwārizmī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi "Al-Khwarizmi")'s _[Book of the Description of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_the\_Description\_of\_the\_Earth "Book of the Description of the Earth")_ corrected Marinus' and Ptolemy's errors regarding the length of the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"),[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-6) causing [medieval Arabic cartography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_and_cartography_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world "Geography and cartography in the medieval Islamic world") to use a prime meridian around 10° east of Ptolemy's line. Mathematical cartography resumed in Europe following [Maximus Planudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximus_Planudes "Maximus Planudes")' recovery of Ptolemy's text a little before 1300; the text was translated into [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") at [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Florence "Republic of Florence") by [Jacopo d'Angelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacopo_d%27Angelo "Jacopo d'Angelo") around 1407.

In 1884, the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") hosted the [International Meridian Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Meridian_Conference "International Meridian Conference"), attended by representatives from twenty-five nations. Twenty-two of them agreed to adopt the longitude of the [Royal Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich "Royal Observatory, Greenwich") in [Greenwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich "Greenwich"), England as the zero-reference line. The [Dominican Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic "Dominican Republic") voted against the motion, while France and [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil") abstained.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-7) France adopted [Greenwich Mean Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time "Greenwich Mean Time") in place of local determinations by the [Paris Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Observatory "Paris Observatory") in 1911.

Latitude and longitude
----------------------

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Latitude_and_longitude_graticule_on_a_sphere.svg/330px-Latitude_and_longitude_graticule_on_a_sphere.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Latitude_and_longitude_graticule_on_a_sphere.svg)

The _latitude_[φ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi "Phi") of a point on Earth's surface is defined in one of three ways, depending on the type of coordinate system. In each case, the latitude is the angle formed by the plane of the equator and a line formed by the point on the surface and a second point on equatorial plane. What varies between the types of coordinate systems is how the point on the equatorial plane is determined:

*   In an astronomical coordinate system, the second point is found where the extension of the [plumb bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumb_bob "Plumb bob") vertical from the surface point intersects the equatorial plane.
*   In a geodetic coordinate system, the second point is found where the [normal vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_vector "Normal vector") from the surface of the ellipsoid at the surface point intersects the equatorial plane.
*   In a geocentric coordinate system, the second point is the center of Earth.

The path that joins all points of the same latitude traces a circle on the surface of Earth, as viewed from above the north or south pole, called [parallels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_latitude "Circle of latitude"), as they are parallel to the equator and to each other. The [north pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole "North Pole") is 90°N; the [south pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole "South Pole") is 90°S. The 0° parallel of latitude is defined to be the [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator"), the [fundamental plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_plane_(spherical_coordinates) "Fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)") of a geographic coordinate system. The equator divides the globe into [Northern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere "Northern Hemisphere") and [Southern Hemispheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere "Southern Hemisphere").

The _longitude_[λ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda "Lambda") of a point on Earth's surface is the angle east or west of a reference [meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography) "Meridian (geography)") to another meridian that passes through that point. All meridians are halves of great [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"), which converge at the North and South Poles. The meridian of the British [Royal Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich "Royal Observatory, Greenwich") in [Greenwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich "Greenwich"), in southeast London, England, is the international [prime meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian "Prime meridian"), although some organizations—such as the French [Institut national de l'information géographique et forestière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_national_de_l%27information_g%C3%A9ographique_et_foresti%C3%A8re "Institut national de l'information géographique et forestière")—continue to use other meridians for internal purposes. The [antipodal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes "Antipodes") meridian of Greenwich is both 180°W and 180°E. This is not to be conflated with the [International Date Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Date_Line "International Date Line"), which partly overlaps with the 180° meridian but diverges from it in several places for political and convenience reasons, including between far eastern Russia and the far western [Aleutian Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_Islands "Aleutian Islands").

The combination of these two components specifies the position of any location on the surface of Earth, without consideration of [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude "Altitude") or depth. The visual grid on a map formed by lines of latitude and longitude is known as a _[graticule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graticule\_(cartography) "Graticule (cartography)")_.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-8) The origin/zero point of this system is located in the [Gulf of Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Guinea "Gulf of Guinea") about 625 km (390 mi) south of [Tema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tema "Tema"), Ghana, a location often facetiously called [Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island "Null Island").

Geodetic datum
--------------

In order to use the theoretical definitions of latitude, longitude, and height to precisely measure actual locations on the physical earth, a _[geodetic datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic\_datum "Geodetic datum")_ must be used. A _horizonal datum_ is used to precisely measure latitude and longitude, while a _[vertical datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical\_datum "Vertical datum")_ is used to measure elevation or altitude. Both types of datum bind a mathematical model of the shape of the earth (usually a [reference ellipsoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ellipsoid "Reference ellipsoid") for a horizontal datum, and a more precise [geoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid "Geoid") for a vertical datum) to the earth. Traditionally, this binding was created by a network of [control points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_control_network "Geodetic control network"), surveyed locations at which monuments are installed, and were only accurate for a region of the surface of the Earth. Newer datums are based on a global network for satellite measurements ([GNSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation "Satellite navigation"), [VLBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry "Very-long-baseline interferometry"), [SLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_laser_ranging "Satellite laser ranging") and [DORIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DORIS_(satellite_system) "DORIS (satellite system)")).

This combination of a mathematical model and physical binding ensures that users of the same datum obtain identical coordinates for a given physical point. However, different datums typically produce different coordinates for the same location (sometimes deviating several hundred meters) not due to actual movement, but because the reference system itself is shifted. Because any [spatial reference system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system "Spatial reference system") or [map projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection "Map projection") is ultimately calculated from latitude and longitude, it is crucial that they clearly state the datum on which they are based. For example, a [UTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_transverse_mercator "Universal transverse mercator") coordinate based on a [WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS84 "WGS84") realisation will be different than a UTM coordinate based on [NAD27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAD27 "NAD27") for the same location. Transforming coordinates from one datum to another requires a [datum transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_conversion#Datum_transformations "Geographic coordinate conversion") method such as a [Helmert transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmert_transformation "Helmert transformation"), although in certain situations a simple [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") may be sufficient.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-Irish-9)

Datums may be global, meaning that they represent the whole Earth, or they may be regional,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-10) meaning that they represent an ellipsoid best-fit to only a portion of the Earth. Examples of global datums include the several realizations of [WGS 84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS_84 "WGS 84") (with the 2D datum ensemble EPSG:4326 with 2 meter accuracy as identifier)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-11)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-12) used for the [Global Positioning System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System "Global Positioning System"),[[note 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-13) and the several realizations of the [International Terrestrial Reference System and Frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Terrestrial_Reference_System_and_Frame "International Terrestrial Reference System and Frame") (such as ITRF2020 with subcentimeter accuracy), which takes into account [continental drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift "Continental drift") and [crustal deformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustal_deformation "Crustal deformation").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-Bolstad-14)

Datums with a regional fit of the ellipsoid that are chosen by a national cartographical organization include the [North American Datums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Datum "North American Datum"), the European [ED50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ED50 "ED50"), and the British [OSGB36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGB36 "OSGB36"). Given a location, the datum provides the latitude ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) and longitude ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \lambda }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a). In the United Kingdom there are three common latitude, longitude, and height systems in use. WGS 84 differs at Greenwich from the one used on published maps OSGB36 by approximately 112 m. ED50 differs from about 120 m to 180 m.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-OSGB-15)

Points on the Earth's surface move relative to each other due to continental plate motion, subsidence, and diurnal [Earth tidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_tide "Earth tide") movement caused by the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") and the Sun. This daily movement can be as much as a meter. Continental movement can be up to 10 cm a year, or 10 m in a century. A [weather system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_system "Weather system") high-pressure area can cause a sinking of 5 mm. [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia") is rising by 1 cm a year as a result of the melting of the ice sheets of the [last ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation "Quaternary glaciation"), but neighboring [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland "Scotland") is rising by only 0.2 cm. These changes are insignificant if a regional datum is used, but are statistically significant if a global datum is used.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-OSGB-15)

Length of a degree
------------------

On the [GRS 80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_Reference_System_1980 "Geodetic Reference System 1980") or [WGS 84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS84 "World Geodetic System") spheroid at [sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level "Sea level") at the Equator, one latitudinal second measures 30.715 [m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre"), one latitudinal minute is 1843 m and one latitudinal degree is 110.6 km. The circles of longitude, meridians, meet at the geographical poles, with the west–east width of a second naturally decreasing as latitude increases. On the [Equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator") at sea level, one longitudinal second measures 30.92 m, a longitudinal minute is 1855 m and a longitudinal degree is 111.3 km. At 30° a longitudinal second is 26.76 m, at Greenwich (51°28′38″N) 19.22 m, and at 60° it is 15.42 m.

On the WGS 84 spheroid, the length in meters of a degree of latitude at latitude ϕ (that is, the number of meters you would have to travel along a north–south line to move 1 degree in latitude, when at latitude ϕ), is about

![Image 6: {\displaystyle 111132.92-559.82\,\cos 2\phi +1.175\,\cos 4\phi -0.0023\,\cos 6\phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/957b5334ab3624061eceb4eeb53126f4765b6844)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-GISS-16)

The returned measure of meters per degree latitude varies continuously with latitude.

Similarly, the length in meters of a degree of longitude can be calculated as

![Image 7: {\displaystyle 111412.84\,\cos \phi -93.5\,\cos 3\phi +0.118\,\cos 5\phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f7af3bc707e66e2827831eb43c655fb5723d1a3)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#cite_note-GISS-16)

(Those coefficients can be improved, but as they stand the distance they give is correct within a centimeter.)

The formulae both return units of meters per degree.

An alternative method to estimate the length of a longitudinal degree at latitude ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) is to assume a spherical Earth (to get the width per minute and second, divide by 60 and 3600, respectively):

![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{180}}M_{r}\cos \phi \!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8842f42584619470faff49ae48ba58c005fb240a)

where [Earth's average meridional radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius#Meridional_Earth_radius "Earth radius")![Image 10: {\displaystyle \textstyle {M_{r}}\,\!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0353f63a61cadada5864e843480af0b5d4740e2e) is 6,367,449 m. Since the Earth is an [oblate spheroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid#Oblate_spheroids "Spheroid"), not spherical, that result can be off by several tenths of a percent; a better approximation of a longitudinal degree at latitude ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) is

![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{180}}a\cos \beta \,\!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8c8d34c8a49540046c2ec692c074a50a575be88a)

where Earth's equatorial radius ![Image 13: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) equals 6,378,137 m and ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \textstyle {\tan \beta ={\frac {b}{a}}\tan \phi }\,\!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e2cb7d107c87e5950b37be1418c8e811198bc6ab); for the GRS 80 and WGS 84 spheroids, ![Image 15: {\textstyle {\tfrac {b}{a}}=0.99664719}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/967f4bdafe42ac39f6a4e4d1cac0efa6b773f6ce). (![Image 16: {\displaystyle \textstyle {\beta }\,\!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7724761d56a88399f5ffac0403c05ef50bebad73) is known as the [reduced (or parametric) latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#Parametric_(or_reduced)_latitude "Latitude")). Aside from rounding, this is the exact distance along a parallel of latitude; getting the distance along the shortest route will be more work, but those two distances are always within 0.6 m of each other if the two points are one degree of longitude apart.

Longitudinal length equivalents at selected latitudes | Latitude | City | Degree | Minute | Second | 0.0001° |

Alternative encodings
---------------------

Like any series of multiple-digit numbers, latitude-longitude pairs can be challenging to communicate and remember. Therefore, alternative schemes have been developed for encoding GCS coordinates into alphanumeric strings or words:

*   the [Maidenhead Locator System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System "Maidenhead Locator System"), popular with radio operators.
*   the [World Geographic Reference System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geographic_Reference_System "World Geographic Reference System") (GEOREF), developed for global military operations, replaced by the current [Global Area Reference System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Area_Reference_System "Global Area Reference System") (GARS).
*   [Open Location Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Location_Code "Open Location Code") or "Plus Codes", developed by Google and released into the public domain.
*   [Geohash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash "Geohash"), a public domain system based on the Morton [Z-order curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve "Z-order curve").
*   [Mapcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapcode "Mapcode"), an open-source system originally developed at TomTom.
*   [What3words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What3words "What3words"), a proprietary system that encodes GCS coordinates as pseudorandom sets of words by dividing the coordinates into three numbers and looking up words in an indexed dictionary.

These are not distinct coordinate systems, only alternative methods for expressing latitude and longitude measurements.
