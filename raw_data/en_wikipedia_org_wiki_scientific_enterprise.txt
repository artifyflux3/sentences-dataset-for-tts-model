Examples of enterprising scientific organizations [ edit ] Each organization listed below has the ability to conduct scientific research on an extended basis, involving multiple researchers over an extended time. Generally, the research is funded not only for the science itself, but for some application which shows promise for the enterprise. But the researchers, if left to their own choices, will tend to follow their research interest, which is essential for the long-term health of their chosen field. Note that a successful scientific enterprise is not equivalent to a successful high-tech enterprise or to a successful business enterprise, but that they form an ecology, a food chain .

The Max Planck Institute , which supports fundamental research in the natural, life and social sciences, the arts and humanities The RAND Corporation , founded as a research corporation . Did groundbreaking work in the field of artificial intelligence The Jet Propulsion Laboratory , founded by Theodore von Kármán Bell Laboratories , renowned for the quality of its scientific work and for inventing the operating system Unix , and the programming languages C and C++ Xerox PARC , research organization which has also spawned innovations such as the graphical user interface , laser printing , and Ethernet SRI , where the computer mouse was invented, were explicitly founded with a research basis IBM Research , notable for inventing the relational database , hard disk drive , and floppy disk Hughes Research Laboratories , location of the invention of the first working laser The Howard Hughes Medical Institute , non-profit medical research organization See also [ edit ] Science of science policy (SoSP) References [ edit ] Gerald Holton, Einstein, History, and Other Passions [ full citation needed ] John Ziman, Reliable Knowledge [ full citation needed ] v t e Science and technology studies Economics Economics of science Economics of scientific knowledge History History and philosophy of science History of science and technology History of technology Languages of science Scientific language Philosophy Anthropocene Antipositivism Empiricism Fuzzy logic Neo-Luddism Philosophy of science Philosophy of social science Philosophy of technology Positivism Postpositivism Religion and science Scientism Social constructivism Social epistemology Transhumanism Sociology Actor–network theory Social construction of technology shaping of technology Sociology of knowledge scientific Sociology of scientific ignorance Sociology of the history of science Sociotechnology Strong programme Science studies Academic bias Antiscience Bibliometrics Boundary-work Consilience Criticism of science Demarcation problem Double hermeneutic Logology Mapping controversies Metascience Paradigm shift black swan events Pseudoscience Psychology of science Science citizen communication education normal Neo-colonial post-normal rhetoric wars Scientific community consensus controversy dissent enterprise literacy method misconduct priority skepticism Scientocracy Scientometrics Team science Traditional knowledge ecological Unity of science Women in science STEM Technology studies Co-production Cyborg anthropology Design studies Dematerialization Digital anthropology Digital media use and mental health Early adopter Engineering studies Financial technology Hype cycle Innovation diffusion disruptive linear model system user Leapfrogging Normalization process theory Media studies Reverse salient Skunkworks project Sociotechnical system Technical change Technocracy Technoscience feminist Technological change convergence determinism revolution transitions Technology and society criticism of dynamics theories of transfer Women in engineering Policy Academic freedom Digital divide Evidence-based policy Factor 10 Funding of science Horizon scanning Politicization of science Regulation of science Research ethics Right to science Science policy history of science of Technology assessment Technology policy Transition management Portals Science History of science Technology Category Associations Journals Scholars NewPP limit report
