For the concept in Mormonism, see Spirit body .

In Christianity, the apostle Paul introduced the concept of the spiritual body ( Koine Greek : sōma pneumatikos ) in the New Testament ( 1 Corinthians 15:44), describing the resurrected body as "spiritual" ( pneumatikos ) in contrast to the natural ( psychikos ) body: So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.

— 1 Corinthians 15:42-44, NIV Christian teaching traditionally interprets Paul as comparing a resurrected body with a mortal body, saying that it will be a different kind of body; a "spiritual body", meaning an immortal body , or incorruptible body (15:53—54).

[ 1 ] In the Catholic Church , traditionally the resurrected body is called the "glorified body", and retained four characteristics: incorruptibility, subtlety, impassibility, and agility. The bodies of the damned are also raised incorrupt, but not glorified or free from suffering.

The New Testament [...] makes a clear distinction between the 'natural' ( psychichos ) human life and the 'life in Christ,' a spiritual ( pneumatikos ) life that a person receives after conversion to Christ and baptism. [...] Rather, it will be a different kind of body : a 'spiritual body,' an immortal, incorruptible body (15:53-54).
