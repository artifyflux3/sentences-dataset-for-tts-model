[ 1 ] The term is often used as a criticism of market economies , emphasizing their chaotic and volatile nature in contrast to the stable nature of planned economies , as proposed by Marxists.

Examples [ edit ] The results of the unplanned "anarchy" of the capitalist market system can be seen in the crisis of overproduction , and underconsumption . One such example, according to the Socialist Party of Great Britain , was the 2008 financial crisis .
