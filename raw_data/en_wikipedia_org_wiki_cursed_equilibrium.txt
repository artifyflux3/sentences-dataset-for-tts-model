It is a generalization of the usual Bayesian Nash equilibrium , allowing for players to underestimate the connection between other players' equilibrium actions and their types – that is, the behavioral bias of neglecting the link between what others know and what others do. Intuitively, in a cursed equilibrium players "average away" the information regarding other players' types' mixed strategies.

The solution concept was first introduced by Erik Eyster and Matthew Rabin in 2005, [ 1 ] and has since become a canonical behavioral solution concept for Bayesian games in behavioral economics .

[ 2 ] Preliminaries [ edit ] Bayesian games [ edit ] Let I {\displaystyle I} be a finite set of players and for each i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} , define A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} their finite set of possible actions and T i {\displaystyle T_{i}} as their finite set of possible types; the sets A = ∏ ∏ i ∈ ∈ I A i {\displaystyle A=\prod _{i\in I}A_{i}} and T = ∏ ∏ i ∈ ∈ I T i {\displaystyle T=\prod _{i\in I}T_{i}} are the sets of joint action and type profiles, respectively. Each player has a utility function u i : A × × T → → R {\displaystyle u_{i}:A\times T\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } , and types are distributed according to a joint probability distribution p ∈ ∈ Δ Δ T {\displaystyle p\in \Delta T} . A finite Bayesian game consists of the data G = ( ( A i , T i , u i ) i ∈ ∈ I , p ) {\displaystyle G=((A_{i},T_{i},u_{i})_{i\in I},p)} .

Bayesian Nash equilibrium [ edit ] For each player i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} , a mixed strategy σ σ i : T i → → Δ Δ A i {\displaystyle \sigma _{i}:T_{i}\rightarrow \Delta A_{i}} specifies the probability σ σ i ( a i | t i ) {\displaystyle \sigma _{i}(a_{i}|t_{i})} of player i {\displaystyle i} playing action a i ∈ ∈ A i {\displaystyle a_{i}\in A_{i}} when their type is t i ∈ ∈ T i {\displaystyle t_{i}\in T_{i}} .

For notational convenience, we also define the projections A − − i = ∏ ∏ j ≠ ≠ i A j {\displaystyle A_{-i}=\prod _{j\neq i}A_{j}} and T − − i = ∏ ∏ j ≠ ≠ i T j {\displaystyle T_{-i}=\prod _{j\neq i}T_{j}} , and let σ σ − − i : T − − i → → ∏ ∏ j ≠ ≠ i Δ Δ A j {\displaystyle \sigma _{-i}:T_{-i}\rightarrow \prod _{j\neq i}\Delta A_{j}} be the joint mixed strategy of players j ≠ ≠ i {\displaystyle j\neq i} , where σ σ − − i ( a − − i | t − − i ) {\displaystyle \sigma _{-i}(a_{-i}|t_{-i})} gives the probability that players j ≠ ≠ i {\displaystyle j\neq i} play action profile a − − i {\displaystyle a_{-i}} when they are of type t − − i {\displaystyle t_{-i}} .

Definition: a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) for a finite Bayesian game G = ( ( A i , T i , u i ) i ∈ ∈ I , p ) {\displaystyle G=((A_{i},T_{i},u_{i})_{i\in I},p)} consists of a strategy profile σ σ = ( σ σ i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \sigma =(\sigma _{i})_{i\in I}} such that, for every i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} , every t i ∈ ∈ T i {\displaystyle t_{i}\in T_{i}} , and every action a i ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle a_{i}^{*}} played with positive probability σ σ i ( a i ∗ ∗ | t i ) > 0 {\displaystyle \sigma _{i}(a_{i}^{*}|t_{i})>0} , we have a i ∗ ∗ ∈ ∈ argmax a i ∈ ∈ A i ∑ ∑ t − − i ∈ ∈ T − − i p i ( t − − i | t i ) ∑ ∑ a − − i ∈ ∈ A − − i σ σ − − i ( a − − i | t − − i ) u i ( a i , a − − i , t i , t − − i ) {\displaystyle a_{i}^{*}\in {\underset {a_{i}\in A_{i}}{\operatorname {argmax} }}\sum _{t_{-i}\in T_{-i}}p_{i}(t_{-i}|t_{i})\sum _{a_{-i}\in A_{-i}}\sigma _{-i}(a_{-i}|t_{-i})u_{i}(a_{i},a_{-i},t_{i},t_{-i})} where p i ( t − − i | t i ) = p ( t i , t − − i ) ∑ ∑ t − − i ∈ ∈ T − − i p ( t i | t − − i ) p ( t − − i ) {\displaystyle p_{i}(t_{-i}|t_{i})={\frac {p(t_{i},t_{-i})}{\sum _{t_{-i}\in T_{-i}}p(t_{i}|t_{-i})p(t_{-i})}}} is player i {\displaystyle i} 's beliefs about other players types t − − i {\displaystyle t_{-i}} given his own type t i {\displaystyle t_{i}} .

Definition [ edit ] Average strategies [ edit ] First, we define the "average strategy of other players", averaged over their types. Formally, for each i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} and each t i ∈ ∈ T i {\displaystyle t_{i}\in T_{i}} , we define σ σ ¯ ¯ − − i : T i → → ∏ ∏ j ≠ ≠ i Δ Δ A j {\displaystyle {\overline {\sigma }}_{-i}:T_{i}\rightarrow \prod _{j\neq i}\Delta A_{j}} by putting σ σ ¯ ¯ − − i ( a − − i | t i ) = ∑ ∑ t − − i ∈ ∈ T i p i ( t − − i | t i ) σ σ − − i ( a − − i | t − − i ) {\displaystyle {\overline {\sigma }}_{-i}(a_{-i}|t_{i})=\sum _{t_{-i}\in T_{i}}p_{i}(t_{-i}|t_{i})\sigma _{-i}(a_{-i}|t_{-i})} Notice that σ σ ¯ ¯ − − i ( a − − i | t i ) {\displaystyle {\overline {\sigma }}_{-i}(a_{-i}|t_{i})} does not depend on t − − i {\displaystyle t_{-i}} . It gives the probability, viewed from the perspective of player i {\displaystyle i} when he is of type t i {\displaystyle t_{i}} , that the other players will play action profile a − − i {\displaystyle a_{-i}} when they follow the mixed strategy σ σ − − i {\displaystyle \sigma _{-i}} . More specifically, the information contained in σ σ ¯ ¯ − − i {\displaystyle {\overline {\sigma }}_{-i}} does not allow player i {\displaystyle i} to assess the direct relation between a − − i {\displaystyle a_{-i}} and t − − i {\displaystyle t_{-i}} given by σ σ − − i ( a − − i | t − − i ) {\displaystyle \sigma _{-i}(a_{-i}|t_{-i})} .

Cursed equilibrium [ edit ] Given a degree of mispercetion χ χ ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \chi \in [0,1]} , we define a χ χ {\displaystyle \chi } - cursed equilibrium for a finite Bayesian game G = ( ( A i , T i , u i ) i ∈ ∈ I , p ) {\displaystyle G=((A_{i},T_{i},u_{i})_{i\in I},p)} as a strategy profile σ σ = ( σ σ i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \sigma =(\sigma _{i})_{i\in I}} such that, for every i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} , every t i ∈ ∈ T i {\displaystyle t_{i}\in T_{i}} , we have a i ∗ ∗ ∈ ∈ argmax a i ∈ ∈ A i ∑ ∑ t − − i ∈ ∈ T − − i p i ( t − − i | t i ) ∑ ∑ a − − i ∈ ∈ A − − i [ χ χ σ σ ¯ ¯ − − i ( a − − i | t i ) + ( 1 − − χ χ ) σ σ − − i ( a − − i | t − − i ) ] u i ( a i , a − − i , t i , t − − i ) {\displaystyle a_{i}^{*}\in {\underset {a_{i}\in A_{i}}{\operatorname {argmax} }}\sum _{t_{-i}\in T_{-i}}p_{i}(t_{-i}|t_{i})\sum _{a_{-i}\in A_{-i}}\left[\chi {\overline {\sigma }}_{-i}(a_{-i}|t_{i})+(1-\chi )\sigma _{-i}(a_{-i}|t_{-i})\right]u_{i}(a_{i},a_{-i},t_{i},t_{-i})} for every action a i ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle a_{i}^{*}} played with positive probability σ σ i ( a i ∗ ∗ | t i ) > 0 {\displaystyle \sigma _{i}(a_{i}^{*}|t_{i})>0} .

For χ χ = 0 {\displaystyle \chi =0} , we have the usual BNE. For χ χ = 1 {\displaystyle \chi =1} , the equilibrium is referred to as a fully cursed equilibrium , and the players in it as fully cursed .

Applications [ edit ] Trade with asymmetric information [ edit ] In bilateral trade with two-sided asymmetric information, there are some scenarios where the BNE solution implies that no trade occurs, while there exist χ χ {\displaystyle \chi } -cursed equilibria where both parties choose to trade.

[ 1 ] Ambiguous political campaigns and cursed voters [ edit ] In an election model where candidates are policy-motivated, candidates who do not reveal their policy preferences would not be elected if voters are completely rational. In a BNE, voters would correctly infer that if a candidate is ambiguous about their policy position, then it's because such a position is unpopular. Therefore, unless a candidate has very extreme – unpopular – positions, they would announce their policy preferences.

If voters are cursed, however, they underestimate the connection between the non-announcement of policy position and the unpopularity of the policy. This leads to both moderate and extreme candidates concealing their policy preferences.
