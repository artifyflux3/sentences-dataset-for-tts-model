[ 1 ] In general, fractal curves are nowhere rectifiable curves — that is, they do not have finite length — and every subarc longer than a single point has infinite length .

[ 2 ] A famous example is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set .

Fractal curves in nature [ edit ] Fractal curves and fractal patterns are widespread, in nature , found in such places as broccoli , snowflakes , feet of geckos , frost crystals , and lightning bolts .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] See also Romanesco broccoli , dendrite crystal , trees, fractals , Hofstadter's butterfly , Lichtenberg figure ,  and self-organized criticality .

Dimensions of a fractal curve [ edit ] Most of us are used to mathematical curves having dimension one, but as a general rule, fractal curves have different dimensions, [ 7 ] also see fractal dimension and list of fractals by Hausdorff dimension .

Zooming in on the Mandelbrot set Relationships of fractal curves to other fields [ edit ] Starting in the 1950s Benoit Mandelbrot and others have studied self-similarity of fractal curves, and have applied theory of fractals to modelling natural phenomena . Self-similarity occurs, and analysis of these patterns has found fractal curves in such diverse fields as economics , fluid mechanics , geomorphology , human physiology and linguistics .

As examples, "landscapes" revealed by microscopic views of surfaces in connection with Brownian motion , vascular networks , and shapes of polymer molecules all relate to fractal curves.
