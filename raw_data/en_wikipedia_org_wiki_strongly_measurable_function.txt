Find sources: "Strongly measurable function" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( May 2024 ) Strong measurability has a number of different meanings, some of which are explained below.

Values in Banach spaces [ edit ] For a function f with values in a Banach space (or Fréchet space ), strong measurability usually means Bochner measurability .

However, if the values of f lie in the space L ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(X,Y)} of continuous linear operators from X to Y , then often strong measurability means that the operator f(x) is Bochner measurable for each fixed x in the domain of f , whereas the Bochner measurability of f is called uniform measurability (cf. " uniformly continuous " vs. " strongly continuous ").

Bounded operators [ edit ] A family of bounded linear operators combined with the direct integral is strongly measurable, when each of the individual operators is strongly measurable.

Semigroups [ edit ] A semigroup of linear operators can be strongly measurable yet not strongly continuous.

[ 1 ] It is uniformly measurable if and only if it is uniformly continuous, i.e., if and only if its generator is bounded.
