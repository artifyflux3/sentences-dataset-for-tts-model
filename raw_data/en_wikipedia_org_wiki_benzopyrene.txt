Structurally speaking, the colorless isomers of benzopyrene are pentacyclic hydrocarbons and are fusion products of pyrene and a phenylene group . Two isomeric species of benzopyrene are benzo[ a ]pyrene and the less common benzo[ e ]pyrene . They belong to the chemical class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .

Overview [ edit ] Related compounds include cyclopentapyrenes , dibenzopyrenes , indenopyrenes and naphthopyrenes . Benzopyrene is a component of pitch and occurs together with other related pentacyclic aromatic species such as picene , benzo fluoranthenes , and perylene .

[ 1 ] It is naturally emitted by forest fires and volcanic eruptions and can also be found in coal tar , cigarette smoke , wood smoke, and burnt foods such as coffee . Fumes that develop from fat dripping on blistering charcoal are rich in benzopyrene, which can condense on grilled goods.

[ 2 ] Benzopyrenes are harmful because they form carcinogenic and mutagenic metabolites (such as (+)-benzo[ a ]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide from benzo[ a ]pyrene) which intercalate into DNA, interfering with transcription .  They are considered pollutants and carcinogens. The mechanism of action of benzo[a]pyrene-related DNA modification has been investigated extensively and relates to the activity of cytochrome P450 subclass 1A1 ( CYP1A1 ).

[ 3 ] Seemingly, the high activity of CYP1A1 in the intestinal mucosa prevents major amounts of ingested benzo[a]pyrene from entering portal blood and systemic circulation.

[ 4 ] The intestinal (but not hepatic) detoxification mechanism seems to depend on receptors that recognize bacterial surface components ( TLR2 ).

[ 5 ] Evidence exists to link benzo[ a ]pyrene to the formation of lung cancer .

[ 6 ] In February 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including benzopyrene, in the universe . According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life . PAHs seem to have been formed several billion years after the Big Bang , are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets .
