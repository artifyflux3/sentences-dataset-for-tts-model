[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Early life Allah Rakha Rahman [ 13 ] was born as Dileep Kumar Rajagopala in Madras , Tamil Nadu , on 6 January 1967.

[ 14 ] His father, R. K. Shekhar from a Vellalar [ 15 ] [ 16 ] family, was a film score composer and conductor for Malayalam films . Rahman began studying piano at age four.

[ 14 ] He assisted his father in the studio, playing the keyboard.

After his father's death when Rahman was nine years old, the rental of his father's musical equipment provided his family's income.

[ 17 ] Raised by his mother, Kareema (born Kashturi), [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Rahman, who was studying in Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan had to work to support his family, which led to him to routinely miss classes and fail exams.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Rahman attended another school called MCN for a year, [ 22 ] and later joined the Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School , where he was admitted for his musical talent and formed a band with his high school classmates.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] However, after discussing it with his mother, he later dropped out of school to pursue a career as a full-time musician.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] Rahman was a keyboard player and arranger for bands such as Roots (with childhood friend and percussionist Sivamani , Suresh Peters and John Anthony, JoJo and Raja) [ 27 ] and founded the Chennai-based rock group Nemesis Avenue.

[ 28 ] He mastered the keyboard, piano, synthesizer, harmonium and guitar, and was particularly interested in the synthesizer because it was the "ideal combination of music and technology".

[ 29 ] Rahman began his early musical training under Master Dhanraj , [ 30 ] [ 31 ] and at age 11 began playing in the orchestra of a Malayalam composer (and close friend of his father) M. K. Arjunan .

According to his biography AR Rahman: The Spirit of Music by Nasreen Munni Kabir, a Hindu astrologer suggested the names "Abdul Rahman" and "Abdul Rahim," and Rahman instantly connected with the former.
