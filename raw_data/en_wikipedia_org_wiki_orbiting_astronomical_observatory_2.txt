[ 3 ] An Atlas-Centaur rocket launched it into a nearly circular 750-kilometre (470 mi) altitude Earth orbit.

[ 4 ] Data was collected in ultraviolet on many sources including comets, planets, and galaxies.

[ 3 ] [ 5 ] It had two major instrument sets facing in opposite directions; the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) and the Wisconsin Experiment Package (WEP).

[ 5 ] One discovery was large halos of hydrogen gas around comets, [ 5 ] and it also observed Nova Serpentis , which was a nova discovered in 1970.

[ 3 ] Celescope: Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory [ edit ] The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, also called Celescope, had four 12 inch (30.5 cm) Schwarzschild telescopes that fed into Uvicons.

[ 6 ] The Uvicon was an ultra-violet light detector based on the  Westinghouse Vidicon .

[ 7 ] Ultraviolet light was converted into electrons which were in turn converted to a voltage as those electrons hit the detection area of the tube.

[ 8 ] There has been a Uvicon in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution since 1973.

[ 7 ] Various filters, photocathodes , and electronics aided in collecting data in several ultraviolet light passbands .

[ 6 ] The detectors showed a gradual loss of sensitivity [ 9 ] and the experiment was turned off in April 1970.

[ 6 ] By the time it finished about 10 percent of the sky was observed [ 6 ] resulting in a catalog of 5,068 UV stars.

[ 9 ] Wisconsin Experiment Package [ edit ] The Wisconsin Experiment Package had seven different telescopes for ultraviolet observations.

[ 10 ] For example, there was a nebular photoelectric photometer fed by a 16-inch (40.64 cm) telescope with a six-position filter wheel [ 10 ] that unfortunately failed a few weeks after launch.

[ 9 ] Construction was supervised by Arthur Code of the University of Wisconsin-Madison .

[ 9 ] WEP observed over 1200 targets in ultraviolet light before the mission ended in early 1973.

[ 5 ] Discoveries [ edit ] In addition to the Celescope's catalog of UV stars, the WEP observed comet Tago-Sato-Kosaka and found it to be surrounded by a cloud of hydrogen, confirming that the comet was largely made up of water, and detected the 2175-angstrom bump , an increase in UV absorption at that wavelength that is still not fully explained.

[ 9 ] Spacecraft bus [ edit ] The observatory was built in the shape of an octagonal prism . It measured about 10 by 7 ft (3.0 by 2.1 m) and weighed 4,400 lb (2,000 kg).
