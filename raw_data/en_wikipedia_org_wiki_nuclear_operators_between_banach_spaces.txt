In Hilbert spaces such operators are usually called trace class operators and one can define such things as the trace . In Banach spaces this is no longer possible for general nuclear operators, it is however possible for 2 3 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2}{3}}} -nuclear operator via the Grothendieck trace theorem .

The general definition for Banach spaces was given by Grothendieck . This article presents both cases but concentrates on the general case of nuclear operators on Banach spaces.

Nuclear operators on Hilbert spaces [ edit ] Main article: trace class operator An operator L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} on a Hilbert space H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} L : H → → H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}:{\mathcal {H}}\to {\mathcal {H}}} is compact if it can be written in the form [ citation needed ] L = ∑ ∑ n = 1 N ρ ρ n ⟨ ⟨ f n , ⋅ ⋅ ⟩ ⟩ g n , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}=\sum _{n=1}^{N}\rho _{n}\langle f_{n},\cdot \rangle g_{n},} where 1 ≤ ≤ N ≤ ≤ ∞ ∞ , {\displaystyle 1\leq N\leq \infty ,} and { f 1 , … … , f N } {\displaystyle \{f_{1},\ldots ,f_{N}\}} and { g 1 , … … , g N } {\displaystyle \{g_{1},\ldots ,g_{N}\}} are (not necessarily complete) orthonormal sets. Here { ρ ρ 1 , … … , ρ ρ N } {\displaystyle \{\rho _{1},\ldots ,\rho _{N}\}} is a set of real numbers, the set of singular values of the operator, obeying ρ ρ n → → 0 {\displaystyle \rho _{n}\to 0} if N = ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle N=\infty .} The bracket ⟨ ⟨ ⋅ ⋅ , ⋅ ⋅ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle } is the scalar product on the Hilbert space; the sum on the right hand side must converge in norm.

An operator that is compact as defined above is said to be nuclear or trace-class if ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ | ρ ρ n | < ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }|\rho _{n}|<\infty .} Properties [ edit ] A nuclear operator on a Hilbert space has the important property that a trace operation may be defined.  Given an orthonormal basis { ψ ψ n } {\displaystyle \{\psi _{n}\}} for the Hilbert space, the trace is defined as Tr ⁡ ⁡ L = ∑ ∑ n ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ n , L ψ ψ n ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {Tr} {\mathcal {L}}=\sum _{n}\langle \psi _{n},{\mathcal {L}}\psi _{n}\rangle .} Obviously, the sum converges absolutely, and it can be proven that the result is independent of the basis [ citation needed ] . It can be shown that this trace is identical to the sum of the eigenvalues of L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} (counted with multiplicity).

Nuclear operators on Banach spaces [ edit ] Main article: Fredholm kernel The definition of trace-class operator was extended to Banach spaces by Alexander Grothendieck in 1955.

Let A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} be Banach spaces, and A ′ ′ {\displaystyle A^{\prime }} be the dual of A , {\displaystyle A,} that is, the set of all continuous or (equivalently) bounded linear functionals on A {\displaystyle A} with the usual norm. 
There is a canonical evaluation map A ′ ′ ⊗ ⊗ B → → Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( A , B ) {\displaystyle A^{\prime }\otimes B\to \operatorname {Hom} (A,B)} (from the projective tensor product of A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} to the Banach space of continuous linear maps from A {\displaystyle A} to B {\displaystyle B} ). 
It is determined by sending f ∈ ∈ A ′ ′ {\displaystyle f\in A^{\prime }} and b ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle b\in B} to the linear map a ↦ ↦ f ( a ) ⋅ ⋅ b .

{\displaystyle a\mapsto f(a)\cdot b.} An operator L ∈ ∈ Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( A , B ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\in \operatorname {Hom} (A,B)} is called nuclear if it is in the image of this evaluation map.

[ 1 ] q -nuclear operators [ edit ] An operator L : A → → B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}:A\to B} is said to be nuclear of order q {\displaystyle q} if there exist sequences of  vectors { g n } ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle \{g_{n}\}\in B} with ‖ ‖ g n ‖ ‖ ≤ ≤ 1 , {\displaystyle \Vert g_{n}\Vert \leq 1,} functionals { f n ∗ ∗ } ∈ ∈ A ′ ′ {\displaystyle \left\{f_{n}^{*}\right\}\in A^{\prime }} with ‖ ‖ f n ∗ ∗ ‖ ‖ ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle \Vert f_{n}^{*}\Vert \leq 1} and complex numbers { ρ ρ n } {\displaystyle \{\rho _{n}\}} with ∑ ∑ n | ρ ρ n | q < ∞ ∞ , {\displaystyle \sum _{n}|\rho _{n}|^{q}<\infty ,} such that the operator may be written as L = ∑ ∑ n ρ ρ n f n ∗ ∗ ( ⋅ ⋅ ) g n {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}=\sum _{n}\rho _{n}f_{n}^{*}(\cdot )g_{n}} with the sum converging in the operator norm.

Operators that are nuclear of order 1 are called nuclear operators : these are the ones for which the series ∑ ∑ ρ ρ n {\displaystyle \sum \rho _{n}} is absolutely convergent. 
Nuclear operators of order 2 are called Hilbert–Schmidt operators .

Relation to trace-class operators [ edit ] With additional steps, a trace may be defined for such operators when A = B .

{\displaystyle A=B.} Properties [ edit ] The trace and determinant can no longer be defined in general in Banach spaces. However they can be defined for the so-called 2 3 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2}{3}}} -nuclear operators via Grothendieck trace theorem .

Generalizations [ edit ] More generally, an operator from a locally convex topological vector space A {\displaystyle A} to a Banach space B {\displaystyle B} is called nuclear if it satisfies the condition above with all f n ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle f_{n}^{*}} bounded by 1 on some fixed neighborhood of 0.

An extension of the concept of nuclear maps to arbitrary monoidal categories is given by Stolz & Teichner (2012) . 
A monoidal category can be thought of as a category equipped with a suitable notion of a tensor product. 
An example of a monoidal category is the category of Banach spaces or alternatively the category of locally convex, complete, Hausdorff spaces; both equipped with the projective tensor product. 
A map f : A → → B {\displaystyle f:A\to B} in a monoidal category is called thick if it can be written as a composition A ≅ ≅ I ⊗ ⊗ A ⟶ ⟶ t ⊗ ⊗ id A B ⊗ ⊗ C ⊗ ⊗ A ⟶ ⟶ id B ⊗ ⊗ s B ⊗ ⊗ I ≅ ≅ B {\displaystyle A\cong I\otimes A{\stackrel {t\otimes \operatorname {id} _{A}}{\longrightarrow }}B\otimes C\otimes A{\stackrel {\operatorname {id} _{B}\otimes s}{\longrightarrow }}B\otimes I\cong B} for an appropriate object C {\displaystyle C} and maps t : I → → B ⊗ ⊗ C , s : C ⊗ ⊗ A → → I , {\displaystyle t:I\to B\otimes C,s:C\otimes A\to I,} where I {\displaystyle I} is the monoidal unit.

In the monoidal category of Banach spaces, equipped with the projective tensor product, a map is thick if and only if it is nuclear.

[ 2 ] Examples [ edit ] Suppose that f : H 1 → → H 2 {\displaystyle f:H_{1}\to H_{2}} and g : H 2 → → H 3 {\displaystyle g:H_{2}\to H_{3}} are Hilbert-Schmidt operators between Hilbert spaces. Then the composition g ∘ ∘ f : H 1 → → H 3 {\displaystyle g\circ f:H_{1}\to H_{3}} is a nuclear operator .
