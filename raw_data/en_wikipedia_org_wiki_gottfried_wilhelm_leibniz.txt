**Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** (or **Leibnitz**;[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-16) 1 July 1646 [[O.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates "Old Style and New Style dates") 21 June] – 14 November 1716) was a German [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath "Polymath") active as a [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician"), [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher"), [scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist "Scientist") and [diplomat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat "Diplomat") who is credited, alongside [Sir Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), with the creation of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") in addition to many other branches of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), such as binary arithmetic and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"). Leibniz has been called the "last universal genius" due to his vast expertise across fields, which became a rarity after his lifetime with the coming of the Industrial Revolution and the spread of specialized labor.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-17) He is a prominent figure in both the [history of philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_philosophy "History of philosophy") and the [history of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mathematics "History of mathematics"). He wrote works on [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology"), [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics"), [politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics "Politics"), [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law"), [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History "History"), [philology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology "Philology"), [games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games "Games"), [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music "Music"), and other studies. Leibniz also made major contributions to [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"), and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"), [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine"), [geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology"), [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science").

Leibniz contributed to the field of [library science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_science "Library science"), developing a cataloguing system (at the [Herzog August Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzog_August_Library "Herzog August Library") in [Wolfenbüttel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenb%C3%BCttel "Wolfenbüttel"), Germany) that came to serve as a model for many of Europe's largest libraries.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-18)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-19) His contributions to a wide range of subjects were scattered in various [learned journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_journal "Learned journal"), in tens of thousands of letters and in unpublished manuscripts. He wrote in several languages, primarily in Latin, French and German.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-20)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-22)

As a philosopher, he was a leading representative of 17th-century [rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism "Rationalism") and [idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism "Idealism"). As a mathematician, his major achievement was the development of differential and integral calculus, [independently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Newton_calculus_controversy "Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy") of Newton's contemporaneous developments.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-23)[Leibniz's notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%27s_notation "Leibniz's notation") has been favored as the conventional and more exact expression of calculus.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-24)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-25)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-26) In addition to his work on calculus, he is credited with devising the modern [binary number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number "Binary number") system, which is the basis of modern communications and digital computing;[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-27) however, the English astronomer [Thomas Harriot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Harriot "Thomas Harriot") had devised the same system decades before.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-28) He envisioned the field of [combinatorial topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_topology "Combinatorial topology") as early as 1679,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-:2-29) and helped initiate the field of [fractional calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_calculus "Fractional calculus").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-:12-30)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Derivative-31)

In the 20th century, Leibniz's notions of the [law of continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_continuity "Law of continuity") and the [transcendental law of homogeneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_law_of_homogeneity "Transcendental law of homogeneity") found a consistent mathematical formulation by means of [non-standard analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_analysis "Non-standard analysis"). He was also a pioneer in the field of [mechanical calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_calculator "Mechanical calculator"). While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to [Pascal's calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_calculator "Pascal's calculator"), he was the first to describe a [pinwheel calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwheel_calculator "Pinwheel calculator") in 1685[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-32) and invented the [Leibniz wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_wheel "Leibniz wheel"), later used in the [arithmometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmometer "Arithmometer"), the first mass-produced mechanical calculator.

In [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") and [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology"), Leibniz is most noted for his [optimism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_optimism "Philosophical optimism"), i.e. his conclusion that our world is, in a qualified sense, the [best possible world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_all_possible_worlds "Best of all possible worlds") that [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God "God") could have [created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatio_ex_nihilo "Creatio ex nihilo"), a view sometimes lampooned by other thinkers, such as [Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire "Voltaire") in his [satirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire "Satire")[novella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novella "Novella")_[Candide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide "Candide")_. Leibniz, along with [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") and [Baruch Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza "Baruch Spinoza"), was one of the three influential early modern [rationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism "Rationalism"). His philosophy also assimilates elements of the [scholastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism "Scholasticism") tradition, notably the assumption that some substantive knowledge of reality can be achieved by reasoning from first principles or prior definitions. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and still influences contemporary [analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy "Analytic philosophy"), such as its adopted use of the term "[possible world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world "Possible world")" to define [modal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modality_(natural_language) "Modality (natural language)") notions.

Gottfried Leibniz was born on 1 July [[OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style "Old Style"): 21 June] 1646, in [Leipzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig "Leipzig"), Saxony, to [Friedrich Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Leibniz "Friedrich Leibniz") (1597–1652) and Catharina Schmuck (1621–1664).[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-33) He was baptized two days later at [St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Nicholas_Church,_Leipzig "St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig"); his godfather was the [Lutheran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheran "Lutheran") theologian [Martin Geier](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Geier&action=edit&redlink=1 "Martin Geier (page does not exist)")[[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Geier "de:Martin Geier")].[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-34) His father died when he was six years old, and Leibniz was raised by his mother.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-35)

Leibniz's father had been a Professor of Moral Philosophy at the [University of Leipzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leipzig "University of Leipzig"), where he also served as dean of philosophy. The boy inherited his father's personal library. He was given free access to it from the age of seven, shortly after his father's death. While Leibniz's schoolwork was largely confined to the study of a small [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(basic_principle) "Canon (basic principle)") of authorities, his father's library enabled him to study a wide variety of advanced philosophical and theological works—ones that he would not have otherwise been able to read until his college years.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-36) Access to his father's library, largely written in [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin"), also led to his proficiency in the Latin language, which he achieved by the age of 12. At the age of 13 he composed 300 [hexameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexameters "Hexameters") of [Latin verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_poetry "Latin poetry") in a single morning for a special event at school.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-37)

In April 1661 he enrolled in his father's former university at age 14.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-38)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Arthur_p._16-1)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-39) There he was guided, among others, by [Jakob Thomasius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Thomasius "Jakob Thomasius"), previously a student of Friedrich. Leibniz completed his [bachelor's degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree "Bachelor's degree") in Philosophy in December 1662. He defended his _Disputatio Metaphysical de Principio Individual_ (_Metaphysical Disputation on the Principle of Individuation_),[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Arthur_p._x-40) which addressed the [principle of individuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_individuation "Principle of individuation"), on 9 June 1663 [[O.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates "Old Style and New Style dates") 30 May], presenting an early version of [monadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology "Monadology") substance theory. Leibniz earned his [master's degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree "Master's degree") in Philosophy on 7 February 1664. In December 1664 he published and defended a [dissertation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissertation "Dissertation")_Specimen Quaestionum Philosophicarum ex Jure collectarum_ (_An Essay of Collected Philosophical Problems of Right_),[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Arthur_p._x-40) arguing for both a theoretical and a pedagogical relationship between philosophy and law. After one year of legal studies, he was awarded his bachelor's degree in Law on 28 September 1665.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-41) His dissertation was titled _De conditionibus_ (_On Conditions_).[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Arthur_p._x-40)

In early 1666, at age 19, Leibniz wrote his first book, _[De Arte Combinatoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Arte\_Combinatoria "De Arte Combinatoria")_ (_On the Combinatorial Art_), the first part of which was also his [habilitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation "Habilitation") thesis in Philosophy, which he defended in March 1666.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Arthur_p._x-40)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-42)_De Arte Combinatoria_ was inspired by [Ramon Llull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull "Ramon Llull")'s _[Ars Magna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars\_Magna\_(Ramon\_Llull) "Ars Magna (Ramon Llull)")_ and contained a [proof of the existence of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_the_existence_of_God "Proof of the existence of God"), cast in geometrical form, and based on the [argument from motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_motion "Argument from motion").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

His next goal was to earn his license and Doctorate in Law, which normally required three years of study. In 1666, the University of Leipzig turned down Leibniz's doctoral application and refused to grant him a Doctorate in Law, most likely due to his relative youth.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-43)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-44) Leibniz subsequently left Leipzig.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-45)

Leibniz then enrolled in the [University of Altdorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Altdorf "University of Altdorf") and quickly submitted a thesis, which he had probably been working on earlier in Leipzig.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-46) The title of his thesis was _Disputatio Inauguralis de Casibus Perplexis in Jure_ (_Inaugural Disputation on Ambiguous Legal Cases_).[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Arthur_p._x-40) Leibniz earned his license to practice law and his Doctorate in Law in November 1666. He next declined the offer of an academic appointment at Altdorf, saying that "my thoughts were turned in an entirely different direction".[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-47)

As an adult, Leibniz often introduced himself as "Gottfried [von](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von "Von") Leibniz". Many posthumously published editions of his writings presented his name on the title page as "[Freiherr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiherr "Freiherr") G. W. von Leibniz." However, no document has ever been found from any contemporary government that stated his appointment to any form of [nobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility "Nobility").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-48)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz_c1700.jpg/250px-Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz_c1700.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz_c1700.jpg)

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

Leibniz's first position was as a salaried secretary to an [alchemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy") society in [Nuremberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg "Nuremberg").[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-49) He knew fairly little about the subject at that time but presented himself as deeply learned. He soon met [Johann Christian von Boyneburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Christian_von_Boyneburg "Johann Christian von Boyneburg") (1622–1672), the dismissed chief minister of the [Elector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-elector "Prince-elector") of [Mainz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainz "Mainz"), [Johann Philipp von Schönborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Philipp_von_Sch%C3%B6nborn "Johann Philipp von Schönborn").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-50) Von Boyneburg hired Leibniz as an assistant, and shortly thereafter reconciled with the Elector and introduced Leibniz to him. Leibniz then dedicated an essay on law to the Elector in the hope of obtaining employment. The stratagem worked; the Elector asked Leibniz to assist with the redrafting of the legal code for the Electorate.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-51) In 1669, Leibniz was appointed assessor in the Court of Appeal. Although von Boyneburg died late in 1672, Leibniz remained under the employment of his widow until she dismissed him in 1674.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-52)

Von Boyneburg did much to promote Leibniz's reputation, and the latter's memoranda and letters began to attract favorable notice. After Leibniz's service to the Elector there soon followed a diplomatic role. He published an essay, under the pseudonym of a fictitious Polish nobleman, arguing (unsuccessfully) for the German candidate for the Polish crown. The main force in European geopolitics during Leibniz's adult life was the ambition of [Louis XIV of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France "Louis XIV of France"), backed by French military and economic might. Meanwhile, the [Thirty Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War "Thirty Years' War") had left [German-speaking Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language_in_Europe "German language in Europe") exhausted, fragmented, and economically backward. Leibniz proposed to protect German-speaking Europe by distracting Louis as follows: France would be invited to take [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt") as a stepping stone towards an eventual conquest of the [Dutch East Indies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies "Dutch East Indies"). In return, France would agree to leave Germany and the Netherlands undisturbed. This plan obtained the Elector's cautious support. In 1672, the French government invited Leibniz to Paris for discussion,[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-53) but the plan was soon overtaken by the outbreak of the [Franco-Dutch War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Dutch_War "Franco-Dutch War") and became irrelevant. Napoleon's [failed invasion of Egypt in 1798](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_campaign_in_Egypt_and_Syria "French campaign in Egypt and Syria") can be seen as an unwitting, late implementation of Leibniz's plan, after the Eastern hemisphere colonial supremacy in Europe had already passed from the Dutch to the British.

Thus Leibniz went to Paris in 1672. Soon after arriving, he met Dutch physicist and mathematician [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") and realised that his own knowledge of mathematics and physics was patchy. With Huygens as his mentor, he began a program of [self-study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-study "Self-study") that soon pushed him to making major contributions to both subjects, including discovering his version of the differential and integral [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"). He met [Nicolas Malebranche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Malebranche "Nicolas Malebranche") and [Antoine Arnauld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Arnauld "Antoine Arnauld"), the leading French philosophers of the day, and studied the writings of [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes") and [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal "Blaise Pascal"), unpublished as well as published.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-54) He befriended a German mathematician, [Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenfried_Walther_von_Tschirnhaus "Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus"); they corresponded for the rest of their lives.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Stepped reckoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepped_reckoner "Stepped reckoner")

When it became clear that France would not implement its part of Leibniz's Egyptian plan, the Elector sent his nephew, escorted by Leibniz, on a related mission to the English government in London, early in 1673.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-55) There Leibniz came into acquaintance of [Henry Oldenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Oldenburg "Henry Oldenburg") and [John Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Collins_(mathematician) "John Collins (mathematician)"). He met with the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society") where he demonstrated a calculating machine that he had designed and had been building since 1670. The machine was able to execute all four basic operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing), and the society quickly made him an external member.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The mission ended abruptly when news of the Elector's death (12 February 1673) reached them. Leibniz promptly returned to Paris and not, as had been planned, to Mainz.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-56) The sudden deaths of his two patrons in the same winter meant that Leibniz had to find a new basis for his career.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In this regard, a 1669 invitation from Duke [John Frederick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frederick,_Duke_of_Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg "John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg") of [Brunswick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg "Brunswick-Lüneburg") to visit Hanover proved to have been fateful. Leibniz had declined the invitation, but had begun corresponding with the duke in 1671. In 1673, the duke offered Leibniz the post of counsellor. Leibniz very reluctantly accepted the position two years later, only after it became clear that no employment was forthcoming in Paris, whose intellectual stimulation he relished, or with the [Habsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg "Habsburg") imperial court.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-CRC_Press-57)

In 1675 he tried to get admitted to the [French Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences "French Academy of Sciences") as a foreign honorary member, but it was considered that there were already enough foreigners there and so no invitation came. He left Paris in October 1676.

### House of Hanover, 1676–1716

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: House of Hanover, 1676–1716")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Leibniz_Hannover.jpg/250px-Leibniz_Hannover.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leibniz_Hannover.jpg)

Portrait of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Public Library of Hanover, 1703

Leibniz managed to delay his arrival in Hanover until the end of 1676 after making one more short journey to London, where Newton accused him of having seen his unpublished work on calculus in advance.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-58) This was alleged to be evidence supporting the accusation, made decades later, that he had stolen calculus from Newton. On the journey from London to Hanover, Leibniz stopped in [The Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague "The Hague") where he met [van Leeuwenhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Leeuwenhoek "Van Leeuwenhoek"), the discoverer of microorganisms. He also spent several days in intense discussion with [Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza "Baruch Spinoza"), who had just completed, but had not published, his masterwork, the _[Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics\_(Spinoza) "Ethics (Spinoza)")_.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-59) Spinoza died very shortly after Leibniz's visit.

In 1677, he was promoted, at his request, to Privy Counselor of Justice, a post he held for the rest of his life. Leibniz served three consecutive rulers of the House of Brunswick as historian, political adviser, and most consequentially, as librarian of the [ducal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke "Duke") library. He thenceforth employed his pen on all the various political, historical, and [theological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological "Theological") matters involving the House of Brunswick; the resulting documents form a valuable part of the historical record for the period.

Leibniz began promoting a project to use windmills to improve the mining operations in the Harz Mountains. This project did little to improve mining operations and was shut down by Duke Ernst August in 1685.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-CRC_Press-57)

Among the few people in north Germany to accept Leibniz were the Electress [Sophia of Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_of_Hanover "Sophia of Hanover") (1630–1714), her daughter [Sophia Charlotte of Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Charlotte_of_Hanover "Sophia Charlotte of Hanover") (1668–1705), the Queen of Prussia and his avowed disciple, and [Caroline of Ansbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_of_Ansbach "Caroline of Ansbach"), the consort of her grandson, the future [George II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain "George II of Great Britain"). To each of these women he was correspondent, adviser, and friend. In turn, they all approved of Leibniz more than did their spouses and the future king [George I of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_I_of_Great_Britain "George I of Great Britain").[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-60)

The population of Hanover was only about 10,000, and its provinciality eventually grated on Leibniz. Nevertheless, to be a major courtier to the House of [Brunswick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg "Brunswick-Lüneburg") was quite an honor, especially in light of the meteoric rise in the prestige of that House during Leibniz's association with it. In 1692, the Duke of Brunswick became a hereditary Elector of the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire"). The British [Act of Settlement 1701](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701 "Act of Settlement 1701") designated the Electress Sophia and her descent as the royal family of England, once both King [William III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England "William III of England") and his sister-in-law and successor, [Queen Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain "Anne, Queen of Great Britain"), were dead. Leibniz played a role in the initiatives and negotiations leading up to that Act, but not always an effective one. For example, something he published anonymously in England, thinking to promote the Brunswick cause, was formally censured by the [British Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Parliament "British Parliament").

The Brunswicks tolerated the enormous effort Leibniz devoted to intellectual pursuits unrelated to his duties as a courtier, pursuits such as perfecting calculus, writing about other mathematics, logic, physics, and philosophy, and keeping up a vast correspondence. He began working on calculus in 1674; the earliest evidence of its use in his surviving notebooks is 1675. By 1677 he had a coherent system in hand, but did not publish it until 1684. Leibniz's most important mathematical papers were published between 1682 and 1692, usually in a journal which he and [Otto Mencke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Mencke "Otto Mencke") founded in 1682, the _[Acta Eruditorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acta\_Eruditorum "Acta Eruditorum")_. That journal played a key role in advancing his mathematical and scientific reputation, which in turn enhanced his eminence in diplomacy, history, theology, and philosophy.

Pages from Leibniz's papers in the [National Library of Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Library_of_Poland "National Library of Poland")

The Elector [Ernest Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Augustus,_Elector_of_Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg "Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg") commissioned Leibniz to write a history of the House of Brunswick, going back to the time of [Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne "Charlemagne") or earlier, hoping that the resulting book would advance his dynastic ambitions. From 1687 to 1690, Leibniz traveled extensively in Germany, Austria, and Italy, seeking and finding archival materials bearing on this project. Decades went by but no history appeared; the next Elector became quite annoyed at Leibniz's apparent dilatoriness. Leibniz never finished the project, in part because of his huge output on many other fronts, but also because he insisted on writing a meticulously researched and erudite book based on archival sources, when his patrons would have been quite happy with a short popular book, one perhaps little more than a [genealogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy "Genealogy") with commentary, to be completed in three years or less. They never knew that he had in fact carried out a fair part of his assigned task: when the material Leibniz had written and collected for his history of the House of Brunswick was finally published in the 19th century, it filled three volumes.

Leibniz was appointed Librarian of the [Herzog August Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzog_August_Library "Herzog August Library") in [Wolfenbüttel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenb%C3%BCttel "Wolfenbüttel"), [Lower Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Saxony "Lower Saxony"), in 1691.

In 1708, [John Keill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keill "John Keill"), writing in the journal of the Royal Society and with Newton's presumed blessing, accused Leibniz of having plagiarised Newton's calculus.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-61) Thus began the [calculus priority dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_v._Leibniz_calculus_controversy "Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy") which darkened the remainder of Leibniz's life. A formal investigation by the Royal Society (in which Newton was an unacknowledged participant), undertaken in response to Leibniz's demand for a retraction, upheld Keill's charge. Historians of mathematics writing since 1900 or so have tended to acquit Leibniz, pointing to important differences between Leibniz's and Newton's versions of calculus.

In 1712, Leibniz began a two-year residence in Vienna, where he was appointed [Imperial Court Councillor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichshofrat "Reichshofrat") to the [Habsburgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg "Habsburg"). On the death of Queen Anne in 1714, Elector George Louis became King [George I of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_I_of_Great_Britain "George I of Great Britain"), under the terms of the 1701 Act of Settlement. Even though Leibniz had done much to bring about this happy event, it was not to be his hour of glory. Despite the intercession of the Princess of Wales, Caroline of Ansbach, George I forbade Leibniz to join him in London until he completed at least one volume of the history of the Brunswick family his father had commissioned nearly 30 years earlier. Moreover, for George I to include Leibniz in his London court would have been deemed insulting to Newton, who was seen as having won the calculus priority dispute and whose standing in British official circles could not have been higher. Finally, his dear friend and defender, the Dowager Electress Sophia, died in 1714. In 1716, while traveling in northern Europe, the Russian [Tsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")[Peter the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_I_of_Russia "Peter I of Russia") stopped in [Bad Pyrmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Pyrmont "Bad Pyrmont") and met Leibniz, who took interest in Russian matters since 1708 and was appointed advisor in 1711.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-62)

Leibniz died in [Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover "Hanover") in 1716. At the time, he was so out of favor that neither George I (who happened to be near Hanover at that time) nor any fellow courtier other than his personal secretary attended the funeral. Even though Leibniz was a life member of the Royal Society and the [Berlin Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences "Prussian Academy of Sciences"), neither organization saw fit to honor his death. His grave went unmarked for more than 50 years. He was, however, eulogized by [Fontenelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_de_Fontenelle "Bernard de Fontenelle"), before the [French Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences "French Academy of Sciences") in Paris, which had admitted him as a foreign member in 1700. The eulogy was composed at the behest of the [Duchess of Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Charlotte,_Princess_Palatine "Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine"), a niece of the Electress Sophia.

Leibniz never married. He proposed to an unknown woman at age 50, but changed his mind when she took too long to decide.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-63) He complained on occasion about money, but the fair sum he left to his sole heir, his sister's stepson, proved that the Brunswicks had paid him fairly well. In his diplomatic endeavors, he at times verged on the unscrupulous, as was often the case with professional diplomats of his day. On several occasions, Leibniz backdated and altered personal manuscripts, actions which put him in a bad light during the [calculus controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_v._Leibniz_calculus_controversy "Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy").[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-64)

He was charming, well-mannered, and not without humor and imagination.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-65) He had many friends and admirers all over Europe. He was identified as a [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant "Protestant") and a [philosophical theist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_theism "Philosophical theism").[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-66)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-67)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-68)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-69) Leibniz remained committed to [Trinitarian Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitarian_Christianity "Trinitarian Christianity") throughout his life.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-70)

Leibniz's philosophical thinking appears fragmented because his philosophical writings consist mainly of a multitude of short pieces: journal articles, manuscripts published long after his death, and letters to correspondents. He wrote two book-length philosophical treatises, of which only the _Théodicée_ of 1710 was published in his lifetime.

Leibniz dated his beginning as a philosopher to his _[Discourse on Metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse\_on\_Metaphysics "Discourse on Metaphysics")_, which he composed in 1686 as a commentary on a running dispute between [Nicolas Malebranche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Malebranche "Nicolas Malebranche") and [Antoine Arnauld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Arnauld "Antoine Arnauld"). This led to an extensive correspondence with Arnauld;[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-71) it and the _Discourse_ were not published until the 19th century. In 1695, Leibniz made his public entrée into European philosophy with a journal article titled "New System of the Nature and Communication of Substances".[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-72) Between 1695 and 1705, he composed his _[New Essays on Human Understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Essays\_on\_Human\_Understanding "New Essays on Human Understanding")_, a lengthy commentary on [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke")'s 1690 _[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An\_Essay\_Concerning\_Human\_Understanding "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding")_, but upon learning of Locke's 1704 death, lost the desire to publish it, so that the _New Essays_ were not published until 1765. The _[Monadologie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology "Monadology")_, composed in 1714 and published posthumously, consists of 90 aphorisms.

Leibniz also wrote a short paper, "Primae veritates" ("First Truths"), first published by [Louis Couturat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Couturat "Louis Couturat") in 1903 (pp.518–523)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-73) summarizing his views on [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"). The paper is undated; that he wrote it while in Vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677–1690.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-74) Couturat's reading of this paper influenced much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among [analytic philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy "Analytic philosophy"). After a meticulous study (informed by the 1999 additions to the critical edition) of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688, Mercer (2001) disagreed with Couturat's reading.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]

Leibniz met [Baruch Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza "Baruch Spinoza") in 1676, read some of his unpublished writings, and had since been influenced by some of Spinoza's ideas.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] While Leibniz befriended him and admired Spinoza's powerful intellect, he was also dismayed by Spinoza's conclusions,[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-75) especially when these were inconsistent with Christian orthodoxy.

Unlike Descartes and Spinoza, Leibniz had a university education in philosophy. He was influenced by his [Leipzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig "Leipzig") professor [Jakob Thomasius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Thomasius "Jakob Thomasius"), who also supervised his BA thesis in philosophy.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Arthur_p._13-9) Leibniz also read [Francisco Suárez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Su%C3%A1rez "Francisco Suárez"), a Spanish [Jesuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus "Society of Jesus") respected even in [Lutheran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism "Lutheranism") universities. Leibniz was deeply interested in the new methods and conclusions of Descartes, Huygens, Newton, and [Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle "Robert Boyle"), but the established philosophical ideas in which he was educated influenced his view of their work.

Leibniz variously invoked one or another of seven fundamental philosophical Principles:[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-76)

*   [Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(mathematics) "Identity (mathematics)")/[contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction "Contradiction"). If a proposition is true, then its negation is false and vice versa.
*   [Identity of indiscernibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles "Identity of indiscernibles"). Two distinct things cannot have all their properties in common. If every predicate possessed by _x_ is also possessed by _y_ and vice versa, then entities _x_ and _y_ are identical; to suppose two things indiscernible is to suppose the same thing under two names. The "identity of indiscernibles" is frequently invoked in modern logic and philosophy. It has attracted the most controversy and criticism, especially from corpuscular philosophy and quantum mechanics.

Leibniz would on occasion give a rational defense of a specific principle, but more often took them for granted.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-82)

A page from Leibniz's manuscript of the _[Monadology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology "Monadology")_

Leibniz's best known contribution to [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") is his theory of [monads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(philosophy) "Monad (philosophy)"), as exposited in _[Monadologie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology "Monadology")_. He proposes his theory that the universe is made of an infinite number of simple substances known as monads.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-83) Monads can also be compared to the corpuscles of the [mechanical philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_philosophy "Mechanical philosophy") of René Descartes and others. These simple substances or monads are the "ultimate units of existence in nature". Monads have no parts but still exist by the qualities that they have. These qualities are continuously changing over time, and each monad is unique. They are also not affected by time and are subject to only creation and annihilation.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-84) Monads are centers of [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force"); substance is force, while [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space"), [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), and [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") are merely phenomenal. He argued, against Newton, that [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space"), [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"), and motion are completely relative:[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Ferraro-85) "As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions."[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-See_H._G_pp._25-86) Einstein, who called himself a "Leibnizian", wrote in the introduction to [Max Jammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Jammer "Max Jammer")'s book _Concepts of Space_ that Leibnizianism was superior to Newtonianism, and his ideas would have dominated over Newton's had it not been for the poor technological tools of the time; Joseph Agassi argues that Leibniz paved the way for Einstein's [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity").[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-87)

Leibniz's proof of God can be summarized in the _[Théodicée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odic%C3%A9e "Théodicée")_.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Leibniz:_A_Guide_for_the_Perplexed-88) Reason is governed by the [principle of contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_contradiction "Principle of contradiction") and the [principle of sufficient reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_sufficient_reason "Principle of sufficient reason"). Using the principle of reasoning, Leibniz concluded that the first reason of all things is God.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Leibniz:_A_Guide_for_the_Perplexed-88) All that we see and experience is subject to change, and the fact that this world is contingent can be explained by the possibility of the world being arranged differently in space and time. The contingent world must have some necessary reason for its existence. Leibniz uses a geometry book as an example to explain his reasoning. If this book was copied from an infinite chain of copies, there must be some reason for the content of the book.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-89) Leibniz concluded that there must be the "_monas monadum_" or God.

The [ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology "Ontology") essence of a monad is its irreducible simplicity. Unlike atoms, monads possess no material or spatial character. They also differ from atoms by their complete mutual independence, so that interactions among monads are only apparent. Instead, by virtue of the principle of [pre-established harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-established_harmony "Pre-established harmony"), each monad follows a pre-programmed set of "instructions" peculiar to itself, so that a monad "knows" what to do at each moment. By virtue of these intrinsic instructions, each monad is like a little mirror of the universe. Monads need not be "small"; e.g., each human being constitutes a monad, in which case [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will "Free will") is problematic.

Monads are purported to have gotten rid of the problematic:

*   interaction between [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind") and matter arising in the system of [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes");
*   lack of [individuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_individuation "Principle of individuation") inherent to the system of [Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinoza "Spinoza"), which represents individual creatures as merely accidental.

### Theodicy and optimism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Theodicy and optimism")]

The _[Theodicy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odic%C3%A9e "Théodicée")_[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-90) tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is [optimal among all possible worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_all_possible_worlds "Best of all possible worlds"). It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all-powerful and all-knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-91)

Leibniz asserted that the truths of theology (religion) and philosophy cannot contradict each other, since reason and faith are both "gifts of God" so that their conflict would imply God contending against himself. The _Theodicy_ is Leibniz's attempt to reconcile his personal philosophical system with his interpretation of the tenets of Christianity.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-92) This project was motivated in part by Leibniz's belief, shared by many philosophers and theologians during the [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment"), in the rational and enlightened nature of the Christian religion. It was also shaped by Leibniz's belief in the perfectibility of human nature (if humanity relied on correct philosophy and religion as a guide), and by his belief that metaphysical necessity must have a rational or logical foundation, even if this metaphysical causality seemed inexplicable in terms of physical necessity (the natural laws identified by science).

In the view of Leibniz, because reason and faith must be entirely reconciled, any tenet of faith which could not be defended by reason must be rejected. Leibniz then approached one of the central criticisms of Christian theism:[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-93) if God is [all good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibenevolence "Omnibenevolence"), [all wise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience "Omniscience"), and [all powerful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence "Omnipotence"), then how did [evil come into the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil "Problem of evil")? The answer (according to Leibniz) is that, while God is indeed unlimited in wisdom and power, his human creations, as creations, are limited both in their wisdom and in their will (power to act). This predisposes humans to false beliefs, wrong decisions, and ineffective actions in the exercise of their [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will "Free will"). God does not arbitrarily inflict pain and suffering on humans; rather he permits both _moral evil_ (sin) and _physical evil_ (pain and suffering) as the necessary consequences of _metaphysical evil_ (imperfection), as a means by which humans can identify and correct their erroneous decisions, and as a contrast to true good.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-94)

Further, although human actions flow from prior causes that ultimately arise in God and therefore are known to God as metaphysical certainties, an individual's free will is exercised within natural laws, where choices are merely contingently necessary and to be decided in the event by a "wonderful spontaneity" that provides individuals with an escape from rigorous predestination.

### _Discourse on Metaphysics_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Discourse on Metaphysics")]

For Leibniz, "God is an absolutely perfect being". He describes this perfection later in section VI as the simplest form of something with the most substantial outcome (VI). Along these lines, he declares that every type of perfection "pertains to him (God) in the highest degree" (I). Even though his types of perfections are not specifically drawn out, Leibniz highlights the one thing that, to him, does certify imperfections and proves that God is perfect: "that one acts imperfectly if he acts with less perfection than he is capable of", and since God is a perfect being, he cannot act imperfectly (III). Because God cannot act imperfectly, the decisions he makes pertaining to the world must be perfect. Leibniz also comforts readers, stating that because he has done everything to the most perfect degree; those who love him cannot be injured. However, to love God is a subject of difficulty as Leibniz believes that we are "not disposed to wish for that which God desires" because we have the ability to alter our disposition (IV). In accordance with this, many act as rebels, but Leibniz says that the only way we can truly love God is by being content "with all that comes to us according to his will" (IV).

Because God is "an absolutely perfect being" (I), Leibniz argues that God would be acting imperfectly if he acted with any less perfection than what he is able of (III). His syllogism then ends with the statement that God has made the world perfectly in all ways. This also affects how we should view God and his will. Leibniz states that, in lieu of God's will, we have to understand that God "is the best of all masters" and he will know when his good succeeds, so we, therefore, must act in conformity to his good will—or as much of it as we understand (IV). In our view of God, Leibniz declares that we cannot admire the work solely because of the maker, lest we mar the glory and love God in doing so. Instead, we must admire the maker for the work he has done (II). Effectively, Leibniz states that if we say the earth is good because of the will of God, and not good according to some standards of goodness, then how can we praise God for what he has done if contrary actions are also praiseworthy by this definition (II). Leibniz then asserts that different principles and geometry cannot simply be from the will of God, but must follow from his understanding.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-95)

Leibniz wrote: "[Why is there something rather than nothing?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_why_there_is_anything_at_all "Problem of why there is anything at all") The sufficient reason ... is found in a substance which ... is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself."[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-96)[Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger "Martin Heidegger") called this question "the fundamental question of metaphysics".[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-97)[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-98)

### Symbolic thought and rational resolution of disputes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Symbolic thought and rational resolution of disputes")]

Leibniz believed that much of human reasoning could be reduced to calculations of a sort, and that such calculations could resolve many differences of opinion:

> The only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate, without further ado, to see who is right.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-99)[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-100)[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-101)

Leibniz's [calculus ratiocinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_ratiocinator "Calculus ratiocinator"), which resembles [symbolic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"), can be viewed as a way of making such calculations feasible. Leibniz wrote memoranda[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-102) that can now be read as groping attempts to get symbolic logic—and thus his _calculus_—off the ground. These writings remained unpublished until the appearance of a selection edited by Carl Immanuel Gerhardt (1859). [Louis Couturat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Couturat "Louis Couturat") published a selection in 1901; by this time the main developments of modern logic had been created by [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce "Charles Sanders Peirce") and by [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege "Gottlob Frege").

Leibniz thought [symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol "Symbol") were important for human understanding. He attached so much importance to the development of good notations that he attributed all his discoveries in mathematics to this. His notation for [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") is an example of his skill in this regard. Leibniz's passion for symbols and notation, as well as his belief that these are essential to a well-running logic and mathematics, made him a precursor of [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics "Semiotics").[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-103)

But Leibniz took his speculations much further. Defining a [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme "Grapheme") as any written sign, he then defined a "real" character as one that represents an idea directly and not simply as the word embodying the idea. Some real characters, such as the notation of logic, serve only to facilitate reasoning. Many characters well known in his day, including [Egyptian hieroglyphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphics "Egyptian hieroglyphics"), [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_character "Chinese character"), and the symbols of [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") and [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), he deemed not real.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-104) Instead, he proposed the creation of a _[characteristica universalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica\_universalis "Characteristica universalis")_ or "universal characteristic", built on an [alphabet of human thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_of_human_thought "Alphabet of human thought") in which each fundamental concept would be represented by a unique "real" character:

> It is obvious that if we could find characters or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines, we could do in all matters _insofar as they are subject to reasoning_ all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry. For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-105)

Complex thoughts would be represented by combining characters for simpler thoughts. Leibniz saw that the uniqueness of [prime factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factorization "Prime factorization") suggests a central role for [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_numbers "Prime numbers") in the universal characteristic, a striking anticipation of [Gödel numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering "Gödel numbering"). Granted, there is no intuitive or [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic "Mnemonic") way to number any set of elementary concepts using the prime numbers.

Because Leibniz was a mathematical novice when he first wrote about the _characteristic_, at first he did not conceive it as an [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") but rather as a [universal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_characteristic "Universal characteristic") or script. Only in 1676 did he conceive of a kind of "algebra of thought", modeled on and including conventional algebra and its notation. The resulting _characteristic_ included a logical calculus, some combinatorics, algebra, his _analysis situs_ (geometry of situation), a universal concept language, and more. What Leibniz actually intended by his _characteristica universalis_ and calculus ratiocinator, and the extent to which modern formal logic does justice to calculus, may never be established.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-106) Leibniz's idea of reasoning through a universal language of symbols and calculations remarkably foreshadows great 20th-century developments in formal systems, such as [Turing completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness "Turing completeness"), where computation was used to define equivalent universal languages (see [Turing degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_degree "Turing degree")).

Leibniz has been noted as one of the most important logicians between the times of Aristotle and [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege "Gottlob Frege").[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-107) Leibniz enunciated the principal properties of what we now call [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction "Logical conjunction"), [disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunction "Disjunction"), [negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation "Negation"), [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(mathematics) "Identity (mathematics)"), set [inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset"), and the [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set "Empty set"). The principles of Leibniz's logic and, arguably, of his whole philosophy, reduce to two:

1.   All our ideas are compounded from a very small number of simple ideas, which form the [alphabet of human thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_of_human_thought "Alphabet of human thought").
2.   Complex ideas proceed from these simple ideas by a uniform and symmetrical combination, analogous to arithmetical multiplication.

The formal logic that emerged early in the 20th century also requires, at minimum, [unary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_function "Unary function") negation and [quantified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification_(logic) "Quantification (logic)")[variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)") ranging over some [universe of discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe_of_discourse "Universe of discourse").

Leibniz published nothing on formal logic in his lifetime; most of what he wrote on the subject consists of working drafts. In his _[History of Western Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_History\_of\_Western\_Philosophy "A History of Western Philosophy")_, [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") went so far as to claim that Leibniz had developed logic in his unpublished writings to a level which was reached only 200 years later.

Russell's principal work on Leibniz found that many of Leibniz's most startling philosophical ideas and claims (e.g., that each of the fundamental [monads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(philosophy) "Monad (philosophy)") mirrors the whole universe) follow logically from Leibniz's conscious choice to reject _relations_ between things as unreal. He regarded such relations as (real) _qualities_ of things (Leibniz admitted [unary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_function "Unary function")[predicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic) "Predicate (mathematical logic)") only): For him, "Mary is the mother of John" describes separate qualities of Mary and of John. This view contrasts with the relational logic of [De Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_De_Morgan "Augustus De Morgan"), [Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_S._Peirce "Charles S. Peirce"), [Schröder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Schr%C3%B6der_(mathematician) "Ernst Schröder (mathematician)") and Russell himself, now standard in [predicate logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_logic "Predicate logic"). Notably, Leibniz also declared space and time to be inherently relational.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-108)

Leibniz's 1690 discovery of his **algebra of concepts**[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-109)[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-110) (deductively equivalent to the [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra "Boolean algebra"))[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-111) and the associated metaphysics, are of interest in present-day [computational metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_metaphysics "Computational metaphysics").[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-112)

Although the mathematical notion of [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") was implicit in trigonometric and logarithmic tables, which existed in his day, Leibniz was the first, in 1692 and 1694, to employ it explicitly, to denote any of several geometric concepts derived from a curve, such as [abscissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscissa "Abscissa"), [ordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinate "Ordinate"), [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent "Tangent"), [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(geometry) "Chord (geometry)"), and the [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry) "Normal (geometry)") (see [History of the function concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_function_concept "History of the function concept")).[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-113) In the 18th century, "function" lost these geometrical associations. Leibniz was also one of the pioneers in [actuarial science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science "Actuarial science"), calculating the purchase price of life annuities and the liquidation of a state's debt.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-114)

Leibniz's research into formal logic, also relevant to mathematics, is discussed in the [preceding section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#Formal_logic). The best overview of Leibniz's writings on calculus may be found in Bos (1974).[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Douglas_M._Jesseph,_1998-115)

Leibniz, who invented one of the earliest mechanical calculators, said of [calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation "Calculation"): "For it is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labor of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used."[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-116)

Leibniz arranged the coefficients of a system of [linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation") into an array, now called a [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)"), in order to find a solution to the system if it existed.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-117) This method was later called [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination "Gaussian elimination"). Leibniz laid down the foundations and theory of [determinants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinants "Determinants"), although the Japanese mathematician [Seki Takakazu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seki_Takakazu "Seki Takakazu") also discovered determinants independently of Leibniz.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-118)[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Princeton_University_Press-119) His works show calculating the determinants using cofactors.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-120) Calculating the determinant using cofactors is named the [Leibniz formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_determinants "Leibniz formula for determinants"). Finding the determinant of a matrix using this method proves impractical with large _n_, requiring to calculate _n!_ products and the number of n-permutations.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-121) He also solved systems of linear equations using determinants, which is now called [Cramer's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule "Cramer's rule"). This method for solving systems of linear equations based on determinants was found in 1684 by Leibniz ([Gabriel Cramer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Cramer "Gabriel Cramer") published his findings in 1750).[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Princeton_University_Press-119) Although Gaussian elimination requires ![Image 8: {\displaystyle O(n^{3})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b04f5c5cfea38f43406d9442387ad28555e2609) arithmetic operations, linear algebra textbooks still teach cofactor expansion before [LU factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_factorization "LU factorization").[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-122)[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-123)

Leibniz wrote that circles "can most simply be expressed by this series, that is, the aggregate of fractions alternately added and subtracted".[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-124) However this formula is only accurate with a large number of terms, using 10,000,000 terms to obtain the correct value of ⁠π/4⁠ to 8 decimal places.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-125) Leibniz attempted to create a definition for a straight line while attempting to prove the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate").[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-126) While most mathematicians defined a straight line as the shortest line between two points, Leibniz believed that this was merely a property of a straight line rather than the definition.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-127)

Leibniz is credited, along with [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), with the invention of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") (differential and integral calculus). According to Leibniz's notebooks, a critical breakthrough occurred on 11 November 1675, when he employed integral calculus for the first time to find the area under the graph of a function y = f(x).[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Leibniz1920-128) He introduced several notations used to this day, for instance the [integral sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_sign "Integral sign")∫ (![Image 10: {\displaystyle \displaystyle \int f(x)\,dx}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d08972355789baf238cd41a5ad7af85878ba3928)), representing an elongated S, from the Latin word _summa_, and the d used for [differentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(infinitesimal) "Differential (infinitesimal)") (![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ceb16b58a91d26cf1e442d0682dfa7a2c0ab72c)), from the Latin word _differentia_. Leibniz did not publish anything about his calculus until 1684.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-129) Leibniz expressed the inverse relation of integration and differentiation, later called the [fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus "Fundamental theorem of calculus"), by means of a figure[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-130) in his 1693 paper _Supplementum geometriae dimensoriae..._.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-131) However, [James Gregory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gregory_(mathematician) "James Gregory (mathematician)") is credited for the theorem's discovery in geometric form, [Isaac Barrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Barrow "Isaac Barrow") proved a more generalized geometric version, and [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") developed supporting theory. The concept became more transparent as developed through Leibniz's formalism and new notation.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-132) The [product rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule "Product rule") of [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus "Differential calculus") is still called "Leibniz's law". In addition, the theorem that tells how and when to differentiate under the integral sign is called the [Leibniz integral rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_integral_rule "Leibniz integral rule").

Leibniz exploited [infinitesimals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") in developing calculus, manipulating them in ways suggesting that they had [paradoxical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox "Paradox")[algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") properties. [George Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley "George Berkeley"), in a tract called _[The Analyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Analyst "The Analyst")_ and also in _De Motu_, criticized these. A recent study argues that Leibnizian calculus was free of contradictions, and was better grounded than Berkeley's empiricist criticisms.[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-133)

Leibniz introduced [fractional calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_calculus "Fractional calculus") in a letter written to [Guillaume de l'Hôpital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_de_l%27H%C3%B4pital "Guillaume de l'Hôpital") in 1695.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Derivative-31) At the same time, Leibniz wrote to [Johann Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bernoulli "Johann Bernoulli") about derivatives of "general order".[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-:12-30) In the correspondence between Leibniz and [John Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis "John Wallis") in 1697, Wallis's infinite product for ![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a11cfb2fdb143693b1daf78fcb5c11a023cb1c55)π is discussed. Leibniz suggested using differential calculus to achieve this result. Leibniz further used the notation ![Image 13: {\displaystyle {d}^{1/2}{y}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/78c02c39608ab4adde1a58aa662b62494371aad8) to denote the derivative of order ![Image 14: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a11cfb2fdb143693b1daf78fcb5c11a023cb1c55).[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-:12-30)

From 1711 until his death, Leibniz was engaged in a dispute with [John Keill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keill "John Keill"), Newton and others, over [whether Leibniz had invented calculus independently of Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Newton_calculus_controversy "Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy").

The use of infinitesimals in mathematics was frowned upon by followers of [Karl Weierstrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Weierstrass "Karl Weierstrass"),[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-134) but survived in science and engineering, and even in rigorous mathematics, via the fundamental computational device known as the [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(infinitesimal) "Differential (infinitesimal)"). Beginning in 1960, [Abraham Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Robinson "Abraham Robinson") worked out a rigorous foundation for Leibniz's infinitesimals, using [model theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory "Model theory"), in the context of a field of [hyperreal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number "Hyperreal number"). The resulting [non-standard analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_analysis "Non-standard analysis") can be seen as a belated vindication of Leibniz's mathematical reasoning. Robinson's [transfer principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_principle "Transfer principle") is a mathematical implementation of Leibniz's heuristic [law of continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_continuity "Law of continuity"), while the [standard part function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_part_function "Standard part function") implements the Leibnizian [transcendental law of homogeneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_law_of_homogeneity "Transcendental law of homogeneity").

Leibniz was the first to use the term _analysis situs_,[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-135) later used in the 19th century to refer to what is now known as [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"). There are two takes on this situation. On the one hand, Mates, citing a 1954 paper in German by [Jacob Freudenthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Freudenthal "Jacob Freudenthal"), argues:

> Although for Leibniz the situs of a sequence of points is completely determined by the distance between them and is altered if those distances are altered, his admirer [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler "Euler"), in the famous 1736 paper solving the [Königsberg Bridge Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg "Seven Bridges of Königsberg") and its generalizations, used the term _geometria situs_ in such a sense that the situs remains unchanged under topological deformations. He mistakenly credits Leibniz with originating this concept. ... [It] is sometimes not realized that Leibniz used the term in an entirely different sense and hence can hardly be considered the founder of that part of mathematics.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-136)

But Hideaki Hirano argues differently, quoting [Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot "Benoit Mandelbrot"):[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-137)

> To sample Leibniz' scientific works is a sobering experience. Next to calculus, and to other thoughts that have been carried out to completion, the number and variety of premonitory thrusts is overwhelming. We saw examples in "packing",... My Leibniz mania is further reinforced by finding that for one moment its hero attached importance to geometric scaling. In _Euclidis Prota_..., which is an attempt to tighten Euclid's axioms, he states...: "I have diverse definitions for the straight line. The straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole, and it alone has this property, not only among curves but among sets." This claim can be proved today.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-138)

Thus the [fractal geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal "Fractal") promoted by Mandelbrot drew on Leibniz's notions of [self-similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity "Self-similarity") and the principle of continuity: _[Natura non facit saltus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natura\_non\_facit\_saltus "Natura non facit saltus")_.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Saltus-79) We also see that when Leibniz wrote, in a metaphysical vein, that "the straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole", he was anticipating topology by more than two centuries. As for "packing", Leibniz told his friend and correspondent Des Bosses to imagine a circle, then to inscribe within it three congruent circles with maximum radius; the latter smaller circles could be filled with three even smaller circles by the same procedure. This process can be continued infinitely, from which arises a good idea of self-similarity. Leibniz's improvement of Euclid's axiom contains the same concept.

He envisioned the field of [combinatorial topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_topology "Combinatorial topology") as early as 1679, in his work titled _Characteristica Geometrica,_ as he "tried to formulate basic geometric properties of figures, to use special symbols to represent them, and to combine these properties under operations so as to produce new ones."[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-:2-29)

Science and engineering
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Science and engineering")]

Leibniz's writings are currently discussed, not only for their anticipations and possible discoveries not yet recognized, but as ways of advancing present knowledge. Much of his writing on physics is included in Gerhardt's _Mathematical Writings_.

Leibniz contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging around him, often disagreeing with [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes") and [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"). He devised a new theory of [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") ([dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics) "Dynamics (mechanics)")) based on [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") and [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy"), which posited space as relative, whereas Newton was thoroughly convinced that space was absolute. An important example of Leibniz's mature physical thinking is his _Specimen Dynamicum_ of 1695.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-139)

Until the discovery of subatomic particles and the [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") governing them, many of Leibniz's speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense. For instance, he anticipated [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") by arguing, against Newton, that [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space"), time and motion are relative, not absolute: "As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions."[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-See_H._G_pp._25-86)

Leibniz held a [relational notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory "Relational theory") of space and time, against Newton's substantivalist views.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-140)[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-141)[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-142) According to Newton's substantivalism, space and time are entities in their own right, existing independently of things. Leibniz's relationalism, in contrast, describes [space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_and_time "Space and time") as systems of relations that exist between objects. The rise of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") and subsequent work in the [history of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_physics "History of physics") has put Leibniz's stance in a more favorable light.

One of Leibniz's projects was to recast Newton's theory as a [vortex theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_explanations_of_gravitation "Mechanical explanations of gravitation").[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Arthur_p._56-143) However, his project went beyond vortex theory, since at its heart there was an attempt to explain one of the most difficult problems in physics, that of the origin of the [cohesion of matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(chemistry) "Cohesion (chemistry)").[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Arthur_p._56-143)

The [principle of sufficient reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_sufficient_reason "Principle of sufficient reason") has been invoked in recent [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), and his [identity of indiscernibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles "Identity of indiscernibles") in quantum mechanics, a field some even credit him with having anticipated in some sense. In addition to his theories about the nature of reality, Leibniz's contributions to the development of calculus have also had a major impact on physics.

Leibniz's _[vis viva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis\_viva "Vis viva")_ (Latin for "living force") is m v 2, twice the modern [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy"). He realized that the total energy would be conserved in certain mechanical systems, so he considered it an innate motive characteristic of matter.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-144) Here too his thinking gave rise to another regrettable nationalistic dispute. His _vis viva_ was seen as rivaling the [conservation of momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_momentum "Conservation of momentum") championed by Newton in England and by [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes") and Voltaire in France; hence [academics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic "Academic") in those countries tended to neglect Leibniz's idea. Leibniz knew of the validity of conservation of momentum. In reality, both energy and [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") are conserved (in [closed systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_systems "Closed systems")), so both approaches are valid. In Einstein's [General Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Relativity "General Relativity"), energy and momentum are not separately conserved. This was thought to be fatal until [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether "Emmy Noether") showed that taken together, as the four-dimensional energy-momentum tensor, they are conserved.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-145)

### Other natural science

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Other natural science")]

By proposing that the Earth has a molten core, he anticipated modern geology. In [embryology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryology "Embryology"), he was a preformationist, but also proposed that organisms are the outcome of a combination of an infinite number of possible microstructures and of their powers. In the [life sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_sciences "Life sciences") and [paleontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology "Paleontology"), he revealed an amazing transformist intuition, fueled by his study of comparative anatomy and fossils. One of his principal works on this subject, _[Protogaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protogaea "Protogaea")_, unpublished in his lifetime, has recently been published in English for the first time. He worked out a primal [organismic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organismic_theory "Organismic theory").[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-146) In medicine, he exhorted the physicians of his time—with some results—to ground their theories in detailed comparative observations and verified experiments, and to distinguish firmly scientific and metaphysical points of view.

Psychology had been a central interest of Leibniz.[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-147)[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-148) He appears to be an "underappreciated pioneer of psychology"[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-149) He wrote on topics which are now regarded as fields of psychology: [attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention "Attention") and [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness"), [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory "Memory"), [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning "Learning") ([association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(psychology) "Association (psychology)")), [motivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation "Motivation") (the act of "striving"), emergent [individuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuality "Individuality"), the general dynamics of development ([evolutionary psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology "Evolutionary psychology")). His discussions in the _New Essays_ and _Monadology_ often rely on everyday observations such as the behaviour of a dog or the noise of the sea, and he develops intuitive analogies (the synchronous running of clocks or the balance spring of a clock). He also devised postulates and principles that apply to psychology: the continuum of the unnoticed _petites perceptions_ to the distinct, self-aware [apperception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apperception "Apperception"), and [psychophysical parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysical_parallelism "Psychophysical parallelism") from the point of view of causality and of purpose: "Souls act according to the laws of final causes, through aspirations, ends and means. Bodies act according to the laws of efficient causes, i.e. the laws of motion. And these two realms, that of efficient causes and that of final causes, harmonize with one another."[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-150) This idea refers to the mind-body problem, stating that the mind and brain do not act upon each other, but act alongside each other separately but in harmony.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-151) Leibniz, however, did not use the term _psychologia_.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-152) Leibniz's epistemological position—against [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke") and English [empiricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism") ([sensualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensualism "Sensualism"))—was made clear: "Nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu, nisi intellectu ipse." – "Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses, except the intellect itself."[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-153) Principles that are not present in sensory impressions can be recognised in human perception and consciousness: logical inferences, categories of thought, the principle of [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality") and the principle of purpose ([teleology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology "Teleology")).

Leibniz found his most important interpreter in [Wilhelm Wundt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt "Wilhelm Wundt"), founder of psychology as a discipline. Wundt used the "… nisi intellectu ipse" quotation 1862 on the title page of his _Beiträge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung_ (Contributions on the Theory of Sensory Perception) and published a detailed and aspiring monograph on Leibniz.[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-154) Wundt shaped the term [apperception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apperception "Apperception"), introduced by Leibniz, into an experimental psychologically based apperception psychology that included neuropsychological modelling – an excellent example of how a concept created by a great philosopher could stimulate a psychological research program. One principle in the thinking of Leibniz played a fundamental role: "the principle of equality of separate but corresponding viewpoints." Wundt characterized this style of thought ([perspectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspectivism "Perspectivism")) in a way that also applied for him—viewpoints that "supplement one another, while also being able to appear as opposites that only resolve themselves when considered more deeply."[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-155)[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-156) Much of Leibniz's work went on to have a great impact on the field of psychology.[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-157) Leibniz thought that there are many petites perceptions, or small perceptions of which we perceive but of which we are unaware. He believed that by the principle that phenomena found in nature were continuous by default, it was likely that the transition between conscious and unconscious states had intermediary steps.[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-158) For this to be true, there must also be a portion of the mind of which we are unaware at any given time. His theory regarding consciousness in relation to the principle of continuity can be seen as an early theory regarding the [stages of sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stages_of_sleep "Stages of sleep"). In this way, Leibniz's theory of perception can be viewed as one of many theories leading up to the idea of the [unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unconscious "The unconscious"). Leibniz was a direct influence on [Ernst Platner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Platner "Ernst Platner"), who is credited with originally coining the term Unbewußtseyn (unconscious).[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-159) Additionally, the idea of [subliminal stimuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subliminal_stimuli "Subliminal stimuli") can be traced back to his theory of small perceptions.[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-160) Leibniz's ideas regarding music and tonal perception went on to influence the laboratory studies of Wilhelm Wundt.[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-161)

In public health, he advocated establishing a medical administrative authority, with powers over [epidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology "Epidemiology") and [veterinary medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine "Veterinary medicine"). He worked to set up a coherent medical training program, oriented towards public health and preventive measures. In economic policy, he proposed tax reforms and a national insurance program, and discussed the [balance of trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade "Balance of trade"). He even proposed something akin to what much later emerged as [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory "Game theory"). In sociology he laid the ground for [communication theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_theory "Communication theory").

In 1906, Garland published a volume of Leibniz's writings bearing on his many practical inventions and engineering work. To date, few of these writings have been translated into English. Nevertheless, it is well understood that Leibniz was a serious inventor, engineer, and applied scientist, with great respect for practical life. Following the motto _theoria cum praxi_, he urged that theory be combined with practical application, and thus has been claimed as the father of [applied science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_science "Applied science"). He designed wind-driven propellers and water pumps, mining machines to extract ore, hydraulic presses, lamps, submarines, clocks, etc. With [Denis Papin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Papin "Denis Papin"), he created a [steam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine "Steam engine"). He even proposed a method for desalinating water. From 1680 to 1685, he struggled to overcome the chronic flooding that afflicted the ducal silver mines in the [Harz Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harz_Mountains "Harz Mountains"), but did not succeed.[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-162)

Leibniz may have been the first computer scientist and information theorist.[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-163) Early in life, he documented the [binary numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system "Binary numeral system") ([base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix "Radix") 2), then revisited that system throughout his career.[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-164) While Leibniz was examining other cultures to compare his metaphysical views, he encountered an ancient Chinese book _[I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I\_Ching "I Ching")_. Leibniz interpreted a diagram which showed yin and yang and corresponded it to a zero and one.[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-165) More information can be found in the [Sinophilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#Sinophilia) section. Leibniz had similarities with [Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Caramuel_y_Lobkowitz "Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz") and [Thomas Harriot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Harriot "Thomas Harriot"), who independently developed the binary system, as he was familiar with their works on the binary system.[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-166) Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz worked extensively on logarithms including logarithms with base 2.[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-167) Thomas Harriot's manuscripts contained a table of binary numbers and their notation, which demonstrated that any number could be written on a base 2 system.[[166]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-168) Regardless, Leibniz simplified the binary system and articulated logical properties such as conjunction, disjunction, negation, identity, inclusion, and the empty set.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-169) He anticipated [Lagrangian interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial "Lagrange polynomial") and [algorithmic information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_information_theory "Algorithmic information theory"). His [calculus ratiocinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_ratiocinator "Calculus ratiocinator") anticipated aspects of the [universal Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine "Universal Turing machine"). In 1961, [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener "Norbert Wiener") suggested that Leibniz should be considered the patron saint of [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics").[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-170) Wiener is quoted with "Indeed, the general idea of a computing machine is nothing but a mechanization of Leibniz's Calculus Ratiocinator."[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-171)

In 1671, Leibniz began to invent a machine that could execute all four arithmetic operations, gradually improving it over a number of years. This "[stepped reckoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepped_reckoner "Stepped reckoner")" attracted fair attention and was the basis of his election to the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society") in 1673. A number of such machines were made during his years in [Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover "Hanover") by a craftsman working under his supervision. They were not an unambiguous success because they did not fully mechanize the [carry operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(arithmetic) "Carry (arithmetic)"). Couturat reported finding an unpublished note by Leibniz, dated 1674, describing a machine capable of performing some algebraic operations.[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-172) Leibniz also devised a (now reproduced) cipher machine, recovered by [Nicholas Rescher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Rescher "Nicholas Rescher") in 2010.[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-173) In 1693, Leibniz described a design of a machine which could, in theory, integrate differential equations, which he called "integraph".[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-174)

Leibniz was groping towards hardware and software concepts worked out much later by [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage "Charles Babbage") and [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace "Ada Lovelace"). In 1679, while mulling over his binary arithmetic, Leibniz imagined a machine in which binary numbers were represented by marbles, governed by a rudimentary sort of punched cards.[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-175)[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-176) Modern electronic digital computers replace Leibniz's marbles moving by gravity with shift registers, voltage gradients, and pulses of electrons, but otherwise they run roughly as Leibniz envisioned in 1679.

Later in Leibniz's career (after the death of von Boyneburg), Leibniz moved to Paris and accepted a position as a librarian in the Hanoverian court of Johann Friedrich, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg.[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-177) Leibniz's predecessor, Tobias Fleischer, had already created a cataloging system for the Duke's library but it was a clumsy attempt. At this library, Leibniz focused more on advancing the library than on the cataloging. For instance, within a month of taking the new position, he developed a comprehensive plan to expand the library. He was one of the first to consider developing a core collection for a library and felt "that a library for display and ostentation is a luxury and indeed superfluous, but a well-stocked and organized library is important and useful for all areas of human endeavor and is to be regarded on the same level as schools and churches".[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-:0-178) Leibniz lacked the funds to develop the library in this manner. After working at this library, by the end of 1690 Leibniz was appointed as privy-councilor and librarian of the [Bibliotheca Augusta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzog_August_Library "Herzog August Library") at Wolfenbüttel. It was an extensive library with at least 25,946 printed volumes.[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-:0-178) At this library, Leibniz sought to improve the catalog. He was not allowed to make complete changes to the existing closed catalog, but was allowed to improve upon it so he started on that task immediately. He created an alphabetical author catalog and had also created other cataloging methods that were not implemented. While serving as librarian of the ducal libraries in [Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover "Hanover") and [Wolfenbüttel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenb%C3%BCttel "Wolfenbüttel"), Leibniz effectively became one of the founders of [library science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_science "Library science"). Seemingly, Leibniz paid a good deal of attention to the classification of subject matter, favoring a well-balanced library covering a host of numerous subjects and interests.[[177]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-:1-179) Leibniz, for example, proposed the following classification system in the _Otivm Hanoveranvm Sive Miscellanea_ (1737):[[177]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-:1-179)[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-180)

He also designed a book [indexing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_classification "Library classification") in ignorance of the only other such system then extant, that of the [Bodleian Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodleian_Library "Bodleian Library") at [Oxford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University "Oxford University"). He also called on publishers to distribute abstracts of all new titles they produced each year, in a standard form that would facilitate indexing. He hoped that this abstracting project would eventually include everything printed from his day back to [Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg "Johannes Gutenberg"). Neither proposal met with success at the time, but something like them became standard practice among English language publishers during the 20th century, under the aegis of the [Library of Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress "Library of Congress") and the [British Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Library "British Library").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

He called for the creation of an [empirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical "Empirical")[database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database "Database") as a way to further all sciences. His _[characteristica universalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica\_universalis "Characteristica universalis")_, [calculus ratiocinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_ratiocinator "Calculus ratiocinator"), and a "community of minds"—intended, among other things, to bring political and religious unity to Europe—can be seen as distant unwitting anticipations of artificial languages (e.g., [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto "Esperanto") and its rivals), [symbolic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"), even the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web").

### Advocate of scientific societies

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Advocate of scientific societies")]

Leibniz emphasized that research was a collaborative endeavor. Hence he warmly advocated the formation of national scientific societies along the lines of the [British Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society") and the French Académie Royale des Sciences. More specifically, in his correspondence and travels he urged the creation of such societies in Dresden, [Saint Petersburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg "Saint Petersburg"), Vienna, and Berlin. Only one such project came to fruition; in 1700, the [Berlin Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences "Prussian Academy of Sciences") was created. Leibniz drew up its first statutes, and served as its first President for the remainder of his life. That Academy evolved into the German Academy of Sciences, the publisher of the ongoing critical edition of his works.[[179]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-181)

Leibniz's writings on law, ethics, and politics[[180]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-182) were long overlooked by English-speaking scholars, but this has changed of late.[[181]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-183)

While Leibniz was no apologist for [absolute monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy") like [Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbes "Hobbes"), or for tyranny in any form, neither did he echo the political and constitutional views of his contemporary [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke"), views invoked in support of liberalism, in 18th-century America and later elsewhere. The following excerpt from a 1695 letter to Baron J. C. Boyneburg's son Philipp is very revealing of Leibniz's political sentiments:

> As for... the great question of the power of sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that it would be good for princes to be persuaded that their people have the [right to resist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_resist "Right to resist") them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of [Grotius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grotius "Grotius"), that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.[[182]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-184)

In 1677, Leibniz called for a European confederation, governed by a council or senate, whose members would represent entire nations and would be free to vote their consciences;[[183]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-185) this is sometimes considered an anticipation of the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union"). He believed that Europe would adopt a uniform religion. He reiterated these proposals in 1715.

But at the same time, he arrived to propose an interreligious and multicultural project to create a universal system of justice, which required from him a broad interdisciplinary perspective. In order to propose it, he combined linguistics (especially sinology), moral and legal philosophy, management, economics, and politics.[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-186)

Leibniz trained as a legal academic, but under the tutelage of Cartesian-sympathiser [Erhard Weigel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Weigel "Erhard Weigel") we already see an attempt to solve legal problems by rationalist mathematical methods (Weigel's influence being most explicit in the _Specimen Quaestionum Philosophicarum ex Jure collectarum_ (_An Essay of Collected Philosophical Problems of Right_)). For example, the _Disputatio Inauguralis de Casibus Perplexis in Jure_ (_Inaugural Disputation on Ambiguous Legal Cases_)[[185]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-187) uses early combinatorics to solve some legal disputes, while the 1666 _[De Arte Combinatoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Arte\_Combinatoria "De Arte Combinatoria")_ (_On the Art of Combination_)[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-188) includes simple legal problems by way of illustration.

The use of combinatorial methods to solve legal and moral problems seems, via [Athanasius Kircher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasius_Kircher "Athanasius Kircher") and [Daniel Schwenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Schwenter "Daniel Schwenter") to be of Llullist inspiration: [Ramón Llull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Llull "Ramón Llull") attempted to solve ecumenical disputes through recourse to a combinatorial mode of reasoning he regarded as universal (a mathesis universalis).[[187]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-189)

In the late 1660s the enlightened Prince-Bishop of Mainz [Johann Philipp von Schönborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Philipp_von_Sch%C3%B6nborn "Johann Philipp von Schönborn") announced a review of the legal system and made available a position to support his current law commissioner. Leibniz left Franconia and made for Mainz before even winning the role. On reaching [Frankfurt am Main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_am_Main "Frankfurt am Main") Leibniz penned The New Method of Teaching and Learning the Law, by way of application.[[188]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-190) The text proposed a reform of legal education and is characteristically syncretic, integrating aspects of Thomism, Hobbesianism, Cartesianism and traditional jurisprudence. Leibniz's argument that the function of legal teaching was not to impress rules as one might train a dog, but to aid the student in discovering their own public reason, evidently impressed von Schönborn as he secured the job.

Leibniz's next major attempt to find a universal rational core to law and so found a legal "science of right",[[189]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-191) came when Leibniz worked in Mainz from 1667–72. Starting initially from Hobbes' mechanistic doctrine of power, Leibniz reverted to logico-combinatorial methods in an attempt to define justice.[[190]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-192) As Leibniz's so-called _Elementa Juris Naturalis_ advanced, he built in modal notions of right (possibility) and obligation (necessity) in which we see perhaps the earliest elaboration of his possible worlds doctrine within a deontic frame.[[191]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-193) While ultimately the _Elementa_ remained unpublished, Leibniz continued to work on his drafts and promote their ideas to correspondents up until his death.

Leibniz devoted considerable intellectual and diplomatic effort to what would now be called an [ecumenical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenism "Ecumenism") endeavor, seeking to reconcile the [Roman Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") and [Lutheran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheran "Lutheran") churches. In this respect, he followed the example of his early patrons, Baron von Boyneburg and the Duke [John Frederick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frederick,_Duke_of_Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg "John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg")—both cradle Lutherans who converted to Catholicism as adults—who did what they could to encourage the reunion of the two faiths, and who warmly welcomed such endeavors by others. (The House of [Brunswick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg "Brunswick-Lüneburg") remained Lutheran, because the Duke's children did not follow their father.) These efforts included corresponding with French bishop [Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques-B%C3%A9nigne_Bossuet "Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet"), and involved Leibniz in some theological controversy. He evidently thought that the thoroughgoing application of reason would suffice to heal the breach caused by the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation").

Leibniz the [philologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philologist "Philologist") was an avid student of languages, eagerly latching on to any information about vocabulary and grammar that came his way. In 1710, he applied ideas of [gradualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradualism "Gradualism") and [uniformitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism "Uniformitarianism") to linguistics in a short essay.[[192]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-194) He refuted the belief, widely held by Christian scholars of the time, that [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language") was the primeval language of the human race. At the same time, he rejected the idea of unrelated language groups and considered them all to have a common source.[[193]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-195) He also refuted the argument, advanced by Swedish scholars in his day, that a form of proto-[Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language "Swedish language") was the ancestor of the [Germanic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages "Germanic languages"). He puzzled over the origins of the [Slavic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages "Slavic languages") and was fascinated by [classical Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Chinese "Classical Chinese"). Leibniz was also an expert in the [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit") language.[[194]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Springer,_Cham-196)

He published the _princeps editio_ (first modern edition) of the [late medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages "Late Middle Ages")_[Chronicon Holtzatiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicon\_Holtzatiae "Chronicon Holtzatiae")_, a Latin chronicle of the [County of Holstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Holstein "County of Holstein").

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Diagram_of_I_Ching_hexagrams_owned_by_Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz%2C_1701.jpg/250px-Diagram_of_I_Ching_hexagrams_owned_by_Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz%2C_1701.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diagram_of_I_Ching_hexagrams_owned_by_Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz,_1701.jpg)

A diagram of _[I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I\_Ching "I Ching")_ hexagrams sent to Leibniz from [Joachim Bouvet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Bouvet "Joachim Bouvet"). The Arabic numerals were added by Leibniz.[[195]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-197)

Leibniz was perhaps the first major European intellectual to take a close interest in Chinese civilization, which he knew by corresponding with, and reading other works by, [European Christian missionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_China_missions "Jesuit China missions") posted in China. He apparently read _[Confucius Sinarum Philosophus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe\_Couplet "Philippe Couplet")_ in the first year of its publication.[[196]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Mungello-198) He came to the conclusion that Europeans could learn much from the [Confucian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism "Confucianism") ethical tradition. He mulled over the possibility that the [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters "Chinese characters") were an unwitting form of his [universal characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica_universalis "Characteristica universalis"). He noted how the _[I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I\_Ching "I Ching")_ hexagrams correspond to the [binary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number "Binary number") from 000000 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired.[[197]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-199) Leibniz communicated his ideas of the binary system representing Christianity to the Emperor of China, hoping it would convert him.[[194]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Springer,_Cham-196) Leibniz was one of the western philosophers of the time who attempted to accommodate Confucian ideas to prevailing European beliefs.[[198]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-200)

Leibniz's attraction to [Chinese philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_philosophy "Chinese philosophy") originates from his perception that Chinese philosophy was similar to his own.[[196]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Mungello-198) The historian E.R. Hughes suggests that Leibniz's ideas of "simple substance" and "[pre-established harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-established_harmony "Pre-established harmony")" were directly influenced by Confucianism, pointing to the fact that they were conceived during the period when he was reading _Confucius Sinarum Philosophus_.[[196]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-Mungello-198)

While making his grand tour of European archives to research the Brunswick family history that he never completed, Leibniz stopped in Vienna between May 1688 and February 1689, where he did much legal and diplomatic work for the Brunswicks. He visited mines, talked with mine engineers, and tried to negotiate export contracts for lead from the ducal mines in the [Harz mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harz_mountains "Harz mountains"). His proposal that the streets of Vienna be lit with lamps burning [rapeseed oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeseed_oil "Rapeseed oil") was implemented. During a formal audience with the [Austrian Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor "Holy Roman Emperor") and in subsequent memoranda, he advocated reorganizing the Austrian economy, reforming the coinage of much of central Europe, negotiating a [Concordat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordat "Concordat") between the [Habsburgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg "Habsburg") and the [Vatican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See "Holy See"), and creating an imperial research library, official archive, and public insurance fund. He wrote and published an important paper on [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics").

Posthumous reputation

When Leibniz died, his reputation was in decline. He was remembered for only one book, the _[Théodicée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odic%C3%A9e "Théodicée")_,[[199]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-201) whose supposed central argument [Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire "Voltaire") lampooned in his popular book _[Candide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide "Candide")_, which concludes with the character Candide saying, "_[Non liquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non\_liquet "Non liquet")_" (it is not clear), a term that was applied during the Roman Republic to a legal verdict of "not proven". Voltaire's depiction of Leibniz's ideas was so influential that many believed it to be an accurate description. Thus Voltaire and his _Candide_ bear some of the blame for the lingering failure to appreciate and understand Leibniz's ideas. Leibniz had an ardent disciple, [Christian Wolff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Wolff_(philosopher) "Christian Wolff (philosopher)"), whose dogmatic and facile outlook did Leibniz's reputation much harm. Leibniz also influenced [David Hume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume "David Hume"), who read his _[Théodicée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odic%C3%A9e "Théodicée")_ and used some of his ideas.[[200]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-202) In any event, philosophical fashion was moving away from the rationalism and system building of the 17th century, of which Leibniz had been such an ardent proponent. His work on law, diplomacy, and history was seen as of ephemeral interest. The vastness and richness of his correspondence went unrecognized.

Leibniz's reputation began to recover with the 1765 publication of the _Nouveaux Essais_. In 1768, [Louis Dutens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Dutens "Louis Dutens") edited the first multi-volume edition of Leibniz's writings, followed in the 19th century by a number of editions, including those edited by Erdmann, Foucher de Careil, Gerhardt, Gerland, Klopp, and Mollat. Publication of Leibniz's correspondence with notables such as [Antoine Arnauld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Arnauld "Antoine Arnauld"), [Samuel Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Clarke "Samuel Clarke"), [Sophia of Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_of_Hanover "Sophia of Hanover"), and her daughter [Sophia Charlotte of Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Charlotte_of_Hanover "Sophia Charlotte of Hanover"), began.

In 1900, [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") published a critical study of Leibniz's [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics").[[201]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-203) Shortly thereafter, [Louis Couturat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Couturat "Louis Couturat") published an important study of Leibniz, and edited a volume of Leibniz's heretofore unpublished writings, mainly on logic. They made Leibniz somewhat respectable among 20th-century [analytical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy "Analytic philosophy") and [linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_philosophy "Linguistic philosophy") philosophers in the English-speaking world (Leibniz had already been of great influence to many Germans such as [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann")). For example, Leibniz's phrase _[salva veritate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salva\_veritate "Salva veritate")_, meaning interchangeability without loss of or compromising the truth, recurs in [Willard Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Quine "Willard Quine")'s writings. Nevertheless, the secondary literature on Leibniz did not really blossom until after World War II. This is especially true of English speaking countries; in Gregory Brown's bibliography fewer than 30 of the English language entries were published before 1946. American Leibniz studies owe much to [Leroy Loemker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leroy_Loemker "Leroy Loemker") (1900–1985) through his translations and his interpretive essays in LeClerc (1973). Leibniz's philosophy was also highly regarded by [Gilles Deleuze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze "Gilles Deleuze"),[[202]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-204) who in 1988 published [The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fold:_Leibniz_and_the_Baroque "The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque").

[Nicholas Jolley](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicholas_Jolley&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nicholas Jolley (page does not exist)") has surmised that Leibniz's reputation as a philosopher is now perhaps higher than at any time since he was alive.[[203]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-205) Analytic and contemporary philosophy continue to invoke his notions of [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy) "Identity (philosophy)"), [individuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_individuation "Principle of individuation"), and [possible worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_worlds "Possible worlds"). Work in the history of 17th- and 18th-century [ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_ideas "History of ideas") has revealed more clearly the 17th-century "Intellectual Revolution" that preceded the better-known [Industrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_revolution "Industrial revolution") and commercial revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.

### Cultural references

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Cultural references")]

Leibniz still receives popular attention. The [Google Doodle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Doodle "Google Doodle") for 1 July 2018 celebrated Leibniz's 372nd birthday.[[205]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-207)[[206]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-208)[[207]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-209) Using a [quill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quill "Quill"), his hand is shown writing "Google" in binary [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") code.

One of the earliest popular but indirect expositions of Leibniz was [Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire "Voltaire")'s satire _[Candide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide "Candide")_, published in 1759. Leibniz was lampooned as Professor Pangloss, described as "the greatest philosopher of the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire")".

Leibniz also appears as one of the main historical figures in [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson "Neal Stephenson")'s series of novels _[The Baroque Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Baroque\_Cycle "The Baroque Cycle")_. Stephenson credits readings and discussions concerning Leibniz for inspiring him to write the series.[[208]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-210)

Leibniz also stars in Adam Ehrlich Sachs's novel _The Organs of Sense_.

The German biscuit [Choco Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choco_Leibniz "Choco Leibniz") is named after Leibniz, a famous resident of [Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover "Hanover") where the manufacturer [Bahlsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahlsen "Bahlsen") is based.

Writings and publication

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, c. 1710

Leibniz mainly wrote in three languages: scholastic [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin"), French and German. During his lifetime, he published many pamphlets and scholarly articles, but only two "philosophical" books, the _Combinatorial Art_ and the _[Théodicée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odic%C3%A9e "Théodicée")_. (He published numerous pamphlets, often anonymous, on behalf of the House of [Brunswick-Lüneburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg "Brunswick-Lüneburg"), most notably the _De jure suprematum_ a major consideration of the nature of [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty "Sovereignty").) One substantial book appeared posthumously, his _[Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouveaux\_essais\_sur\_l%27entendement\_humain "Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain")_, which Leibniz had withheld from publication after the death of [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke"). Only in 1895, when Bodemann completed his catalogue of Leibniz's manuscripts and correspondence, did the enormous extent of Leibniz's _[Nachlass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachlass "Nachlass")_ become clear: about 15,000 letters to more than 1000 recipients plus more than 40,000 other items. Moreover, quite a few of these letters are of essay length. Much of his vast correspondence, especially the letters dated after 1700, remains unpublished, and much of what is published has appeared only in recent decades. The more than 67,000 records of the [Leibniz Edition's Catalogue](https://leibniz-katalog.bbaw.de/en) cover almost all of his known writings and the letters from him and to him. The amount, variety, and disorder of Leibniz's writings are a predictable result of a situation he described in a letter as follows:

> I cannot tell you how extraordinarily distracted and spread out I am. I am trying to find various things in the archives; I look at old papers and hunt up unpublished documents. From these I hope to shed some light on the history of the [House of] Brunswick. I receive and answer a huge number of letters. At the same time, I have so many mathematical results, philosophical thoughts, and other literary innovations that should not be allowed to vanish that I often do not know where to begin.[[209]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-211)

The extant parts of the critical edition[[210]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz#cite_note-ce-212) of Leibniz's writings are organized as follows:

*   Series 1. _Political, Historical, and General Correspondence_. 25 vols., 1666–1706.
*   Series 2. _Philosophical Correspondence_. 3 vols., 1663–1700.
*   Series 3. _Mathematical, Scientific, and Technical Correspondence_. 8 vols., 1672–1698.
*   Series 4. _[Political Writings](https://leibniz-potsdam.bbaw.de/)_. 9 vols., 1667–1702.
*   Series 5. _[Historical and Linguistic Writings](https://leibniz-potsdam.bbaw.de/)_. In preparation.
*   Series 6. _Philosophical Writings_. 7 vols., 1663–1690, and _Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain_.
*   Series 7. _Mathematical Writings_. 6 vols., 1672–1676.
*   Series 8. _Scientific, Medical, and Technical Writings_. 1 vol., 1668–1676.

The systematic cataloguing of all of Leibniz's _Nachlass_ began in 1901. It was hampered by two world wars and then by decades of German division into two states, separating scholars and scattering portions of his literary estates. The ambitious project has had to deal with writings in seven languages, contained in some 200,000 written and printed pages. In 1985 it was reorganized and included in a joint program of German federal and state (_Länder_) academies. Since then the branches in [Potsdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam "Potsdam"), [Münster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnster "Münster"), [Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover "Hanover") and Berlin have jointly published 57 volumes of the critical edition, with an average of 870 pages, and prepared index and [concordance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(publishing) "Concordance (publishing)") works.

The answer is unknowable, but it may not be unreasonable to see him, at least in theological terms, as essentially a deist. He is a determinist: there are no miracles (the events so called being merely instances of infrequently occurring natural laws); Christ has no real role in the system; we live forever, and hence we carry on after our deaths, but then everything—every individual substance—carries on forever. Nonetheless, Leibniz is a theist. His system is generated from, and needs, the postulate of a creative god. In fact, though, despite Leibniz's protestations, his God is more the architect and engineer of the vast complex world-system than the embodiment of love of Christian orthodoxy.

In advancing his system of mechanics, Newton claimed that collisions of celestial objects would cause a loss of energy that would require God to intervene from time to time to maintain order in the solar system (Vailati 1997, 37–42). In criticizing this implication, Leibniz remarks: "Sir Isaac Newton and his followers have also a very odd opinion concerning the work of God. According to their doctrine, God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time; otherwise it would cease to move." (Leibniz 1715, 675) Leibniz argues that any scientific theory that relies on God to perform miracles after He had first made the universe indicates that God lacked sufficient foresight or power to establish adequate natural laws in the first place. In defense of Newton's theism, Clarke is unapologetic: "'tis not a diminution but the true glory of his workmanship that nothing is done without his continual government and inspection"' (Leibniz 1715, 676–677). Clarke is believed to have consulted closely with Newton on how to respond to Leibniz. He asserts that Leibniz's deism leads to "the notion of materialism and fate" (1715, 677), because it excludes God from the daily workings of nature.

Consistent with the liberal views of the Enlightenment, Leibniz was an optimist with respect to human reasoning and scientific progress (Popper 1963, p. 69). Although he was a great reader and admirer of Spinoza, Leibniz, being a confirmed deist, rejected emphatically Spinoza's pantheism: God and nature, for Leibniz, were not simply two different "labels" for the same "thing".
