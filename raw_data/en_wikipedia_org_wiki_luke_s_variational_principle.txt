This principle is named after J.C. Luke, who published it in 1967.

[ 1 ] This variational principle is for incompressible and inviscid potential flows , and is used to derive approximate wave models like the mild-slope equation , [ 2 ] or using the averaged Lagrangian approach for wave propagation in inhomogeneous media.

[ 3 ] Luke's Lagrangian formulation can also be recast into a Hamiltonian formulation in terms of the surface elevation and velocity potential at the free surface.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] This is often used when modelling the spectral density evolution of the free-surface in a sea state , sometimes called wave turbulence .

Both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations can be extended to include surface tension effects, and by using Clebsch potentials to include vorticity .

[ 1 ] Luke's Lagrangian [ edit ] Luke's Lagrangian formulation is for non-linear surface gravity waves on an— incompressible , irrotational and inviscid — potential flow .

The relevant ingredients, needed in order to describe this flow, are: Φ( x , z , t ) is the velocity potential , ρ is the fluid density , g is the acceleration by the Earth's gravity , x is the horizontal coordinate vector with components x and y , x and y are the horizontal coordinates, z is the vertical coordinate, t is time, and ∇ is the horizontal gradient operator, so ∇Φ is the horizontal flow velocity consisting of ∂Φ/∂ x and ∂Φ/∂ y , V ( t ) is the time-dependent fluid domain with free surface.

The Lagrangian L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} , as given by Luke, is: L = − − ∫ ∫ t 0 t 1 { ∭ ∭ V ( t ) ρ ρ [ ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ t + 1 2 | ∇ ∇ Φ Φ | 2 + 1 2 ( ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z ) 2 + g z ] d x d y d z } d t .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}=-\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\left\{\iiint _{V(t)}\rho \left[{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+{\frac {1}{2}}\left|{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \right|^{2}+{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)^{2}+g\,z\right]\,\mathrm {d} x\;\mathrm {d} y\;\mathrm {d} z\right\}\mathrm {d} t.} From Bernoulli's principle , this Lagrangian can be seen to be the integral of the fluid pressure over the whole time-dependent fluid domain V ( t ) . This is in agreement with the variational principles for inviscid flow without a free surface, found by Harry Bateman .

[ 7 ] Variation with respect to the velocity potential Φ( x , z , t ) and free-moving surfaces like z = η ( x , t ) results in the Laplace equation for the potential in the fluid interior and all required boundary conditions : kinematic boundary conditions on all fluid boundaries and dynamic boundary conditions on free surfaces.

[ 8 ] This may also include moving wavemaker walls and ship motion.

For the case of a horizontally unbounded domain with the free fluid surface at z = η ( x , t ) and a fixed bed at z = − h ( x ) , Luke's variational principle results in the Lagrangian: L = − − ∫ ∫ t 0 t 1 ∬ ∬ { ∫ ∫ − − h ( x ) η η ( x , t ) ρ ρ [ ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ t + 1 2 | ∇ ∇ Φ Φ | 2 + 1 2 ( ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z ) 2 ] d z + 1 2 ρ ρ g η η 2 } d x d t .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}=-\,\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\iint \left\{\int _{-h({\boldsymbol {x}})}^{\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}\rho \,\left[{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\left|{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \right|^{2}+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)^{2}\right]\;\mathrm {d} z\;+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,g\,\eta ^{2}\right\}\;\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {x}}\;\mathrm {d} t.} The bed-level term proportional to h 2 in the potential energy has been neglected, since it is a constant and does not contribute in the variations. 
Below, Luke's variational principle is used to arrive at the flow equations for non-linear surface gravity waves on a potential flow.

Derivation of the flow equations resulting from Luke's variational principle [ edit ] The variation δ δ L = 0 {\displaystyle \delta {\mathcal {L}}=0} in the Lagrangian with respect to variations in the velocity potential Φ( x , z , t ), as well as with respect to the surface elevation η ( x , t ) , have to be zero. We consider both variations subsequently.

Variation with respect to the velocity potential [ edit ] Consider a small variation δ Φ in the velocity potential Φ .

[ 8 ] Then the resulting variation in the Lagrangian is: δ δ Φ Φ L = L ( Φ Φ + δ δ Φ Φ , η η ) − − L ( Φ Φ , η η ) = − − ∫ ∫ t 0 t 1 ∬ ∬ { ∫ ∫ − − h ( x ) η η ( x , t ) ρ ρ ( ∂ ∂ ( δ δ Φ Φ ) ∂ ∂ t + ∇ ∇ Φ Φ ⋅ ⋅ ∇ ∇ ( δ δ Φ Φ ) + ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z ∂ ∂ ( δ δ Φ Φ ) ∂ ∂ z ) d z } d x d t .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\delta _{\Phi }{\mathcal {L}}\,&=\,{\mathcal {L}}(\Phi +\delta \Phi ,\eta )\,-\,{\mathcal {L}}(\Phi ,\eta )\\&=\,-\,\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\iint \left\{\int _{-h({\boldsymbol {x}})}^{\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}\rho \,\left({\frac {\partial (\delta \Phi )}{\partial t}}+\,{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}(\delta \Phi )+\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\,{\frac {\partial (\delta \Phi )}{\partial z}}\,\right)\;\mathrm {d} z\,\right\}\;\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {x}}\;\mathrm {d} t.\end{aligned}}} Using Leibniz integral rule , this becomes, in case of constant density ρ : [ 8 ] δ δ Φ Φ L = − − ρ ρ ∫ ∫ t 0 t 1 ∬ ∬ { ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ t ∫ ∫ − − h ( x ) η η ( x , t ) δ δ Φ Φ d z + ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ ∫ ∫ − − h ( x ) η η ( x , t ) δ δ Φ Φ ∇ ∇ Φ Φ d z } d x d t + ρ ρ ∫ ∫ t 0 t 1 ∬ ∬ { ∫ ∫ − − h ( x ) η η ( x , t ) δ δ Φ Φ ( ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ ∇ ∇ Φ Φ + ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z 2 ) d z } d x d t + ρ ρ ∫ ∫ t 0 t 1 ∬ ∬ [ ( ∂ ∂ η η ∂ ∂ t + ∇ ∇ Φ Φ ⋅ ⋅ ∇ ∇ η η − − ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z ) δ δ Φ Φ ] z = η η ( x , t ) d x d t + ρ ρ ∫ ∫ t 0 t 1 ∬ ∬ [ ( ∇ ∇ Φ Φ ⋅ ⋅ ∇ ∇ h + ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z ) δ δ Φ Φ ] z = − − h ( x ) d x d t = 0.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\delta _{\Phi }{\mathcal {L}}\,=\,&-\,\rho \,\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\iint \left\{{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\int _{-h({\boldsymbol {x}})}^{\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}\delta \Phi \;\mathrm {d} z\;+\,{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\cdot \int _{-h({\boldsymbol {x}})}^{\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}\delta \Phi \,{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \;\mathrm {d} z\,\right\}\;\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {x}}\;\mathrm {d} t\\&+\,\rho \,\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\iint \left\{\int _{-h({\boldsymbol {x}})}^{\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}\delta \Phi \;\left({\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \,+\,{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial z^{2}}}\right)\;\mathrm {d} z\,\right\}\;\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {x}}\;\mathrm {d} t\\&+\,\rho \,\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\iint \left[\left({\frac {\partial \eta }{\partial t}}\,+\,{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\eta \,-\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)\,\delta \Phi \right]_{z=\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}\;\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {x}}\;\mathrm {d} t\\&+\,\rho \,\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\iint \left[\left({\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}h\,+\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)\,\delta \Phi \right]_{z=-h({\boldsymbol {x}})}\;\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {x}}\;\mathrm {d} t\\=\,&0.\end{aligned}}} The first integral on the right-hand side integrates out to the boundaries, in x and t , of the integration domain and is zero since the variations δ Φ are taken to be zero at these boundaries. For variations δ Φ which are zero at the free surface and the bed, the second integral remains, which is only zero for arbitrary δ Φ in the fluid interior if there the Laplace equation holds: Δ Δ Φ Φ = 0 for − − h ( x ) < z < η η ( x , t ) , {\displaystyle \Delta \Phi \,=\,0\qquad {\text{ for }}-h({\boldsymbol {x}})\,<\,z\,<\,\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t),} with Δ = ∇ ⋅ ∇ + ∂ 2 /∂ z 2 the Laplace operator .

If variations δ Φ are considered which are only non-zero at the free surface, only the third integral remains, giving rise to the kinematic free-surface boundary condition: ∂ ∂ η η ∂ ∂ t + ∇ ∇ Φ Φ ⋅ ⋅ ∇ ∇ η η − − ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z = 0.

at z = η η ( x , t ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \eta }{\partial t}}\,+\,{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\eta \,-\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\,=\,0.\qquad {\text{ at }}z\,=\,\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t).} Similarly, variations δ Φ only non-zero at the bottom z = − h result in the kinematic bed condition: ∇ ∇ Φ Φ ⋅ ⋅ ∇ ∇ h + ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z = 0 at z = − − h ( x ) .

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}h\,+\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\,=\,0\qquad {\text{ at }}z\,=\,-h({\boldsymbol {x}}).} Variation with respect to the surface elevation [ edit ] Considering the variation of the Lagrangian with respect to small changes δη gives: δ δ η η L = L ( Φ Φ , η η + δ δ η η ) − − L ( Φ Φ , η η ) = − − ∫ ∫ t 0 t 1 ∬ ∬ [ ρ ρ δ δ η η ( ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ t + 1 2 | ∇ ∇ Φ Φ | 2 + 1 2 ( ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z ) 2 + g η η ) ] z = η η ( x , t ) d x d t = 0.

{\displaystyle \delta _{\eta }{\mathcal {L}}\,=\,{\mathcal {L}}(\Phi ,\eta +\delta \eta )\,-\,{\mathcal {L}}(\Phi ,\eta )=\,-\,\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\iint \left[\rho \,\delta \eta \,\left({\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\,\left|{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \right|^{2}\,+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\,\left({\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)^{2}+\,g\,\eta \right)\,\right]_{z=\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}\;\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {x}}\;\mathrm {d} t\,=\,0.} This has to be zero for arbitrary δη , giving rise to the dynamic boundary condition at the free surface: ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ t + 1 2 | ∇ ∇ Φ Φ | 2 + 1 2 ( ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z ) 2 + g η η = 0 at z = η η ( x , t ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\,\left|{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \right|^{2}\,+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\,\left({\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)^{2}+\,g\,\eta \,=\,0\qquad {\text{ at }}z\,=\,\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t).} This is the Bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow, applied at the free surface, and with the pressure above the free surface being a constant — which constant pressure is taken equal to zero for simplicity.

Hamiltonian formulation [ edit ] The Hamiltonian structure of surface gravity waves on a potential flow was discovered by Vladimir E. Zakharov in 1968, and rediscovered independently by Bert Broer and John Miles : [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] ρ ρ ∂ ∂ η η ∂ ∂ t = + δ δ H δ δ φ φ , ρ ρ ∂ ∂ φ φ ∂ ∂ t = − − δ δ H δ δ η η , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\rho \,{\frac {\partial \eta }{\partial t}}\,&=\,+\,{\frac {\delta {\mathcal {H}}}{\delta \varphi }},\\\rho \,{\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial t}}\,&=\,-\,{\frac {\delta {\mathcal {H}}}{\delta \eta }},\end{aligned}}} where the surface elevation η and surface potential φ — which is the potential Φ at the free surface z = η ( x , t ) — are the canonical variables . The Hamiltonian H ( φ φ , η η ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}(\varphi ,\eta )} is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the fluid: H = ∬ ∬ { ∫ ∫ − − h ( x ) η η ( x , t ) 1 2 ρ ρ [ | ∇ ∇ Φ Φ | 2 + ( ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z ) 2 ] d z + 1 2 ρ ρ g η η 2 } d x .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}\,=\,\iint \left\{\int _{-h({\boldsymbol {x}})}^{\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}{\frac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,\left[\left|{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \right|^{2}\,+\,\left({\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)^{2}\right]\,\mathrm {d} z\,+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,g\,\eta ^{2}\right\}\;\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {x}}.} The additional constraint is that the flow in the fluid domain has to satisfy Laplace's equation with appropriate boundary condition at the bottom z = − h ( x ) and that the potential at the free surface z = η is equal to φ : δ δ H / δ δ Φ Φ = 0.

{\displaystyle \delta {\mathcal {H}}/\delta \Phi \,=\,0.} Relation with Lagrangian formulation [ edit ] The Hamiltonian formulation can be derived from Luke's Lagrangian description by using Leibniz integral rule on the integral of ∂Φ/∂ t : [ 6 ] L H = ∫ ∫ t 0 t 1 ∬ ∬ { φ φ ( x , t ) ∂ ∂ η η ( x , t ) ∂ ∂ t − − H ( φ φ , η η ; x , t ) } d x d t , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{H}=\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\iint \left\{\varphi ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)\,{\frac {\partial \eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}{\partial t}}\,-\,H(\varphi ,\eta ;{\boldsymbol {x}},t)\right\}\;\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {x}}\;\mathrm {d} t,} with φ φ ( x , t ) = Φ Φ ( x , η η ( x , t ) , t ) {\displaystyle \varphi ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)=\Phi ({\boldsymbol {x}},\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t),t)} the value of the velocity potential at the free surface, and H ( φ φ , η η ; x , t ) {\displaystyle H(\varphi ,\eta ;{\boldsymbol {x}},t)} the Hamiltonian density — sum of the kinetic and potential energy density — and related to the Hamiltonian as: H ( φ φ , η η ) = ∬ ∬ H ( φ φ , η η ; x , t ) d x .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}(\varphi ,\eta )\,=\,\iint H(\varphi ,\eta ;{\boldsymbol {x}},t)\;\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {x}}.} The Hamiltonian density is written in terms of the surface potential using Green's third identity on the kinetic energy: [ 9 ] H = 1 2 ρ ρ 1 + | ∇ ∇ η η | 2 φ φ ( D ( η η ) φ φ ) + 1 2 ρ ρ g η η 2 , {\displaystyle H\,=\,{\frac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,{\sqrt {1\,+\,\left|{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\eta \right|^{2}}}\;\;\varphi \,{\bigl (}D(\eta )\;\varphi {\bigr )}\,+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,g\,\eta ^{2},} where D ( η ) φ is equal to the normal derivative of ∂Φ/∂ n at the free surface. Because of the linearity of the Laplace equation — valid in the fluid interior and depending on the boundary condition at the bed z = − h and free surface z = η — the normal derivative ∂Φ/∂ n is a linear function of the surface potential φ , but depends non-linear on the surface elevation η . This is expressed by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator D ( η ) , acting linearly on φ .

The Hamiltonian density can also be written as: [ 6 ] H = 1 2 ρ ρ φ φ [ w ( 1 + | ∇ ∇ η η | 2 ) − − ∇ ∇ η η ⋅ ⋅ ∇ ∇ φ φ ] + 1 2 ρ ρ g η η 2 , {\displaystyle H\,=\,{\frac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,\varphi \,{\Bigl [}w\,\left(1\,+\,\left|{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\eta \right|^{2}\right)-\,{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\eta \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\,\varphi {\Bigr ]}\,+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,g\,\eta ^{2},} with w ( x , t ) = ∂Φ/∂ z the vertical velocity at the free surface z = η . Also w is a linear function of the surface potential φ through the Laplace equation, but w depends non-linear on the surface elevation η : [ 9 ] w = W ( η η ) φ φ , {\displaystyle w\,=\,W(\eta )\,\varphi ,} with W operating linear on φ , but being non-linear in η . As a result, the Hamiltonian is a quadratic functional of the surface potential φ . Also the potential energy part of the Hamiltonian is quadratic. The source of non-linearity in surface gravity waves is through the kinetic energy depending non-linear on the free surface shape η .

[ 9 ] Further ∇ φ is not to be mistaken for the horizontal velocity ∇Φ at the free surface: ∇ ∇ φ φ = ∇ ∇ Φ Φ ( x , η η ( x , t ) , t ) = [ ∇ ∇ Φ Φ + ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z ∇ ∇ η η ] z = η η ( x , t ) = [ ∇ ∇ Φ Φ ] z = η η ( x , t ) + w ∇ ∇ η η .

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\varphi \,=\,{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi {\bigl (}{\boldsymbol {x}},\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t),t{\bigr )}\,=\,\left[{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \,+\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\,{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\eta \right]_{z=\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}\,=\,{\Bigl [}{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi {\Bigr ]}_{z=\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}\,+\,w\,{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\eta .} Taking the variations of the Lagrangian L H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{H}} with respect to the canonical variables φ φ ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \varphi ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)} and η η ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)} gives: ρ ρ ∂ ∂ η η ∂ ∂ t = + δ δ H δ δ φ φ , ρ ρ ∂ ∂ φ φ ∂ ∂ t = − − δ δ H δ δ η η , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\rho \,{\frac {\partial \eta }{\partial t}}\,&=\,+\,{\frac {\delta {\mathcal {H}}}{\delta \varphi }},\\\rho \,{\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial t}}\,&=\,-\,{\frac {\delta {\mathcal {H}}}{\delta \eta }},\end{aligned}}} provided in the fluid interior Φ satisfies the Laplace equation, ΔΦ = 0 , as well as the bottom boundary condition at z = − h and Φ = φ at the free surface.
