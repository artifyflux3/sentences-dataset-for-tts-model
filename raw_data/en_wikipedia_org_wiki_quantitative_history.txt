It is a type of the social science history and has four major journals: Historical Methods (1967– ), [ 1 ] Journal of Interdisciplinary History (1968– ), [ 2 ] the Social Science History (1976– ), [ 3 ] and Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution (2010– ).

[ 4 ] Quantitative historians use databases as their main sources of information. Large quantities of political, economic and demographic data are available in print or manuscript format, such as census information on individuals, and election returns. Large quantities have been converted into computer databases. The largest repository presently is the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) of the University of Michigan , which provides access to an extensive collection of downloadable political and social data for the United States and the world. Quantitative historians use statistical methods to find patterns of human behavior covering all sectors of society, not just the elites who create documents preserved in traditional archive.

Data bases [ edit ] Content analysis is a technique borrowed from journalism research whereby text from newspapers, magazines or similar sources are coded numerically according to a standardized list of topics.

[ 5 ] Economic history [ edit ] Economic historians use major data sets, especially those collected by governments since the 1920s. Historians of slavery have used census data, sales receipts and price information to reconstruct the economic history of slavery.

Political history [ edit ] Quantifiers study topics like voting behavior of groups in elections, the roll call behavior of legislators, public opinion distribution, and the occurrence rate of wars and legislation.

Collective biography uses standardized information for a large group to deduce patterns of thought and behavior.

Social history [ edit ] Social historians using quantitative methods (sometimes termed "new social historians ", as they were "new" during the 1960s) use census data and other data sets to study entire populations. Topics include demographic issues such as population growth rates, rates of birth, death, marriage and disease, occupational and education distributions, genealogy and migrations and population changes.

A challenging technique is that of associating occurrences of the name of a given person ("nominal record linkage") whose information appears in multiple sources such as censuses, city directories, employment files and voting registration lists.

Cliodynamics is the application of scientific method to the study of history, combining insights from cultural evolution , macrosociology , and economic history / cliometrics to produce and analyse large quantitative datasets and identify general principles about the evolutionary dynamics and functioning of historical societies.

Topics [ edit ] During 2007–2008, the five most viewed articles in Social Science History were: [ 6 ] S. J. Kleinberg, "Children's and Mothers' Wage Labor in Three Eastern U.S. Cities, 1880-1920"  Mar 01, 2005; 29: 45-76.
