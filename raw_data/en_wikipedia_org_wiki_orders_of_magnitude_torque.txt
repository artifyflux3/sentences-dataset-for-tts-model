Examples [ edit ] Caption text Order of magnitude Value ( SI units) Value (imperial units) Item 10 1 1 N⋅m 0.73 lb⋅ft Torque when one end of a 1 m long moment arm is acted upon by a force of 1 N.

10 2 108 N⋅m to 149 N⋅m 80 lb⋅ft to 110 lb⋅ft Torque to which most lug nuts are tightened.

[ 1 ] 881 N⋅m 650 lb⋅ft Torque at the crankshaft of a Dodge Charger SRT HellCat.

[ 2 ] 10 4 13,000 N⋅m Example 2 MW wind turbine, generator side.

[ 3 ] 10 6 1,300,000 N⋅m Example 2 MW wind turbine, blade side.

[ 3 ] 7,000,000 N⋅m 5162935 lb⋅ft Output torque of the Wärtsilä RT-flex96C , [ 4 ] the largest piston engine in the world.
