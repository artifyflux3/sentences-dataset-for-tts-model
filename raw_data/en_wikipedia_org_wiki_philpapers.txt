of records 1.3 million + Links Website www .pdcnet .org /pri The Philosophy Research Index was established as an indexing database containing bibliographic information on philosophical publications in several western languages. It contained listings for a range of philosophical publications, including books, anthologies, scholarly journals, dissertations, and other documents.

[ 7 ] The first version of the database was launched by the Philosophy Documentation Center in 2011 [ 8 ] after a multi-year planning and development process, with technical support from Makrolog Content Management. It was established to build systematic coverage of philosophical literature in several languages in a manner that could be sustained for the long term. The database provides faceted searching, automatic translation and social networking functionality, and a visual time line for the display of search results, as well as OpenURL linking to fulltext resources. Philosophical topics covered include aesthetics , epistemology , ethics , history of philosophy , logic , metaphysics , philosophy of language , philosophy of religion , philosophy of science , political philosophy , and social philosophy .

In July 2014 PDC partnered with the PhilPapers Foundation. All data in the Philosophy Research Index was consolidated into the PhilPapers database. The Philosophy Research Index ceased be available as a separate resource once commitments to its customers was fulfilled.
