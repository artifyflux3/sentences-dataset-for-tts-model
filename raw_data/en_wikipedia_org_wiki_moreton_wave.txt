Described as a kind of solar " tsunami ", [ 1 ] they are generated by solar flares . They are named for American astronomer Gail Moreton , an observer at the Lockheed Solar Observatory in Burbank , and Harry E. Ramsey , an observer who spotted them in 1959 at The Sacramento Peak Observatory.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] He discovered them in time-lapse photography of the chromosphere in the light of the Balmer alpha transition .

There were few follow-up studies for decades. Then the 1995 launch of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) led to observation of coronal waves, which cause Moreton waves. Moreton waves were a research topic again. (SOHO's EIT instrument discovered another, different wave type called "EIT waves".) [ 5 ] The reality of Moreton waves (also known as fast-mode MHD waves) has also been confirmed by the two Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft. They observed a 100,000-km-high wave of hot plasma and magnetism, moving at 250 km/s, in conjunction with a big coronal mass ejection in February 2009.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Moreton measured the waves propagating at a speed of 500–1500 km/s.

[ 6 ] Yutaka Uchida interpreted Moreton waves as MHD fast mode shock waves propagating in the corona.

[ 8 ] He links them to type II radio bursts, which are radio-wave discharges created when coronal mass ejections accelerate shocks.

[ 9 ] Moreton waves can be observed primarily in the Hα band.
