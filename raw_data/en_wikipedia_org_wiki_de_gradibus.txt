De gradibus is the Latinized name of the book. An alternative name for the book was Quia Primos .

[ 1 ] In De Gradibus , Al-Kindi attempts to apply mathematics to pharmacology by quantifying the strength of drugs.  According to Prioreschi, this was the first attempt at serious quantification in medicine.

[ 2 ] During the Arabic-Latin translation movement of the 12th century , De Gradibus was translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona .

[ 1 ] Al-Kindi's mathematical reasoning was complex and hard to follow; Roger Bacon commented that his method of computing the strength of a drug was extremely difficult to use.
