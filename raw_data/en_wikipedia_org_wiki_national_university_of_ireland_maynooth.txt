Maynooth University was formerly known as National University of Ireland, Maynooth ( NUIM ; Irish : Ollscoil na hÉireann Mhá Nuad ).  It was Ireland's youngest university until Technological University Dublin was established in 2019, having been founded by the Universities Act, 1997, from the secular faculties of the now separate St Patrick's College, Maynooth , which was founded in 1795.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Maynooth is also the only university town in Ireland; all other Irish universities are based in cities.

South Campus, Maynooth The university consists of two connected campuses: an older southern campus, with 19th-century buildings, shared with St Patrick's College , and a modern northern campus, occupying c.

40 hectares (100 acres) .

[ 3 ] Over 16,000 students are enrolled in the university, employing over 1,000 staff from over 20 different countries.

[ 4 ] In 2009, Maynooth University was listed as a Top500 university in the Times Higher Education -QS World University Rankings .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] In 2008, it was named The Sunday Times 'University of the Year'.

In 2023, Times Higher Education (THE) listed Maynooth University as the Number 1 Young University in Ireland.

History [ edit ] Further information: St Patrick's College, Maynooth 18th and 19th centuries [ edit ] Sculpture "Waggle Dance" by Rachel Joynt and Remco de Fouw The university and St Patrick's College, Maynooth have a common history from 1795 to 1997. The college in Maynooth was established by the government as a college for Catholic lay and ecclesiastical students in 1795.

[ 7 ] The lay college was based from 1802 in Riverstown House on the south campus. With the opening of Clongowes Wood , the lay college which had lay trustees [ 8 ] was closed in 1817 [ 9 ] and it functioned solely as a Catholic seminary for almost 150 years. In 1876 the college became a constituent college of the Catholic University of Ireland , and later offered Royal University of Ireland degrees in arts and science. The Pontifical Charter was granted to the college in 1896.

20th and 21st centuries [ edit ] The college became a recognised constituent college of the National University of Ireland in 1910. From this time, arts and science degrees were awarded by the National University of Ireland, while the Pontifical University of Maynooth continued to confer its own theology degrees, as these had been prohibited in the Royal University of Ireland, and continued to the National University of Ireland (its successor) until 1997.

[ citation needed ] In 1966 the college again allowed the entry of lay students; this greatly expanded the college and essentially set the foundation stone for Maynooth University. In 1997 the Universities Act resulted in the transfer of the faculties of arts, Celtic studies, philosophy and science of the recognised college of St Patrick's College to the new university. The university has also expanded into finance and engineering since its creation in 1997. In 2007 the university added business studies, [ 10 ] followed by law in 2008.

[ 11 ] Eolas Building on the North Campus Any person who was a student at St Patrick's College, Maynooth, and was conferred with a National University of Ireland degree prior to the creation of the university, is legally considered a graduate of Maynooth University.

South Campus [ edit ] Maynooth Castle at the South Campus gates The South Campus houses the facilities of St. Patrick's College, as well as most of the administrative offices shared between college and university. A number of MU academic departments also have their offices on the South Campus including Law, Mathematics, Music, Geography, Economics and History. The main buildings, most of which were built in the 19th century, are the Aula Maxima ; St. Patrick's House (including the college chapel); the John Paul II Library (built in 1984).

The university chapel is located on the South Campus, just off St. Joseph's Square; masses and choir services are frequently held in the chapel, as is the traditional Christmas carol service. The South Campus also houses the National Science Museum and the Russell Library .
