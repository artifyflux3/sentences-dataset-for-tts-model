[ 1 ] Founded in the 9th century, Włocławek is located in the historical region of Kuyavia , and was its administrative center and main city in the Middle Ages . Nowadays, Włocławek is the third largest city of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship (after Bydgoszcz and Toruń ) and the main cultural and economic center of eastern Kuyavia. It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Włocławek , one of the oldest dioceses in Poland, since the 12th century, with the landmark Gothic Włocławek Cathedral listed as a Historic Monument of Poland .

[ 5 ] Poland's largest hydroelectric power plant is also located there.

[ 7 ] In the 10th century it became part of the emerging Polish state under the Piast dynasty .

[ 7 ] Already under the rule of Bolesław I the Brave it was one of Poland's most important administrative centers, as mentioned in the Gesta principum Polonorum chronicle from the 1110s, which also happens to be the oldest known mention of the city.

[ 7 ] The name is derived from the Old Polish male name Włodzisław, possibly the founder of Włocławek.

[ 8 ] In the mid-10th century, under Casimir I the Restorer , Włocławek was the seat of a castellany and the administrative center of Kuyavia .

[ 7 ] One of the earliest references to the town came from an assistant to the Archbishop of Gniezno who was noted as residing in the town in 1123. Later the Diocese of Włocławek ( Latin : Vladislaviensis ) of Kuyavia in 1148, notates its existence in a bull issued by Pope Eugene III , while mentioning the first bishop of Włocławek as Warner. Warner was followed by an Italian , Onoldius; the diocese was recorded as "Włocławek and Pomerania " ( Vladislaviensis et Pomeraniae ).

In the 12th century, there was a mint and a customs chamber, where tolls were collected from ships and boats sailing on the Vistula and Zgłowiączka rivers.

[ 8 ] A hospital was founded at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, [ 8 ] whereas the local school was first mentioned in 1215.

[ 9 ] Włocławek received its city rights in 1255. During the 14th and 15th centuries, the city was destroyed and captured several times by the Teutonic Knights and renamed it Leslau.

[ citation needed ] The Treaty of Thorn , signed in 1411, resulted in short-lived peace for the city, however, it prospered from its involvement in the ransoming of the captured Teutonic Knights which was payable in three instalments and proved to be a hardship on the Prussian faction. Włocławek was located within the Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship of the Greater Poland Province . There is a possibility that Nicolaus Copernicus , the later renowned astronomer, may have attended the local cathedral school in the late 15th century.

[ 10 ] Modern era [ edit ] Włocławek in 1896 The city's prosperity came from river transport of grain from Kuyavia, the collection of tolls on grain floated from the more southern part of Poland to the country's main port of Gdańsk , transport of timber from the Narew , Bug and upper Vistula rivers for export to Western Europe and brewing .

[ 11 ] This is mentioned in the 1595 poem Flis, to jest Spuszczanie statków Wisłą i inszymi rzekami do niej przypadającymi by Sebastian Klonowic .

[ 13 ] The city was ravaged by the Swedes during the Swedish invasion of Poland in 1657 and by the Russians during the Great Northern War in 1707.

[ 11 ] In 1790, Polish national hero Tadeusz Kościuszko stayed in Włocławek.

[ 14 ] After the Second Partition of Poland of 1793, Włocławek became part of Prussia . It was the site of Polish resistance during the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794, when Dionizy Mniewski [ pl ] sank Prussian ships with ammunition headed for besieged Warsaw .

[ 14 ] After the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807 it became part of the Polish short-lived Duchy of Warsaw . Subsequently, after the Congress of Vienna it became part of Congress Kingdom of Poland in the Russian Partition of Poland in 1815. Polish insurgents operated in the city and in its vicinity during the January Uprising of 1863–1864. The insurgents clashed with Russian troops in Włocławek on November 8, 1863, and February 17, 1864.

[ 15 ] The oldest Polish theological journal Ateneum Kapłańskie [ pl ] has been published in Włocławek since 1909.

[ 12 ] The city was again destroyed during the battles of German offensive during the First World War .

When Poland declared independence in 1918, local Poles disarmed the Germans and liberated the city.

[ 16 ] In 1920, Poles successfully defended the city against the invading Soviets during the Polish–Soviet War .

[ 17 ] World War II [ edit ] Memorials to the victims of the German occupation in Włocławek (examples): Memorial at the site where Germans imprisoned Polish teachers and priests in 1939 Memorial to murdered Polish railwaymen Memorial to murdered paper factory workers Memorial to murdered pottery factory workers During World War II , Włocławek was occupied by German troops, which entered the city on 14 September 1939.

Already in September 1939, Germans committed a massacre of a group of local Jews [ 18 ] and burned both synagogues. The Einsatzgruppe III entered the city between September 23 and October 5, 1939, and afterwards carried out mass arrests of local Poles in October and November as part of the Intelligenzaktion .

[ 19 ] Dozens of Catholic priests from Włocławek, including Auxiliary Bishop of Włocławek Michał Kozal , and lecturers and students of the seminary were arrested, and then deported in January 1940 to the Dachau concentration camp , where most of them were killed.

[ 12 ] [ 20 ] Rector of the local seminary Henryk Kaczorowski and two students Bronisław Kostkowski and Tadeusz Dulny are now considered three of the 108 Blessed Polish Martyrs of World War II by the Catholic Church .

[ 12 ] Local teachers were arrested in October 1939, and then deported to concentration camps and murdered.

[ 20 ] In late 1939, the SS and Selbstschutz burnt down the Grzywno district and murdered many of its inhabitants in the nearby village of Warząchewka Polska .

[ 21 ] Poles from Włocławek were also massacred in the nearby village of Pińczata .

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Arrested Polish teachers, landowners and priests from the Włocławek and Lipno counties were also imprisoned in Włocławek, and some were later also deported to concentration camps and murdered.

[ 23 ] Families of deported and murdered Poles, as well as the remaining residents of Grzywno were expelled to the so-called General Government in late 1939, [ 21 ] and in 1940 also owners of shops, workshops and bigger houses were expelled, so their properties could be handed over to German colonists as part of the Lebensraum policy.

[ 24 ] The Germans also robbed the precious historical collections of the Diocese of Włocławek and the Baroque Franciscan monastery [ 13 ] and closed down the cathedral.

[ 25 ] The city's central square, Plac Wolności ("Liberty Square"), was renamed Adolf-Hitler-Platz by the Germans.

[ 26 ] By the time the war ended, nearly the entire Jewish population of more than 10,000 had been murdered.

Monument of the Home Army , the leading Polish resistance movement in World War II Włocławek was captured on 20 January 1945 by Soviet troops of the 1st Belorussian Front during the Vistula–Oder Offensive . From February to April 1945, the Russians looted local factories and enterprises of grain (over 200 tons), coal (over 50 tons), fuel, machinery, cars, spirits, office equipment, which were taken en masse to the Soviet Union.

[ 27 ] Mass Soviet requisitions in the county caused food shortages in Włocławek.

[ 28 ] One third of the city was destroyed, but its factories and workshops were rebuilt by the Polish government in the following decades.

Recent period [ edit ] The most important industries in Włocławek today are chemical industry , production of furniture , and food processing . The dam which was constructed in 1969 regulates the water level of the Vistula river , forming Włocławek Reservoir . From 1975 to 1999, the city was the capital of the Włocławek Voivodeship .

The Catholic priest Fr. (now Blessed ), Jerzy Popiełuszko , who was associated with the workers' and trade union movement Solidarity , and who was also a member of the opposition to the Communist regime in Poland, was tortured and murdered by three Security Police officers, and was thrown into the Włocławek Reservoir, close to the city. His body was recovered from the reservoir on 30 October 1984.

From 2012 the city is part of the Special Economic Zone - Włocławek Economic Development Area – Industrial and Technological Park with tax-free areas and incentives for investors.

[ 29 ] The Jewish Community in Włocławek [ edit ] Memorial at the site of the former World War II ghetto The Jewish population increased from 218 (6.6%) in 1820 to 6,919 in 1910 (20.5%) and 13,500 in 1939. One of the founders of the Mizracḥi movement, rabbi Leib Kowalski (1895–1925), lived and worked in Włocławek. During the interbellum period, the town had several Jewish schools (primary and high schools), two yeshivas, and three Jewish sports clubs.

[ 30 ] With the beginning of the German occupation of Poland , Włocławek became the first town in Europe in which Jews were required to wear distinctive yellow badges .

[ 31 ] Murders of Jews began in 1939 and the Włocławek ghetto was created in November 1940. The Nazis deported 3,000 of Włocławek's Jews to ghettos and labor camps between December 1939 and June 1941. Some 2,000 Jews were deported to Łódź and then to the Chełmno extermination camp between 26 and 30 September 1941. The ghetto was burnt in late April 1942 after the remaining Jews were sent to Chelmno where they were immediately gassed.

[ 30 ] Most of the Jews sent to the Łódź Ghetto died of starvation or illness, and many were sent to Auschwitz from Łódź.

[ 32 ] After the war nearly 1000 Jews returned to Włocławek and re-established their community. However, Jews left after disputes within the community itself, and the desire of most Jews not to live under Communism, installed by the Soviets.

[ 33 ] By the late 1960s, the community had disappeared.

Today there is only very little, if any trace at all, of their once rich and lively community. There is a table for victims of Jewish ghetto in Włocławek's Rakutówek neighborhood (Polish Tablica Ofiar Getta we Włocławku) and Jewish Cemetery at Municipal/Communal Cemetery (Polish Cmentarz Komunalny we Włocławku).
