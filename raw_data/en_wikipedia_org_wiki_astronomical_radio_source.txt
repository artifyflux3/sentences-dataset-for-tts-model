From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

An **astronomical radio source** is an object in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") that emits strong [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave "Radio wave"). Radio emission comes from a wide variety of sources. Such objects are among the most extreme and energetic physical processes in the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe").

In 1932, American [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist") and [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio "Radio")[engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer "Engineer")[Karl Jansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Jansky "Karl Jansky") detected [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_waves "Radio waves") coming from an unknown source in the center of the Milky Way [galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy"). Jansky was studying the origins of radio frequency interference for [Bell Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Laboratories "Bell Laboratories"). He found "...a steady hiss type static of unknown origin", which eventually he concluded had an extraterrestrial origin. This was the first time that radio waves were detected from outer space.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-1) The first radio sky survey was conducted by [Grote Reber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grote_Reber "Grote Reber") and was completed in 1941. In the 1970s, some stars in the Milky Way were found to be radio emitters, one of the strongest being the unique [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star "Binary star")[MWC 349](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MWC_349 "MWC 349").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-2)

As the nearest star, the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") is the brightest radiation source in most frequencies, down to the radio spectrum at 300 MHz (1 m wavelength). When the Sun is quiet, the [galactic background noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_background_radiation "Cosmic background radiation") dominates at longer wavelengths. During [geomagnetic storms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm "Geomagnetic storm"), the Sun will dominate even at these low frequencies.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-3)

Magnetosphere of Jupiter

Oscillation of electrons trapped in the [magnetosphere of Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Jupiter "Magnetosphere of Jupiter") produce strong radio signals, particularly bright in the decimeter band.

The magnetosphere of Jupiter is responsible for intense episodes of radio emission from the planet's polar regions. Volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon [Io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon) "Io (moon)") injects gas into Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing a torus of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates [Alfvén waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfv%C3%A9n_wave "Alfvén wave") that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a [cyclotron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron "Cyclotron")[maser mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_maser "Astrophysical maser"), and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-4)

Jupiter's moon Ganymede

In 2021 news outlets reported that scientists, with the [_Juno_ spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_spacecraft "Juno spacecraft") that orbits Jupiter since 2016, detected an [FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation "Frequency modulation") radio signal from the moon [Ganymede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(moon) "Ganymede (moon)") at a location where the planet's magnetic field lines connect with those of its moon. According to the reports these were caused by [cyclotron maser instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron_radiation "Cyclotron radiation") and were similar to both [WiFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiFi "WiFi")-signals and Jupiter's radio emissions.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-futurism-ganymede-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-6) A study about the radio emissions was published in September 2020[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-7) but did not describe them to be of FM nature or similar to WiFi signals.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]

### The Galactic Center

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomical_radio_source&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: The Galactic Center")]

The [center of the Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center "Galactic Center") was the first radio source to be detected. It contains a number of radio sources, including [Sagittarius A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A "Sagittarius A"), the compact region around the [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole "Supermassive black hole"), [Sagittarius A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A* "Sagittarius A*"), as well as the black hole itself. When flaring, the [accretion disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk "Accretion disk") around the supermassive black hole lights up, detectable in radio waves.

In the 2000s, three Galactic Center Radio Transients (GCRTs) were detected: GCRT J1746–2757, GCRT J1745–3009, and GCRT J1742–3001.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-ASKAP-J17-8) In addition, ASKAP J173608.2-321635, which was detected six times in 2020, may be a fourth GCRT.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-SA-20210907-9)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-ASKAP-J17-8)

Region around the Galactic Center
In 2021, astronomers reported the detection of peculiar, highly [circularly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_polarization "Circular polarization")[polarized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_in_astronomy "Polarization in astronomy") intermittent radio waves from near the Galactic Center whose [unidentified source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy%27s_object "Andy's object") could represent a new class of astronomical objects with a GCRT so far not "fully explain[ing] the observations".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-11)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-ASKAP-J17-8)

[Supernova remnants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_remnant "Supernova remnant") often show diffuse radio emission. Examples include [Cassiopeia A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_A "Cassiopeia A"), the brightest extrasolar radio source in the sky, and the [Crab Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_Nebula "Crab Nebula").

Schematic view of a pulsar. The sphere in the middle represents the neutron star, the curves indicate the magnetic field lines, the protruding cones represent the emission beams and the green line represents the axis on which the star rotates.

Supernovae sometimes leave behind dense spinning [neutron stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_stars "Neutron stars") called [pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar "Pulsar"). They emit jets of charged particles which emit [synchrotron radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron_radiation "Synchrotron radiation") in the radio spectrum. Examples include the [Crab Pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_Pulsar "Crab Pulsar"), the first pulsar to be discovered. Pulsars and [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar "Quasar") (dense central cores of extremely distant galaxies) were both discovered by radio astronomers. In 2003 astronomers using the [Parkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkes_Observatory "Parkes Observatory")[radio telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope "Radio telescope") discovered two pulsars orbiting each other, the first such system known.

#### Rotating Radio Transient (RRAT) Sources

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomical_radio_source&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Rotating Radio Transient (RRAT) Sources")]

[Rotating radio transients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_radio_transient "Rotating radio transient") (RRATs) are a type of neutron stars discovered in 2006 by a team led by [Maura McLaughlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maura_McLaughlin "Maura McLaughlin") from the [Jodrell Bank Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodrell_Bank_Observatory "Jodrell Bank Observatory") at the [University of Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manchester "University of Manchester") in the UK. RRATs are believed to produce radio emissions which are very difficult to locate, because of their transient nature.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-12) Early efforts have been able to detect radio emissions (sometimes called **RRAT flashes**)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-13) for less than one second a day, and, like with other single-burst signals, one must take great care to distinguish them from terrestrial radio interference. Distributing computing and the Astropulse algorithm may thus lend itself to further detection of RRATs.

### Star forming regions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomical_radio_source&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Star forming regions")]

Short [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_waves "Radio waves") are emitted from complex [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecules "Molecules") in dense clouds of [gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas") where [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") are giving birth.

[Spiral galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy "Spiral galaxy") contain clouds of [neutral hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_hydrogen "Neutral hydrogen") and [carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide") which emit radio waves. The radio frequencies of these two molecules were used to map a large portion of the Milky Way galaxy.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-14)

Many galaxies are strong radio emitters, called [radio galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_galaxy "Radio galaxy"). Some of the more notable are [Centaurus A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus_A "Centaurus A") and [Messier 87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87 "Messier 87").

[Quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar "Quasar") (short for "quasi-stellar radio source") were one of the first point-like radio sources to be discovered. Quasars' extreme [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift") led us to conclude that they are distant active galactic nuclei, believed to be powered by [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole"). [Active galactic nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Galactic_Nucleus "Active Galactic Nucleus") have jets of charged particles which emit [synchrotron radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron_radiation "Synchrotron radiation"). One example is [3C 273](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C_273 "3C 273"), the optically brightest quasar in the sky.

Merging [galaxy clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_groups_and_clusters "Galaxy groups and clusters") often show diffuse radio emission.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-15)

### Cosmic microwave background

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomical_radio_source&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Cosmic microwave background")]

The cosmic microwave background is [blackbody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbody "Blackbody")[background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_radiation "Background radiation") left over from the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") (the rapid expansion, roughly 13.8 billion years ago,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-16) that was the beginning of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe").

D. R. Lorimer and others analyzed archival survey data and found a 30-[jansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jansky "Jansky") dispersed burst, less than 5 milliseconds in duration, located 3° from the [Small Magellanic Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Magellanic_Cloud "Small Magellanic Cloud"). They reported that the burst properties argue against a physical association with our Galaxy or the Small Magellanic Cloud. In a recent paper, they argue that current models for the free electron content in the universe imply that the burst is less than 1 giga[parsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec "Parsec") distant. The fact that no further bursts were seen in 90 hours of additional observations implies that it was a singular event such as a supernova or coalescence (fusion) of relativistic objects.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-17) It is suggested that hundreds of similar events could occur every day and, if detected, could serve as cosmological probes. Radio pulsar surveys such as Astropulse-SETI@home offer one of the few opportunities to monitor the radio sky for impulsive burst-like events with millisecond durations.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-18) Because of the isolated nature of the observed phenomenon, the nature of the source remains speculative. Possibilities include a black hole-[neutron star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star") collision, a neutron star-neutron star collision, a black hole-black hole collision, or some phenomenon not yet considered.

In 2010 there was a new report of 16 similar pulses from the Parkes Telescope which were clearly of terrestrial origin,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-19) but in 2013 four pulse sources were identified that supported the likelihood of a genuine extragalactic pulsing population.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-20)

These pulses are known as _fast radio bursts_ (FRBs). The first observed burst has become known as the _Lorimer burst_. [Blitzars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzar "Blitzar") are one proposed explanation for them.

### Primordial black holes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomical_radio_source&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Primordial black holes")]

According to the Big Bang Model, during the first few moments after the Big Bang, pressure and temperature were extremely great. Under these conditions, simple fluctuations in the density of matter may have resulted in local regions dense enough to create black holes. Although most regions of high density would be quickly dispersed by the expansion of the universe, a primordial black hole would be stable, persisting to the present.

One goal of [Astropulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astropulse "Astropulse") is to detect postulated mini black holes that might be evaporating due to "[Hawking radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation "Hawking radiation")". Such mini black holes are postulated[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-21) to have been created during the Big Bang, unlike currently known black holes. [Martin Rees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Rees "Martin Rees") has theorized that a black hole, exploding via Hawking radiation, might produce a signal that's detectable in the radio. The Astropulse project hopes that this evaporation would produce radio waves that Astropulse can detect. The evaporation wouldn't create radio waves directly. Instead, it would create an expanding fireball of high-energy [gamma rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_rays "Gamma rays") and particles. This fireball would interact with the surrounding magnetic field, pushing it out and generating radio waves.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-22)

Previous searches by various "search for extraterrestrial intelligence" (SETI) projects, starting with [Project Ozma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Ozma "Project Ozma"), have looked for extraterrestrial communications in the form of narrow-band signals, analogous to our own radio stations. The [Astropulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astropulse "Astropulse") project argues that since we know nothing about how ET might communicate, this might be a bit closed-minded. Thus, the Astropulse Survey can be viewed[_[by whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] as complementary to the narrow-band SETI@home survey as a by-product of the search for physical phenomena.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Other undiscovered phenomena

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomical_radio_source&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Other undiscovered phenomena")]

Explaining their discovery in 2005 of a powerful bursting radio source, NRL astronomer Dr. Joseph Lazio stated:[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source#cite_note-23) "Amazingly, even though the sky is known to be full of transient objects emitting at X- and gamma-ray wavelengths, very little has been done to look for radio bursts, which are often easier for astronomical objects to produce." The use of coherent dedispersion algorithms and the computing power provided by the SETI network may lead to discovery of previously undiscovered phenomena.
