Their proof was published in 1956 by Olof Hanner . They provide a simpler way of proving the uniform convexity of L p spaces for p ∈ (1, +∞) than the approach proposed by James A. Clarkson in 1936.

Statement of the inequalities [ edit ] Let f , g ∈ L p ( E ), where E is any measure space . If p ∈ [1, 2], then ‖ ‖ f + g ‖ ‖ p p + ‖ ‖ f − − g ‖ ‖ p p ≥ ≥ ( ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ p + ‖ ‖ g ‖ ‖ p ) p + | ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ p − − ‖ ‖ g ‖ ‖ p | p .

{\displaystyle \|f+g\|_{p}^{p}+\|f-g\|_{p}^{p}\geq {\big (}\|f\|_{p}+\|g\|_{p}{\big )}^{p}+{\big |}\|f\|_{p}-\|g\|_{p}{\big |}^{p}.} The substitutions F = f + g and G = f − g yield the second of Hanner's inequalities: 2 p ( ‖ ‖ F ‖ ‖ p p + ‖ ‖ G ‖ ‖ p p ) ≥ ≥ ( ‖ ‖ F + G ‖ ‖ p + ‖ ‖ F − − G ‖ ‖ p ) p + | ‖ ‖ F + G ‖ ‖ p − − ‖ ‖ F − − G ‖ ‖ p | p .

{\displaystyle 2^{p}{\big (}\|F\|_{p}^{p}+\|G\|_{p}^{p}{\big )}\geq {\big (}\|F+G\|_{p}+\|F-G\|_{p}{\big )}^{p}+{\big |}\|F+G\|_{p}-\|F-G\|_{p}{\big |}^{p}.} For p ∈ [2, +∞) the inequalities are reversed (they remain non-strict).

Note that for p = 2 {\displaystyle p=2} the inequalities become equalities which are both the parallelogram rule .
