It recognizes and enhances outstanding achievements by women physicists in the early years of their careers.

[ 1 ] The prize has been awarded since 1986 and is named after Maria Goeppert-Mayer , Nobel laureate in 1963 with J. Hans D. Jensen and Eugene Paul Wigner . Goeppert-Mayer and Jensen were awarded their prize "for their discovery of the nuclear shell structure ". Goeppert-Mayer was the second woman to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics after Marie Curie .
