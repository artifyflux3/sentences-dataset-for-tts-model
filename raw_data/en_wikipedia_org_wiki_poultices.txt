Find sources: "Poultice" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( July 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Schoolgirls in Britain being shown how to make a poultice, 1942 A poultice or cataplasm , also called a fomentation , is a soft moist mass, often heated and medicated, that is applied to the skin to reduce inflammation , soothe pain , promote healing, or otherwise treat wounds or ailments. Soft materials like cereals are used as a base, to which agents intended to affect the body, transdermally , may be added. The preparation is usually spread on cloth, which is then applied to the body part to be treated. The cloth is used to keep the preparation in place, or additional bandaging to hold the poultice may be employed. Direct topical application (without cloths) is also used.

[ 1 ] Poultice may also refer to a porous solid, filled with a solvent used to remove stains from porous stone such as marble or granite .

The word poultice comes from the Greek word poltos transformed to the Latin : puls , pultes , ' porridge '.

( April 2025 ) Native Americans have thousands of plants for the making of poultices.

[ 2 ] Preparation and composition [ edit ] Some Native Americans used mashed pumpkin or devil's club as a poultice.

[ 3 ] In addition to bread and cereals, bran may also be used as a poultice because of its absorbent quality. It is packed into the wound and then covered with a piece of sacking or similar material before being bandaged onto the site of the wound.

There are also many commercial poultices that are ready-made. Some of these may be labeled as " drawing salves ".

Ash poultices can cause a chemical burn .

[ 4 ] Types [ edit ] Fomentations – heated poultices – may be used to promote blood circulation to an affected area; these may be unmedicated.

Cold poultices are sometimes used. An example is the use of cabbage leaves to reduce breast engorgement in breastfeeding mothers. The leaves are applied directly to the breast, often simply held in place by a bra. Evidence for effectiveness as a treatment is weak: cabbage poultices are about as effective as the frequent, unrestricted feeding of the infant; they have no effect on the rate of progression to mastitis .

[ 5 ] There is some slight evidence that cabbage poultices reduce the pain of engorgement.

[ 6 ] Linseed flax ( Linum usitatissimum ) may be used in a poultice for boils, inflammation and wounds.

Veterinary use [ edit ] For broader coverage of this topic, see Horse leg protection .

Poultices are used on horses to relieve inflammation. Usually applied to the lower legs, under a stable bandage , to focus treatment on the easily injured tendons in the area. Poultices are sometimes applied as a precautionary measure after the horse has worked hard, such as after racing , jumping , or cross-country riding , to forestall strains or stiffness. They may be used to treat abscesses , with the intention of drawing out pus from the wound.

Cooling poultices are sometimes used for show-jumpers and racehorses ; these may be cheaper and easier to administer than commercial cooling products. A poultice is applied to the horse's distal limbs after exercise, for 9–12 hours. The intended effect is to cool the legs over a long period of time, by dispersing heat from the limb through the action of evaporation. Commonly, the poultice is bandaged over, sometimes with materials such wet newspaper between the poultice and bandages; this greatly reduces evaporation and heat loss, rendering the poultice ineffective at cooling.
