For Darboux's theorem related to the intermediate value theorem, see Darboux's theorem (analysis) .

In differential geometry , a field in mathematics , Darboux's theorem is a theorem providing a normal form for special classes of differential 1-forms , partially generalizing the Frobenius integration theorem . It is named after Jean Gaston Darboux [ 1 ] who established it as the solution of the Pfaff problem.

[ 2 ] It is a foundational result in several fields, the chief among them being symplectic geometry . Indeed, one of its many consequences is that any two symplectic manifolds of the same dimension are locally symplectomorphic to one another. That is, every 2 n {\displaystyle 2n} -dimensional symplectic manifold can be made to look locally like the linear symplectic space C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} with its canonical symplectic form.

There is also an analogous consequence of the theorem applied to contact geometry .

Statement [ edit ] Suppose that θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } is a differential 1-form on an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold, such that d θ θ {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \theta } has constant rank p {\displaystyle p} . Then if θ θ ∧ ∧ ( d θ θ ) p = 0 {\displaystyle \theta \wedge \left(\mathrm {d} \theta \right)^{p}=0} everywhere, then there is a local system of coordinates ( x 1 , … … , x n − − p , y 1 , … … , y p ) {\displaystyle (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n-p},y_{1},\ldots ,y_{p})} in which θ θ = x 1 d y 1 + … … + x p d y p ; {\displaystyle \theta =x_{1}\,\mathrm {d} y_{1}+\ldots +x_{p}\,\mathrm {d} y_{p};} if θ θ ∧ ∧ ( d θ θ ) p ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \theta \wedge \left(\mathrm {d} \theta \right)^{p}\neq 0} everywhere, then there is a local system of coordinates ( x 1 , … … , x n − − p , y 1 , … … , y p ) {\displaystyle (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n-p},y_{1},\ldots ,y_{p})} in which θ θ = x 1 d y 1 + … … + x p d y p + d x p + 1 .

{\displaystyle \theta =x_{1}\,\mathrm {d} y_{1}+\ldots +x_{p}\,\mathrm {d} y_{p}+\mathrm {d} x_{p+1}.} Darboux's original proof used induction on p {\displaystyle p} and it can be equivalently presented in terms of distributions [ 3 ] or of differential ideals .

[ 4 ] Frobenius' theorem [ edit ] Darboux's theorem for p = 0 {\displaystyle p=0} ensures that any 1-form θ θ ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \theta \neq 0} such that θ θ ∧ ∧ d θ θ = 0 {\displaystyle \theta \wedge d\theta =0} can be written as θ θ = d x 1 {\displaystyle \theta =dx_{1}} in some coordinate system ( x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})} .

This recovers one of the formulation of Frobenius theorem in terms of differential forms: if I ⊂ ⊂ Ω Ω ∗ ∗ ( M ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}\subset \Omega ^{*}(M)} is the differential ideal generated by θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } , then θ θ ∧ ∧ d θ θ = 0 {\displaystyle \theta \wedge d\theta =0} implies the existence of a coordinate system ( x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})} where I ⊂ ⊂ Ω Ω ∗ ∗ ( M ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}\subset \Omega ^{*}(M)} is actually generated by d x 1 {\displaystyle dx_{1}} .

[ 4 ] Darboux's theorem for symplectic manifolds [ edit ] Suppose that ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } is a symplectic 2-form on an n = 2 m {\displaystyle n=2m} -dimensional manifold M {\displaystyle M} . In a neighborhood of each point p {\displaystyle p} of M {\displaystyle M} , by the Poincaré lemma , there is a 1-form θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } with d θ θ = ω ω {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \theta =\omega } . Moreover, θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } satisfies the first set of hypotheses in Darboux's theorem, and so locally there is a coordinate chart U {\displaystyle U} near p {\displaystyle p} in which θ θ = x 1 d y 1 + … … + x m d y m .

{\displaystyle \theta =x_{1}\,\mathrm {d} y_{1}+\ldots +x_{m}\,\mathrm {d} y_{m}.} Taking an exterior derivative now shows ω ω = d θ θ = d x 1 ∧ ∧ d y 1 + … … + d x m ∧ ∧ d y m .

{\displaystyle \omega =\mathrm {d} \theta =\mathrm {d} x_{1}\wedge \mathrm {d} y_{1}+\ldots +\mathrm {d} x_{m}\wedge \mathrm {d} y_{m}.} The chart U {\displaystyle U} is said to be a Darboux chart around p {\displaystyle p} .

[ 5 ] The manifold M {\displaystyle M} can be covered by such charts.

To state this differently, identify R 2 m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2m}} with C m {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{m}} by letting z j = x j + i y j {\displaystyle z_{j}=x_{j}+{\textit {i}}\,y_{j}} . If φ φ : U → → C n {\displaystyle \varphi :U\to \mathbb {C} ^{n}} is a Darboux chart, then ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } can be written as the pullback of the standard symplectic form ω ω 0 {\displaystyle \omega _{0}} on C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} : ω ω = φ φ ∗ ∗ ω ω 0 .

{\displaystyle \omega =\varphi ^{*}\omega _{0}.\,} A modern proof of this result, without employing Darboux's general statement on 1-forms, is done using Moser's trick .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Comparison with Riemannian geometry [ edit ] Darboux's theorem for symplectic manifolds implies that there are no local invariants in symplectic geometry: a Darboux basis can always be taken, valid near any given point. This is in marked contrast to the situation in Riemannian geometry where the curvature is a local invariant, an obstruction to the metric being locally a sum of squares of coordinate differentials.

The difference is that Darboux's theorem states that ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } can be made to take the standard form in an entire neighborhood around p {\displaystyle p} . In Riemannian geometry, the metric can always be made to take the standard form at any given point, but not always in a neighborhood around that point.

Darboux's theorem for contact manifolds [ edit ] Another particular case is recovered when n = 2 p + 1 {\displaystyle n=2p+1} ; if θ θ ∧ ∧ ( d θ θ ) p ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \theta \wedge \left(\mathrm {d} \theta \right)^{p}\neq 0} everywhere, then θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } is a contact form . A simpler proof can be given, as in the case of symplectic structures, by using Moser's trick .

[ 7 ] The Darboux-Weinstein theorem [ edit ] Alan Weinstein showed that the Darboux's theorem for sympletic manifolds can be strengthened to hold on a neighborhood of a submanifold : [ 8 ] Let M {\displaystyle M} be a smooth manifold endowed with two symplectic forms ω ω 1 {\displaystyle \omega _{1}} and ω ω 2 {\displaystyle \omega _{2}} , and let N ⊂ ⊂ M {\displaystyle N\subset M} be a closed submanifold. If ω ω 1 | N = ω ω 2 | N {\displaystyle \left.\omega _{1}\right|_{N}=\left.\omega _{2}\right|_{N}} , then there is a neighborhood U {\displaystyle U} of N {\displaystyle N} in M {\displaystyle M} and a diffeomorphism f : U → → U {\displaystyle f:U\to U} such that f ∗ ∗ ω ω 2 = ω ω 1 {\displaystyle f^{*}\omega _{2}=\omega _{1}} .

The standard Darboux theorem is recovered when N {\displaystyle N} is a point and ω ω 2 {\displaystyle \omega _{2}} is the standard symplectic structure on a coordinate chart.

This theorem also holds for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds .
