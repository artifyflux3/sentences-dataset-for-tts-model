Calculus (from Latin calculus meaning ‘pebble’, plural calculī ) in its most general sense is any method or system of calculation .

Calculus may refer to: Biology [ edit ] Calculus (spider) , a genus of the family Oonopidae Caseolus calculus , a genus and species of small land snails Medicine [ edit ] Calculus (dental) , deposits of calcium phosphate salts on teeth, also known as tartar Calculus (medicine) , a stone formed in the body such as a gall stone or kidney stone Mathematics [ edit ] Infinitesimal calculus (or simply calculus ), which investigates motion and rates of change Differential calculus Integral calculus Non-standard calculus , an approach to infinitesimal calculus using Robinson's infinitesimals Calculus of sums and differences ( difference operator ), also called the finite-difference calculus, a discrete analogue of "calculus" Functional calculus , a way to apply various types of functions to operators Schubert calculus , a branch of algebraic geometry Tensor calculus (also called tensor analysis), a generalization of vector calculus that encompasses tensor fields Vector calculus (also called vector analysis), comprising specialized notations for multivariable analysis of vectors in an inner-product space Matrix calculus , a specialized notation for multivariable calculus over spaces of matrices Numerical calculus (also called numerical analysis), the study of numerical approximations Umbral calculus , the combinatorics of certain operations on polynomials The calculus of variations , a field of study that deals with extremizing functionals Itô calculus An extension of calculus to stochastic processes.

Logic [ edit ] Logical calculus , a formal system that defines a language and rules to derive an expression from premises Propositional calculus , specifies the rules of inference governing the logic of propositions Predicate calculus , specifies the rules of inference governing the logic of predicates Proof calculus , a framework for expressing systems of logical inference Sequent calculus , a proof calculus for first-order logic Cirquent calculus , a proof calculus based on graph-style structures called cirquents Situation calculus , a framework for describing relations within a dynamic system Event calculus , a model for reasoning about events and their effects Fluent calculus , a model for describing relations within a dynamic system Calculus of relations , the manipulation of binary relations with the algebra of sets, composition of relations, and transpose relations Epsilon calculus , a logical language which replaces quantifiers with the epsilon operator Modal μ-calculus , a common temporal logic used by formal verification methods such as model checking Physics [ edit ] Bondi k -calculus , a method used in relativity theory Jones calculus , used in optics to describe polarized light Mueller calculus , used in optics to handle Stokes vectors, which describe the polarization of incoherent light Operational calculus , used to solve differential equations arising in electronics Formal language [ edit ] Lambda calculus , a formulation of the theory of reflexive functions that has deep connections to computational theory Kappa calculus , a reformulation of the first-order fragment of typed lambda calculus Rho calculus, introduced as a general means to uniformly integrate rewriting into lambda calculus Process calculus , a set of approaches to formulating formal models of concurrent systems Ambient calculus , a family of models for concurrent systems based on the concept of agent mobility Join calculus , a theoretical model for the design of distributed programming languages π-calculus , a formulation of the theory of concurrent, communicating processes Relational calculus , a calculus for the relational data model Domain relational calculus Tuple calculus Refinement calculus , a way of refining models of programs into efficient programs Other meanings [ edit ] a calculus (pl.
