A salient , panhandle , or bootheel is an elongated protrusion of a geopolitical entity, such as a subnational entity or a sovereign state .

While similar to a peninsula in shape, a salient is most often not surrounded by water on three sides. Instead, it has a land border on at least two sides and extends from the larger geographical body of the administrative unit.

In American English , the term panhandle is often used to describe a relatively long and narrow salient, such as the westernmost extensions of Florida and Oklahoma , or the northernmost portion of Idaho . Another term is bootheel , used for the Missouri Bootheel and New Mexico Bootheel areas.

Origin [ edit ] The term salient is derived from military salients . The term "panhandle" derives from the analogous part of a cooking pan , and its use is generally confined to North America.

The salient shape can be the result of arbitrarily drawn international or subnational boundaries, which serve to separate culturally unified peoples.

[ 1 ] These occurred, for instance, during European colonialisation when colonial powers competed for Africa and the Western Hemisphere , after which post-colonial borders became based on colonial divisions.

[ 2 ] In many cases these salients correspond to routes of expansion or bases for such expansion, as in Namibia and Mozambique.

[ 3 ] Other modern salients originally served to provide barriers against other colonial powers, as with Britain against Tsarist Russia in Central Asia .

[ 1 ] Salients may also arise when a national government shifts territory between subnational entities for internal political reasons, as with West Virginia's eastern panhandle during the Civil War .

[ 4 ] This also occurred with peripheral Tibetan -inhabited regions in Maoist China, which were split between provinces and from the Tibet Autonomous Region .

[ 5 ] The location of administrative borders can also take into account other considerations such as economic ties , [ 6 ] strategic needs, [ 7 ] history or topography . Even in these situations, however, salients frequently fail to follow clear and logical criteria, as seen with the partition of India and the resultant northeastern salient . Upon partition numerous majority-Muslim areas remained within Hindu India, and some non-Muslim-majority areas within the exclave of East Pakistan .
