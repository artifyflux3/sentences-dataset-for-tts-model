[ 1 ] It is a generalization of the circular cone and a special case of the generalized cone .

The term might refer to the solid figure bounded by the base or only to the lateral conic surface , a quadric called conical quadric or quadratic cone .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system , an elliptic cone is the locus of an equation of the form: [ 4 ] x 2 a 2 + y 2 b 2 = z 2 .

{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}+{\frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}=z^{2}.} It is an affine image of the unit right circular cone with equation x 2 + y 2 = z 2 .

{\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}\ .} From the fact that the affine image of a conic section is a conic section of the same type (ellipse, parabola , etc.), any plane section of an elliptic cone is a conic section (see Circular section#Elliptic cone ).

The intersection curve of an elliptic cone with a concentric sphere is a spherical conic .
