**William G. McCallum** (born 1956 in [Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney "Sydney"), Australia)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._McCallum#cite_note-brief-1) is a retired University Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at the [University of Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona "University of Arizona"). His professional interests include [arithmetical algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetical_algebraic_geometry "Arithmetical algebraic geometry") and [mathematics education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_education "Mathematics education").

Education and professional work
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_G._McCallum&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Education and professional work")]

McCallum received a bachelor's degree from the [University of New South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_South_Wales "University of New South Wales") in 1977,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._McCallum#cite_note-cv-2) and his Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") in 1984, under the supervision of [Barry Mazur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Mazur "Barry Mazur").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._McCallum#cite_note-3)

He was a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley") and the [Mathematical Sciences Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Sciences_Research_Institute "Mathematical Sciences Research Institute") in Berkeley before joining the [University of Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona "University of Arizona") in 1987.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._McCallum#cite_note-brief-1) He became University Distinguished Professor from 2006 until his retirement in 2018, and headed the Department of Mathematics from 2009 to 2013.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._McCallum#cite_note-cv-2)

McCallum helped found the Harvard Calculus Consortium with other mathematicians including [Andrew M. Gleason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_M._Gleason "Andrew M. Gleason") and [Deborah Hughes Hallett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hughes_Hallett "Deborah Hughes Hallett").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._McCallum#cite_note-adps-4) He led the development of the [Common Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core "Common Core") standards for mathematics from 2009 until the standards were first released in 2010.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._McCallum#cite_note-5) In 2014 he founded a company, eventually known as Illustrative Mathematics, to develop teaching resources for the mathematics standards that he helped develop.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._McCallum#cite_note-6)

Selected honors and awards
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_G._McCallum&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Selected honors and awards")]

In 2012, McCallum became a [Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow "Fellow") of the [American Mathematical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mathematical_Society "American Mathematical Society").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._McCallum#cite_note-7) In the same year he received the inaugural [Mary P. Dolciani Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_P._Dolciani_Award "Mary P. Dolciani Award") for distinguished contributions to mathematical education, administered by the [Mathematical Association of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Association_of_America "Mathematical Association of America"),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._McCallum#cite_note-8) and the [AMS Distinguished Public Service Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMS_Distinguished_Public_Service_Award "AMS Distinguished Public Service Award") of the [American Mathematical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mathematical_Society "American Mathematical Society"), "for his energetic and effective efforts in promoting improvements to mathematics education"[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._McCallum#cite_note-adps-4)
