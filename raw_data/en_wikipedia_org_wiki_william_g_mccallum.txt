McCallum William G. McCallum (born 1956 in Sydney , Australia) [ 1 ] is a retired University Distinguished Professor of Mathematics  at the University of Arizona . His professional interests include arithmetical algebraic geometry and mathematics education .

Education and professional work [ edit ] McCallum received a bachelor's degree from the University of New South Wales in 1977, [ 2 ] and his Ph.D. in Mathematics from Harvard University in 1984, under the supervision of Barry Mazur .

[ 3 ] He was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley and the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley before joining the University of Arizona in 1987.

[ 1 ] He became University Distinguished Professor from 2006 until his retirement in 2018, and headed the Department of Mathematics from 2009 to 2013.

[ 2 ] McCallum helped found the Harvard Calculus Consortium with other mathematicians including Andrew M. Gleason and Deborah Hughes Hallett .

[ 4 ] He led the development of the Common Core standards for mathematics from 2009 until the standards were first released in 2010.

[ 5 ] In 2014 he founded a company, eventually known as Illustrative Mathematics, to develop teaching resources for the mathematics standards that he helped develop.

[ 6 ] Selected honors and awards [ edit ] In 2012, McCallum became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 7 ] In the same year he received the inaugural Mary P. Dolciani Award for distinguished contributions to mathematical education, administered by the Mathematical Association of America , [ 8 ] and the AMS Distinguished Public Service Award of the American Mathematical Society , "for his energetic and effective efforts in promoting improvements to mathematics education" [ 4 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b Brief biography for William G.
