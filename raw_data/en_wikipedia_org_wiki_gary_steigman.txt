[ 1 ] [ 2 ] After graduating in 1961 with a bachelor's degree in physics from the City College of New York , he received in 1968 his PhD, under the supervision of Malvin Ruderman , from New York University . Steigman's doctoral dissertation showed that the hypothesis of cosmological matter–antimatter symmetry is false and in our universe there be must be a significant excess of baryons over antibaryons. This work was published in 1969 in the journal Nature [ 3 ] and was followed in 1976 with a highly cited article in the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics .

[ 4 ] He became in 1968 a visiting fellow at the University of Cambridge's Institute of Theoretical Astronomy (now the Institute of Astronomy) and in 1970 a research fellow at Caltech.

Beginning in 1972 he spent 23 summers at the Aspen Center for Physics , where he served as a trustee in 1978–83, a member of the advisory board in 1983–98, and a longtime organizer of astrophysics workshops.

[ 2 ] Steigman became in 1972 a faculty member at Yale University, in 1978 a member of the Bartol Research Institute at the University of Delaware, and in 1986 a full professor at Ohio State University, [ 1 ] where he retired in 2012 as professor emeritus.

[ 5 ] He was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society in 1991.

In 1977 Steigman, with James E. Gunn and David N. Schramm , published a paper that, using facts about 4 He abundances and primordial nucleosynthesis, established a new limit on the number of neutrino species; their results showed that "the total number of types of heavy leptons must be less than or equal to 5." [ 6 ] This demonstration was one of the first to constrain particle physics by means of facts about cosmology.

[ 2 ] Steigman and Schramm received first prize in the 1980 Gravity Research Foundation essay competition for their paper which analyzed a hypothetical universe dominated by massive neutrinos. Their essay was among the earliest proposals for a universe dominated by non-baryonic particles. With David Schramm, Michael Turner , Keith Olive , and Terrence P. Walker, Gary Steigman derived accurate estimates of the baryon density of the universe and constrained particle properties. In the 1980s and 1990s they wrote a series of highly cited papers predicting a precise value for the baryon density of the universe. Their prediction was confirmed by CMB measurements.

[ 2 ] In 1984 Steigman, with Michael Turner and Lawrence Krauss , suggested that many problems in cosmology could be solved by re-introducing the idea of a nonzero cosmological constant .

[ 1 ] He was recruited to Ohio State in 1986 to found a cosmology center, which would include both astronomers and physicists. Around the same time, he began a romantic, interhemispheric relationship with a Brazilian astronomer, Sueli Viegas, from the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of São Paulo , whom he had met at a conference in Rio de Janeiro. They married in 2004, after Dr. Viegas had retired from São Paulo. Besides Dr. Viegas, Dr. Steigman is survived by a stepdaughter, Cibele Aldrovandi; a stepson, Leonardo Aldrovandi; and two nieces: Jill Bayor and Robin Coe. A previous marriage had ended in divorce.
