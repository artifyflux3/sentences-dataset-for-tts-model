An example of modern globalizing technology in the beginning of the 20th century.

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the broad, interdisciplinary subject of globalization: Globalization (or globalisation ) – processes of international integration arising from the interchange of world views , products, ideas, and other aspects of culture .

[ 1 ] Advances in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, including the rise of the Internet , are major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities.

[ 2 ] Globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization, economics , sociocultural resources, and the natural environment .

Global studies [ edit ] See also: International studies World citizen badge Global studies – interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary academic study of globalizing forces and trends. Global studies may include the investigation of one or more aspects of globalization, but tend to concentrate on how globalizing trends are redefining the relationships between states, organizations, societies, communities, and individuals, creating new challenges that cannot be solved by nations or markets alone.

[ 3 ] Study of the factors contributing to globalization may originate in many academic concentrations, such as political science , economics , and sociology .

History [ edit ] Animated map showing the development of colonial empires from 1492 to present History of globalization – generally broken-down into three periods: Archaic , Proto-globalization , and Modern.

The Archaic period is defined as events and developments from the time of the earliest civilizations until roughly 1600.

The period of Proto-globalization roughly spans the years between 1600 and 1800. It was largely shaped in this era by the operations of colonialism .

The Modern period of globalization covers from the 19th century until the present time.

Imperialism and industrialization have figured largely in shaping modern globalizing forces and trends.

Globalization concepts [ edit ] Links below are to articles, unless otherwise specified.

Globalization-related theories [ edit ] Since globalization is not an independent phenomenon but is highly interrelated with world views, products, ideas, and other aspects of culture, explanations of why globalization occurs and what the effects of globalization are or can be expected are related to theories ranging from economic development to revolutionary socialism .

Pyramid of Capitalist System , 1911 Industrial Worker publication advocating industrial unionism. It also shows the critique of capitalism.

This global workforce has implications ranging from immigration policy to basic human and labor rights .

In the age of globalization, few absolutely natural environments remain.

Human challenges to the natural environment, such as climate change , cross-boundary water and air pollution , over-fishing of the ocean, and the spread of invasive species require at least transnational and, often, global solutions.
