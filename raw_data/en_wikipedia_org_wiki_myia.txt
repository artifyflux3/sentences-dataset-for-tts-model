Myia ( / ˈ m aɪ .

ə / ; Ancient Greek : Μυῖα , literally "Fly"; fl. c. 500 BC) was a Pythagorean philosopher and, according to later tradition, one of the daughters of Theano and Pythagoras .

[ 1 ] Life [ edit ] Myia was married to Milo of Croton , the famous athlete. She was a choir leader as a girl, and as a woman she was noted for her exemplary religious behaviour.

[ 2 ] Lucian , in his In Praise of a Fly , states that he could say many things about Myia the Pythagorean were it not for the fact that her history is known to everyone.

[ 3 ] One letter attributed to Myia is still extant. It is spurious, and probably dates from the 3rd or 2nd century BC.

[ 4 ] The letter is addressed to a certain Phyllis, and discusses the importance of fulfilling the needs of a newborn baby according to the principle of harmony. According to the writer, a baby naturally desires moderation in all things, such as food, clothing, heating, etc., and a nurse of that baby must be moderate also.
