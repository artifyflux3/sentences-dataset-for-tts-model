| Created cardinal | 20 December 1448 by Pope Nicholas V |

**Nicholas of Cusa** (1401 – 11 August 1464), also referred to as **Nicholas of Kues** and **Nicolaus Cusanus** (), was a German [Catholic bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_bishop "Catholic bishop") and [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath "Polymath") active as a [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher"), [theologian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theologian "Theologian"), [jurist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist "Jurist"), mathematician, and astronomer. One of the first German proponents of [Renaissance humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism "Renaissance humanism"), he made spiritual and political contributions to European culture. A notable example of this is his mystical or spiritual writings on "learned ignorance," as well as his participation in power struggles between [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Curia "Roman Curia") and the German states of the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire").

As [papal legate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_legate "Papal legate") to Germany from 1446, he was appointed [cardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholicism) "Cardinal (Catholicism)") for his merits by [Pope Nicholas V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Nicholas_V "Pope Nicholas V") in 1448 and [Prince-Bishop of Brixen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishopric_of_Brixen "Bishopric of Brixen") two years later. In 1459, he became [vicar general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicar_general "Vicar general") in the [Papal States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States "Papal States").

Nicholas has remained an influential figure. In 2001, the sixth centennial of his birth was celebrated on four continents and commemorated by publications on his life and work.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-3)

Birthplace in Kues

Nicholas was born in [Kues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernkastel-Kues "Bernkastel-Kues") ([Latinized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinisation_of_names "Latinisation of names") as "Cusa") in southwestern Germany. He was the second of four children of Johan Krebs (or Cryfftz) and Katherina Roemer. His father was "a prosperous boat owner and ferryman."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-4) Nicholas entered the [Faculty of Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_of_Arts "Faculty of Arts") of the [Heidelberg University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg_University "Heidelberg University") in 1416 as "a cleric of the [Diocese of Trier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electorate_of_Trier "Electorate of Trier")," studying the [liberal arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education "Liberal arts education"). He seemed to have left Heidelberg soon afterwards, as he received his doctorate in [canon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law_(Catholic_Church) "Canon law (Catholic Church)") from the [University of Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Padua "University of Padua") in 1423. In Padua, he met the later cardinals [Julian Cesarini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Cesarini "Julian Cesarini") and [Domenico Capranica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domenico_Capranica "Domenico Capranica") and became friends with the mathematician [Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_dal_Pozzo_Toscanelli "Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli"). Afterwards, he entered the [University of Cologne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cologne "University of Cologne") in 1425 as "a doctor of canon law," which he appears to have both taught and practiced there. In Cologne, he made friends with the scholastic theologian [Heymeric de Campo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heymeric_de_Campo "Heymeric de Campo").

Following a brief period in Cologne, Nicholas returned to his hometown and became secretary to Otto of Ziegenhain, the [Prince-Archbishop of Trier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elector_of_Trier "Elector of Trier"). Otto appointed him [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(priest) "Canon (priest)") and [dean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(Christianity) "Dean (Christianity)") at the [stift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stift "Stift") of [Saint Florinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florinus_of_Rem%C3%BCs "Florinus of Remüs") in [Koblenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koblenz "Koblenz") affiliated with numerous [prebends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prebendary "Prebendary"). In 1427 he was sent to Rome as an episcopal delegate. The next year he travelled to [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris") to study the writings of [Ramon Llull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull "Ramon Llull"). At the same time he rejected a calling by the newly established [University of Leuven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_University_of_Leuven "Old University of Leuven"). He acquired great knowledge in the research of ancient and medieval [manuscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript "Manuscript") as well as in [textual criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism "Textual criticism") and the examination of [primary sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source "Primary source"). In 1433 he identified the _[Donation of Constantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation\_of\_Constantine "Donation of Constantine")_ as a fake, confirmed by [Lorenzo Valla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Valla "Lorenzo Valla") a few years later, and revealed the forgery of the _[Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Isidorian\_Decretals "Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals")_. He made friends with the Austrian astronomer [Georg von Peuerbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_von_Peuerbach "Georg von Peuerbach") and advocated a reform of the [Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar "Julian calendar") and the Easter [computus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus "Computus"), which, however, was not realized until the introduction of the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar") in 1582.

After the Archbishop Otto of Trier had died in 1430, [Pope Martin V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Martin_V "Pope Martin V") appointed the [Speyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishopric_of_Speyer "Bishopric of Speyer") bishop Raban of [Helmstatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmstadt-Bargen "Helmstadt-Bargen") his successor. Nevertheless, the Electorate was contested by opposing parties, and in 1432 Nicholas attended the [Council of Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Florence "Council of Florence") representing the Cologne dean Ulrich von Manderscheid, one of the claimants,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-5) who hoped to prevail against the new [Pope Eugene IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Eugene_IV "Pope Eugene IV"). Nicholas stressed the determining influence of the cathedral chapter and its given right to participate in the succession policy, which even places the pope under an obligation to seek a consent. His efforts were to no avail in regard to Ulrich's ambitions; however, Nicholas's pleadings earned him a great reputation as an intermediary and diplomat. While present at the council, he wrote his first work, _De concordantia catholica_ (_The Catholic Concordance_), a synthesis of ideas on church and empire balancing hierarchy with consent. This work remained useful to critics of the papacy long after Nicholas left Basel.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-6)

Initially as [conciliarist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conciliarism "Conciliarism"), Nicholas approached his university friend Cardinal Julian Cesarini, who had tried to reconcile pope and council, combining reform and hierarchic order. Nicholas supported transfer of the council to Italy to meet with the Greeks, who needed aid against the [Ottoman Turks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Turks "Ottoman Turks"). He arbitrated in the conflict with the [Hussites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussite "Hussite"). Between the summer of 1437 and early 1438 he was a member of the delegation sent to Constantinople with the pope's approval to bring back the Byzantine emperor and his representatives to the papally summoned [Council of Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Florence "Council of Florence") of 1439, which was attempting to bring the [Eastern Orthodox Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church") into union with the Western [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"). The reunion achieved at this conference turned out to be very brief. Nicholas would later claim (in the postfaced dedicatory letter of _On Learned Ignorance_, which Nicholas finished writing on 12 February 1440) that he had chosen to write on this metaphysical topic because of a shipboard experience of divine illumination while on the ship returning from this mission to Constantinople.

After a successful career as a papal envoy, he was made a cardinal by [Pope Nicholas V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Nicholas_V "Pope Nicholas V") in 1448 or 1449. In 1450 he was both named [Bishop of Brixen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Brixen "Bishop of Brixen"), in [Tyrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Tyrol "County of Tyrol"), and commissioned as a [papal legate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_legate "Papal legate") to the German lands to spread the message of reform. In 1444, the [White Tower of Brixen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Tower_(Brixen) "White Tower (Brixen)") caught fire and in 1459 he commissioned its reconstruction in a [Gothic style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_art "Gothic art"). This latter role, his 'Great Legation' of 1450–1452, involved travel of almost 3000 miles, preaching, teaching and reforming. He became known as the "Hercules of the Eugenian cause."[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-7) His local councils enacted reforms, many of which were not successful. Pope Nicholas canceled some of Nicholas's decrees, and the effort to discourage pilgrimages to venerate the bleeding hosts of [Wilsnack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilsnack "Wilsnack") (the so-called [Holy Blood of Wilsnack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Blood_of_Wilsnack "Holy Blood of Wilsnack")) was unsuccessful. His work as bishop between 1452 and 1458 – trying to impose reforms and reclaim lost diocesan revenues – was opposed by [Duke Sigismund of Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigismund,_Archduke_of_Austria "Sigismund, Archduke of Austria"). The duke imprisoned Nicholas in 1460, for which [Pope Pius II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_II "Pope Pius II")[excommunicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication "Excommunication") Sigismund and laid an [interdict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdict_(Roman_Catholic_Church) "Interdict (Roman Catholic Church)") on his lands. Nicholas returned to Rome, but was never able to return to his bishopric.

He died at [Todi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todi "Todi") in [Umbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbria "Umbria") on 11 August 1464. Sigismund's capitulation came a few days after Nicholas's death.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-8)

Tomb in [San Pietro in Vincoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pietro_in_Vincoli "San Pietro in Vincoli"), Rome, with the relief "Cardinal Nicholas before St Peter" by [Andrea Bregno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Bregno "Andrea Bregno")

Upon his death, Nicholas's body was interred in the church of [San Pietro in Vincoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pietro_in_Vincoli "San Pietro in Vincoli") in Rome, probably near the relic of Peter's chains; but it was later lost. His monument, with a sculpted image of the cardinal, remains. Two other tombstones, one medieval and one modern, also are found in the church. In accordance with his wishes, his heart rests within the chapel altar at the [Cusanusstift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusanusstift "Cusanusstift") in Kues. To this charitable institution that he had founded he bequeathed his entire inheritance; it still stands, and serves the purpose Nicholas intended for it, as a home for the aged. The Cusanusstift also houses many of his manuscripts.[[1]](https://www.cusanus.de/)

Nicholas's _[De Docta Ignorantia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Docta\_Ignorantia "De Docta Ignorantia")_ ('Of Learned Ignorance') is an epistemological and metaphysical treatise. He maintains the finite human mind cannot fully know the divine, infinite mind ('the Maximum'). Nonetheless, he holds that the human intellect can become aware of its limitations in knowing God and thus attain "learned ignorance". His theory shows the influence of [neoplatonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism "Neoplatonism") and [negative theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology "Apophatic theology"), and he frequently cites [Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Dionysius_the_Areopagite "Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite").

Nicholas was noted for his deeply [mystical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism") writings about [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"). He wrote of the enfolding of creation in God and their unfolding in creation. He was suspected by some of holding [pantheistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism "Pantheism") beliefs, but his writings were never accused of being [heretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy "Heresy").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-9) Nicholas also wrote in _De coniecturis_ about using conjectures or surmises to rise to better understanding of the truth. The individual might rise above mere reason to the vision of the intellect, but the same person might fall back from such vision.

Theologically, Nicholas anticipated the implications of Reformed teaching on the [harrowing of Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrowing_of_Hell "Harrowing of Hell") (Sermon on Psalm 30:11), followed by [Pico della Mirandola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_della_Mirandola "Pico della Mirandola"), who similarly explained the _descensus_ in terms of Christ's agony.

Science and mathematics
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicholas_of_Cusa&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Science and mathematics")]

Most of Nicholas's mathematical ideas can be found in his essays, _[De Docta Ignorantia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Docta\_Ignorantia "De Docta Ignorantia")_ (_Of Learned Ignorance_), _De Visione Dei_ (_On the Vision of God_) and _De coniecturis_ (_On Conjectures_). He also wrote on [squaring the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle "Squaring the circle") in his mathematical treatises.

Mathematics plays a key role for Cusanus in orienting the human mind towards God. Mathematical figures provide a means for the mind to consider how figures may be deformed and transformed, and thus prepares the mind to reach the "coincidence of opposites" in the "Absolutely maximal Being".

From the _[Catholic Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic\_Encyclopedia "Catholic Encyclopedia")_ (1913 edition):

> The astronomical views of the cardinal are scattered through his philosophical treatises. They evince complete independence of traditional doctrines, though they are based on symbolism of numbers, on combinations of letters, and on abstract speculations rather than observation. The earth is a star like other stars, is not the centre of the universe, is not at rest, nor are its poles fixed. The celestial bodies are not strictly spherical, nor are their orbits circular. The difference between theory and appearance is explained by relative motion. Had [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus") been aware of these assertions he would probably have been encouraged by them to publish his own monumental work.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-cathen-10)

Like [Nicole Oresme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme "Nicole Oresme"), Nicholas also wrote about the possibility of the plurality of worlds.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-12)

[Norman Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Norman_Moore,_1st_Baronet "Sir Norman Moore, 1st Baronet") tells us in The Fitz-Patrick Lectures of 1905:

> In medicine he introduced an improvement which in an altered form has continued in use to this day. This improvement was the counting of the pulse which up to his time had been felt and discussed in many ways but never counted. ...Nicholas of Cusa proposed to compare the rate of pulses by weighing the quantity of water run out of a water clock while the pulse beat one hundred times. ...The manufacture of watches with second-hands has since given us a simpler method of counting, but the merit of introducing this useful kind of observation into clinical medicine belongs to Nicholas of Cusa.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-13)

In 1433, Nicholas proposed reform of the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire") and a method to elect [Holy Roman Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperors "Holy Roman Emperors"). Although it was not adopted by the Church, his method was essentially the same one known today as the [Borda count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count "Borda count"), which is used in many academic institutions, competitions, and even some political jurisdictions, in original form and a number of variations. His proposal preceded [Borda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Charles_de_Borda "Jean-Charles de Borda")'s work by over three centuries.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-14)

Nicholas's opinions on the Empire, which he hoped to reform and strengthen, were cited against papal claims of temporal power in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Protestant writers were happy to cite a cardinal against Rome's assertions. Protestants, however, found his writings against the [Hussites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussites "Hussites") wrong. Nicholas seemed to Protestants to give the church too much power to interpret Scripture, instead of treating it as self-interpreting and self-sufficient for [salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation "Salvation"), the principle of _[sola scriptura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola\_scriptura "Sola scriptura")_.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-15)

Nicholas's own thought on the church changed with his departure from Basel. He tried arguing that the Basel assembly lacked the consent of the church throughout the world, especially the princes. Then he tried arguing that the church was unfolded from Peter (_explicatio Petri_).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-16) This allowed him to support the pope without abandoning ideas of reform. Thus, he was able to propose to Pius II reform of the church, beginning with the pope himself. Then it was to spread through the [Roman curia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_curia "Roman curia") and outward throughout Christendom.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-17)

Nicholas noted that government was founded on the [consent of the governed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed "Consent of the governed"):

Accordingly, since by nature all men are free, any authority by which subjects are prevented from doing evil and their freedom is restrained to doing good through fear from penalties, comes solely from harmony and from the consent of the subjects, whether the authority reside in written law or in the living law which is in the ruler. For if by nature men are equally strong and equally free, the true and settled power of one over the others, the ruler having equal natural power, could be set up only by the choice and consent of the others, just as a law also is set up by consent.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-19)
Shortly after the [Fall of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople "Fall of Constantinople") in 1453, Nicholas wrote _De pace fidei_, _On the Peace of Faith_. This visionary work imagined a summit meeting in [Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven "Heaven") of representatives of all nations and religions. Islam and the [Hussite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussite "Hussite") movement in [Bohemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemia "Bohemia") are represented. The conference agrees that there can be _una religio in varietate rituum_, a single faith manifested in different rites, as manifested in the eastern and western rites of the Catholic Church. The dialogue presupposes the greater accuracy of Christianity but gives respect to other religions.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-20) Nicholas's position was for Europeans not to retake Constantinople but simply to trade with the Ottomans and allow them their conquests. Less irenic but not virulent, is his _Cribratio Alchorani_, _Sifting the Koran_, a detailed review of the [Koran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koran "Koran") in Latin translation. While the arguments for the superiority of Christianity are still shown in this book, it also credits Judaism and Islam with sharing in the truth at least partially.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-21)

Nicholas was widely read, and his works were published in the sixteenth century in both Paris and Basel. Sixteenth-century French scholars, including [Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lef%C3%A8vre_d%27%C3%89taples "Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples") and [Charles de Bovelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Bovelles "Charles de Bovelles"), cited him. Lefèvre even edited the Paris 1514 _Opera_.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-22) Nonetheless, there was no Cusan school, and his works were largely unknown until the nineteenth century, though [Giordano Bruno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno "Giordano Bruno") quoted him, while some thinkers, like [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz"), were thought to have been influenced by him.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-23)[Neo-Kantian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Kantian "Neo-Kantian") scholars began studying Nicholas in the nineteenth century, and new editions were begun by the _[Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg\_Academy\_for\_Sciences\_and\_Humanities "Heidelberg Academy for Sciences and Humanities")_ in the 1930s and published by Felix Meiner Verlag.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-24) In the early twentieth century, he was hailed by [Ernst Cassirer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Cassirer "Ernst Cassirer") as the "first modern thinker,"[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-25) and much debate since then has centered around the question whether he should be seen as essentially a medieval or Renaissance figure. What is more, Cassirer presented Cusanus as the main focal point (_einfachen Brennpunkt_) of Italian Renaissance philosophy. Eminent scholars like Eugenio Garin and Paul Oskar Kristeller challenged Cassirer’s thesis, and went so far as to practically deny any considerable link between Nicholas of Cusa and Marsilio Ficino or Giovanni Pico.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-26) In the following decades, new hypotheses on the relationship between Cusanus and Italian humanists appeared, more balanced and focused on the sources.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-27)

Societies and centers dedicated to Nicholas can be found in Argentina, Japan, Germany, Italy and the United States. His well-known quote about the infinity of the universe is found paraphrased in the Central Holy Book of the [Thelemites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema "Thelema"), The Book of the Law, which was "received" from the Angel Aiwass by Aleister Crowley in Cairo in April 1904: "In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found."

Nicholas wrote a large number of works, which include:

*   _De auctoritate praesidendi in concilio generali_ (1434), a proposal for resolving the question of presidency over the deliberations of the Council of Basil.
*   _De concordantia catholica_ (_The Catholic Concordance_) (1434), a synthesis of ideas on church and empire balancing hierarchy with consent.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Cusanus#cite_note-28)
