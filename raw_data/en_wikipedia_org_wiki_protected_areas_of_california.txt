In addition, there are private conservation areas and other easements .

[ 1 ] They include almost one-third of California 's scenic coastline , including coastal wetlands , estuaries , beaches , and dune systems. The California State Parks system alone has 270 units and covers 1.3 million acres (5,300 km 2 ), with over 280 miles (450 km) of coastline, 625 miles (1,006 km) of lake and river frontage, nearly 18,000 campsites, and 3,000 miles (5,000 km) of hiking, biking, and equestrian trails.

Obtaining an accurate total of all protected land in California and elsewhere is a complex task. Many parcels have inholdings , private lands within the protected areas, which may or may not be accounted for when calculating total area. Also, occasionally one parcel of land is included in two or more inventories. Over 90% of Yosemite National Park for example, is listed both as wilderness by the National Wilderness Preservation System , and as national park land by the National Park Service . The Cosumnes River Preserve is an extreme example, owned and managed by a handful of public agencies and private landowners, including the Bureau of Land Management , the County of Sacramento and The Nature Conservancy .  Despite the difficulties, the CPAD gives the total area of protected land at 49,294,000 acres (199,490 km 2 ), or 47.05% of the state (not including easements); a considerable amount for the most populous state in the country.

National Park System [ edit ] Main articles: List of areas in the National Park System of the United States , List of National Parks of the United States , and List of National Monuments of the United States The U.S.

National Park System controls a large and diverse group of California parks, monuments, recreation areas and other units which in total exceed 6,240,000 acres (25,300 km 2 ).

[ 2 ] The best known is Yosemite National Park , noted for several iconic natural features including Yosemite Falls , El Capitan and Half Dome , which is displayed on the reverse side of the California state quarter . Other prominent parks are the Kings Canyon - Sequoia National Park complex, Redwood National Park , Channel Islands National Park , Joshua Tree National Park and the largest, Death Valley National Park . The NPS also administers the Manzanar National Historic Site in Inyo County .

[ 4 ] Bigelow Cholla Garden Wilderness National Marine Sanctuaries [ edit ] Main article: United States National Marine Sanctuary Sanderlings at the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary The National Marine Sanctuary System is managed by the Office of Marine Sanctuaries, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .

California has four of the thirteen U.S. National Marine Sanctuaries: Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary - one of the largest in the world at 5,300 square miles (14,000 km 2 ).

[ 5 ] National Wildlife Refuges [ edit ] Main article: National Wildlife Refuge National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is a designation for certain protected areas of the United States managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The National Wildlife Refuge System is an extensive system of public lands and waters set aside to conserve America's fish, wildlife and plants. Many of the state's refuges are important stops and destinations for millions of migrating birds along the Pacific Flyway corridor. One, the Butte Sink Wildlife Management Area , has the highest density of waterfowl in the world.

[ 6 ] There are 38 units in the refuge system in California, including both wildlife refuges and wildlife management areas, divided into 9 different regional areas. Combined the areas equal about 440,000 acres (1,800 km 2 ).

[ 9 ] The largest is Death Valley Wilderness at 3,055,413 acres (12,364.82 km 2 ), the largest federally designated wilderness in the continental United States, and the smallest is the Rocks and Islands Wilderness at 19 acres (77,000 m 2 ). The wilderness areas are managed by the US Forest Service , Bureau of Land Management , US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service . Rarely, if ever, are designated wilderness areas stand alone protected areas, and thus their areas are, in all likelihood, already accounted for in the various agencies' inventories.

Emerald Lake in the Trinity Alps Wilderness National Forests [ edit ] Main article: List of U.S. National Forests California has 17 U.S. National Forests, one special management unit ( Lake Tahoe ) and parts of 3 other National Forests. Total combined area of the forests is 20,061,888 acres (81,187.58 km 2 ) and covers over 19% of the state. The largest forest entirely within the state is Shasta-Trinity National Forest , at 2,209,832 acres (8,942.87 km 2 ), the smallest is Cleveland National Forest at 460,000 acres (1,900 km 2 ). The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit is not precisely a national forest in the conventional sense. Instead the Forest Service manages the land with particular attention paid to Lake Tahoe and its relationship with the forests surrounding it, with emphasis on erosion control management and watershed restoration, among other more conventional forest management activities. It is the smallest of the Forest Service units in California, with 191,000 acres (770 km 2 ) in its jurisdiction split between California and Nevada .

The Inyo National Forest contains Mount Whitney , the highest point in California.

The forests represent the most common forest types in the state. The State Forests grow approximately 75 million board feet of timber annually and harvest an average of 30 million board feet each year, enough to build 3,000 single-family homes. Revenue from these harvests fund the management of the State Forests. In addition, the forests provide research and demonstration opportunities for natural resource management, while providing public recreation opportunities, fish and wildlife habitat, and watershed protection. Activities include: experimental timber harvesting techniques, watershed restoration, mushroom collecting, hunting, firewood gathering, cone collecting for seed, a variety of university research projects, horseback riding, camping, mountain biking, and hiking.

Rain-soaked wetlands at the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area Municipal parks [ edit ] Main article: Urban park Most cities and counties in California, as in elsewhere, own and operate open spaces of various types, the most recognizable being the city and county park . By far the largest inventory of protected land held by a municipal agency belongs to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , with just over 400,000 acres (1,600 km 2 ) in its jurisdiction.

[ 19 ] The largest city park in the state is Mission Trails Regional Park in San Diego at 5,800 acres (23 km 2 ), although there are several county and regional parks that are larger. Total land owned by municipal agencies is roughly 1,500,000 acres (6,100 km 2 ) acres.

Griffith Park in the city of Los Angeles See also: List of parks in Los Angeles County, California ; List of parks in Los Angeles ; List of parks in San Francisco ; List of parks in San Diego ; and List of parks in Oakland, California Privately owned preserves [ edit ] In addition to the many public lands are about 550,000 acres (2,200 km 2 ) of privately owned preserves.

The Wildlands Conservancy is the largest owner of protected lands with 180,686 acres (731.21 km 2 ).

The Nature Conservancy has been involved in over 100 projects in the state since 1958.

[ 20 ] Many are eventually transferred to public agencies, but the Conservancy still owns and maintains several substantial preserves, including the Gray Davis/Dye Creek Preserve, Vina Plains Preserve, McCloud River Preserve, Cosumnes River Preserve , Santa Cruz Island , Irvine Ranch Wildlands and the Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve. The largest private preserve is the 93,000 acres (380 km 2 ) Wind Wolves Preserve owned by the aforementioned Wildlands Conservancy.

[ 21 ] In total, there are many dozens of land trust and conservation organizations active in California, with thousands of acres preserved on public and private lands through their efforts.

[ 22 ] A few that operate entirely or substantially in the state are the Peninsula Open Space Trust, the Northern Sierra Partnership, the Sempervirens Fund , the Sacramento Valley Conservancy and the Wilderness Land Trust .
