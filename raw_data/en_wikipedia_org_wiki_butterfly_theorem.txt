Butterfly theorem The butterfly theorem is a classical result in Euclidean geometry , which can be stated as follows: [ 1 ] : p. 78 Let M be the midpoint of a chord PQ of a circle , through which two other chords AB and CD are drawn; AD and BC intersect chord PQ at X and Y correspondingly. Then M is the midpoint of XY .

Proof [ edit ] Proof of Butterfly theorem A formal proof of the theorem is as follows:
Let the perpendiculars XX′ and XX″ be dropped from the point X on the straight lines AM and DM respectively. Similarly, let YY′ and YY″ be dropped from the point Y perpendicular to the straight lines BM and CM respectively.

Since △ △ M X X ′ ∼ ∼ △ △ M Y Y ′ , {\displaystyle \triangle MXX'\sim \triangle MYY',} M X M Y = X X ′ Y Y ′ , {\displaystyle {MX \over MY}={XX' \over YY'},} △ △ M X X ″ ∼ ∼ △ △ M Y Y ″ , {\displaystyle \triangle MXX''\sim \triangle MYY'',} M X M Y = X X ″ Y Y ″ , {\displaystyle {MX \over MY}={XX'' \over YY''},} △ △ A X X ′ ∼ ∼ △ △ C Y Y ″ , {\displaystyle \triangle AXX'\sim \triangle CYY'',} X X ′ Y Y ″ = A X C Y , {\displaystyle {XX' \over YY''}={AX \over CY},} △ △ D X X ″ ∼ ∼ △ △ B Y Y ′ , {\displaystyle \triangle DXX''\sim \triangle BYY',} X X ″ Y Y ′ = D X B Y .

{\displaystyle {XX'' \over YY'}={DX \over BY}.} From the preceding equations and the intersecting chords theorem , it can be seen that ( M X M Y ) 2 = X X ′ Y Y ′ X X ″ Y Y ″ , {\displaystyle \left({MX \over MY}\right)^{2}={XX' \over YY'}{XX'' \over YY''},} = A X ⋅ ⋅ D X C Y ⋅ ⋅ B Y , {\displaystyle {}={AX\cdot DX \over CY\cdot BY},} = P X ⋅ ⋅ Q X P Y ⋅ ⋅ Q Y , {\displaystyle {}={PX\cdot QX \over PY\cdot QY},} = ( P M − − X M ) ⋅ ⋅ ( M Q + X M ) ( P M + M Y ) ⋅ ⋅ ( Q M − − M Y ) , {\displaystyle {}={(PM-XM)\cdot (MQ+XM) \over (PM+MY)\cdot (QM-MY)},} = ( P M ) 2 − − ( M X ) 2 ( P M ) 2 − − ( M Y ) 2 , {\displaystyle {}={(PM)^{2}-(MX)^{2} \over (PM)^{2}-(MY)^{2}},} since PM = MQ .

So, ( M X ) 2 ( M Y ) 2 = ( P M ) 2 − − ( M X ) 2 ( P M ) 2 − − ( M Y ) 2 .

{\displaystyle {(MX)^{2} \over (MY)^{2}}={(PM)^{2}-(MX)^{2} \over (PM)^{2}-(MY)^{2}}.} Cross-multiplying in the latter equation, ( M X ) 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( P M ) 2 − − ( M X ) 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( M Y ) 2 = ( M Y ) 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( P M ) 2 − − ( M X ) 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( M Y ) 2 .

{\displaystyle {(MX)^{2}\cdot (PM)^{2}-(MX)^{2}\cdot (MY)^{2}}={(MY)^{2}\cdot (PM)^{2}-(MX)^{2}\cdot (MY)^{2}}.} Cancelling the common term − − ( M X ) 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( M Y ) 2 {\displaystyle {-(MX)^{2}\cdot (MY)^{2}}} from both sides of the equation yields ( M X ) 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( P M ) 2 = ( M Y ) 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( P M ) 2 , {\displaystyle {(MX)^{2}\cdot (PM)^{2}}={(MY)^{2}\cdot (PM)^{2}},} hence MX = MY , since MX, MY, and PM are all positive, real numbers.

Thus, M is the midpoint of XY .

Other proofs exist, [ 2 ] including one using projective geometry .

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] Proving the butterfly theorem was posed as a problem by William Wallace in The Gentleman's Mathematical Companion (1803). Three solutions were published in 1804, and in 1805 Sir William Herschel posed the question again in a letter to Wallace. Reverend Thomas Scurr asked the same question again in 1814 in the Gentleman's Diary or Mathematical Repository .
