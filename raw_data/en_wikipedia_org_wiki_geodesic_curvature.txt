For example, for 1D curves on a 2D surface embedded in 3D space , it is the curvature of the curve projected onto the surface's tangent plane . More generally, in a given manifold M ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {M}}} , the geodesic curvature is just the usual curvature of γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } (see below). However, when the curve γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is restricted to lie on a submanifold M {\displaystyle M} of M ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {M}}} (e.g. for curves on surfaces ), geodesic curvature refers to the curvature of γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } in M {\displaystyle M} and it is different in general from the curvature of γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } in the ambient manifold M ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {M}}} . The (ambient) curvature k {\displaystyle k} of γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } depends on two factors: the curvature of the submanifold M {\displaystyle M} in the direction of γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } (the normal curvature k n {\displaystyle k_{n}} ), which depends only on the direction of the curve, and the curvature of γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } seen in M {\displaystyle M} (the geodesic curvature k g {\displaystyle k_{g}} ), which is a second order quantity. The relation between these is k = k g 2 + k n 2 {\displaystyle k={\sqrt {k_{g}^{2}+k_{n}^{2}}}} . In particular geodesics on M {\displaystyle M} have zero geodesic curvature (they are "straight"), so that k = k n {\displaystyle k=k_{n}} , which explains why they appear to be curved in ambient space whenever the submanifold is.

Definition [ edit ] Consider a curve γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } in a manifold M ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {M}}} , parametrized by arclength , with unit tangent vector T = d γ γ / d s {\displaystyle T=d\gamma /ds} . Its curvature is the norm of the covariant derivative of T {\displaystyle T} : k = ‖ ‖ D T / d s ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle k=\|DT/ds\|} . If γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } lies on M {\displaystyle M} , the geodesic curvature is the norm of the projection of the covariant derivative D T / d s {\displaystyle DT/ds} on the tangent space to the submanifold. Conversely the normal curvature is the norm of the projection of D T / d s {\displaystyle DT/ds} on the normal bundle to the submanifold at the point considered.

If the ambient manifold is the euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , then the covariant derivative D T / d s {\displaystyle DT/ds} is just the usual derivative d T / d s {\displaystyle dT/ds} .

If γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is unit-speed, i.e.

‖ ‖ γ γ ′ ( s ) ‖ ‖ = 1 {\displaystyle \|\gamma '(s)\|=1} , and N {\displaystyle N} designates the unit normal field of M {\displaystyle M} along γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } , the geodesic curvature is given by k g = γ γ ″ ( s ) ⋅ ⋅ ( N ( γ γ ( s ) ) × × γ γ ′ ( s ) ) = [ d 2 γ γ ( s ) d s 2 , N ( γ γ ( s ) ) , d γ γ ( s ) d s ] , {\displaystyle k_{g}=\gamma ''(s)\cdot {\Big (}N(\gamma (s))\times \gamma '(s){\Big )}=\left[{\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}\gamma (s)}{\mathrm {d} s^{2}}},N(\gamma (s)),{\frac {\mathrm {d} \gamma (s)}{\mathrm {d} s}}\right]\,,} where the square brackets denote the scalar triple product .

Example [ edit ] Let M {\displaystyle M} be the unit sphere S 2 {\displaystyle S^{2}} in three-dimensional Euclidean space . The normal curvature of S 2 {\displaystyle S^{2}} is identically 1, independently of the direction considered. Great circles have curvature k = 1 {\displaystyle k=1} , so they have zero geodesic curvature, and are therefore geodesics. Smaller circles of radius r {\displaystyle r} will have curvature 1 / r {\displaystyle 1/r} and geodesic curvature k g = 1 − − r 2 r {\displaystyle k_{g}={\frac {\sqrt {1-r^{2}}}{r}}} .

Some results involving geodesic curvature [ edit ] The geodesic curvature is none other than the usual curvature of the curve when computed intrinsically in the submanifold M {\displaystyle M} . It does not depend on the way the submanifold M {\displaystyle M} sits in M ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {M}}} .

Geodesics of M {\displaystyle M} have zero geodesic curvature, which is equivalent to saying that D T / d s {\displaystyle DT/ds} is orthogonal to the tangent space to M {\displaystyle M} .

On the other hand the normal curvature depends strongly on how the submanifold lies in the ambient space, but marginally on the curve: k n {\displaystyle k_{n}} only depends on the point on the submanifold and the direction T {\displaystyle T} , but not on D T / d s {\displaystyle DT/ds} .

In general Riemannian geometry, the derivative is computed using the Levi-Civita connection ∇ ∇ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {\nabla }}} of the ambient manifold: D T / d s = ∇ ∇ ¯ ¯ T T {\displaystyle DT/ds={\bar {\nabla }}_{T}T} . It splits into a tangent part and a normal part to the submanifold: ∇ ∇ ¯ ¯ T T = ∇ ∇ T T + ( ∇ ∇ ¯ ¯ T T ) ⊥ ⊥ {\displaystyle {\bar {\nabla }}_{T}T=\nabla _{T}T+({\bar {\nabla }}_{T}T)^{\perp }} . The tangent part is the usual derivative ∇ ∇ T T {\displaystyle \nabla _{T}T} in M {\displaystyle M} (it is a particular case of Gauss equation in the Gauss-Codazzi equations ), while the normal part is I I ( T , T ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {I\!I} (T,T)} , where I I {\displaystyle \mathrm {I\!I} } denotes the second fundamental form .
