Until the mid-19th century, both Cambridge and Oxford comprised a group of colleges with a small central university administration, rather than universities in the common sense. Cambridge's colleges are communities of students, academics and staff – an environment in which generations and academic disciplines are able to mix, with both students and fellows experiencing "the breadth and excellence of a top University at an intimate level".

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Cambridge colleges provide most of the accommodation for undergraduates and postgraduates at the university. At the undergraduate level they have responsibility for admitting students to the university, providing pastoral support, and organising elements of their tuition, though lectures and examinations are organised by the faculties and departments of the central university. All degrees are awarded by the university itself, not the colleges, and all students study for the same course regardless of which college they attend.

[ 3 ] For postgraduate students, research is conducted centrally in the faculties, departments and other university-affiliated research centres, though the colleges provide a central social and intellectual hub for students.

Colleges provide a range of facilities and services to their members in addition to accommodation, [ 4 ] including: catering, library facilities, extracurricular societies, and sporting teams. Much of sporting life at Cambridge is centred around college teams and inter-collegiate competition in Cuppers . Student activity is typically organised through separate common rooms for undergraduate and postgraduate students. Another important element of collegiate life is formal hall , which range in frequency from weekly to every night of the week during Full Term.

Colleges also provide funding, accommodation, or both, for some of the academic posts in the university, with the majority of Cambridge academics being a fellow of a college in addition to their faculty/departmental role.

[ 5 ] Fellows may therefore hold college positions in addition to their academic posts at the university: these include roles such as Tutor (responsible for pastoral support), Director of Studies (responsible for academic oversight of students taking a particular subject), Dean (responsible for discipline among college members), Senior Tutor (responsible for the college's overall academic provision), or Head of college ('Head of House').

Colleges are self-governed charities in their own right, with their own endowments and possessions.

"Old" and "new" colleges [ edit ] The University of Cambridge has 31 colleges, [ 5 ] founded between the 13th and 20th centuries. No colleges were founded between 1596 ( Sidney Sussex College ) and 1800 ( Downing College ), which allows the colleges to be distinguished into two groups according to foundation date: the 16 "old" colleges, founded between 1284 and 1596, and the 15 "new" colleges, founded between 1800 and 1977.

The oldest college is Peterhouse , founded in 1284, [ 6 ] and the newest is Robinson , founded in 1977.

[ 7 ] Homerton , which was first founded in the eighteenth century as a dissenting academy (and later teacher training college), attained full college status in 2010.

Six of the "new" colleges (Churchill, Fitzwilliam, Girton, Lucy Cavendish, Murray Edwards and St Edmund's) are located on Castle Hill and are thus sometimes referred to as "hill colleges".

[ 8 ] Restrictions on entry [ edit ] All 16 of the "old" colleges and 8 of the 15 "new" ones admit both male and female students as both undergraduates and postgraduates, without any age restrictions. Seven colleges restrict entry by sex, or by age of undergraduates, or admit only postgraduates: Murray Edwards and Newnham admit only women; [ 9 ] Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates; Hughes Hall , St Edmund's and Wolfson admit only mature students and postgraduates.

[ 10 ] No colleges are all-male, although most originally were.

Darwin , founded in 1964, was the first mixed college, while in 1972 Churchill , Clare and King's colleges were the first previously all-male colleges to admit women, whilst King's only accepted students from Eton College until 1865. The last all-male college to become mixed was Magdalene , in 1988.

[ 11 ] In 1973 Hughes Hall became the first all-female college to admit men, and Girton first admitted men in 1979.

Lucy Cavendish only admitted female mature students and postgraduates until 2021.

[ 9 ] Newnham also places restrictions on the admission of staff members, allowing only women to become fellows of the college. Murray Edwards does not place this restriction on fellows.

Architectural influence [ edit ] Main article: Collegiate Gothic The Cambridge and Oxford colleges have served as an architectural inspiration for Collegiate Gothic architecture, used by a number of American universities including Princeton University , Cornell University , University of Chicago , and Washington University in St. Louis since the late nineteenth century.
