Tomb of Nakht , 18th dynasty , Thebes , Ancient Egypt .

Sourdough starter.

In food processing , fermentation is the conversion of carbohydrates to alcohol or organic acids using microorganisms — yeasts or bacteria —without an oxidizing agent being used in the reaction.

Fermentation usually implies that the action of microorganisms is desired.

[ 1 ] The science of fermentation is known as zymology or zymurgy.

The term "fermentation" sometimes refers specifically to the chemical conversion of sugars into ethanol , producing alcoholic drinks such as wine , beer , and cider . However, similar processes take place in the leavening of bread (CO 2 produced by yeast activity), and in the preservation of sour foods with the production of lactic acid , such as in sauerkraut and yogurt . Humans have an enzyme that gives us an enhanced ability to break down ethanol.

Other widely consumed fermented foods include vinegar , olives , and cheese . More localized foods prepared by fermentation may also be based on beans, grain, vegetables, fruit, honey, dairy products, and fish.

History and prehistory [ edit ] Conical loaves of bread left as grave goods , exactly as laid out in the Great Tomb at Gebelein , Egypt , 2435–2305 BC Further information: History of biochemistry , History of bread , and History of microbiology Brewing and winemaking [ edit ] Main articles: Brewing § History , and History of wine See also: History of beer Natural fermentation predates human history. Since ancient times, humans have exploited the fermentation process. They likely began fermenting foods unintentionally. To store excess foods, humans placed the items in a container where they were forgotten. Over time, yeast and bacteria started to grow. This led humans to unveil fermented foods.

[ 2 ] The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation is 13,000-year-old residues of a beer, with the consistency of gruel, found in a cave near Haifa in Israel.

[ 3 ] Another early alcoholic drink, made from fruit, rice, and honey, dates from 7000 to 6600 BC, in the Neolithic Chinese village of Jiahu , [ 4 ] and winemaking dates from ca. 6000 BC, in Georgia , in the Caucasus area.

[ 5 ] Seven-thousand-year-old jars containing the remains of wine, now on display at the University of Pennsylvania, were excavated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran .

[ 6 ] There is strong evidence that people were fermenting alcoholic drinks in Babylon ca. 3000 BC, [ 7 ] ancient Egypt ca. 3150 BC, [ 8 ] pre-Hispanic Mexico ca. 2000 BC, [ 7 ] and Sudan ca. 1500 BC.

[ 9 ] Discovery of the role of yeast [ edit ] The French chemist Louis Pasteur founded zymology , when in 1856 he connected yeast to fermentation.

[ 10 ] When studying the fermentation of sugar to alcohol by yeast , Pasteur concluded that the fermentation was catalyzed by a vital force, called " ferments ", within the yeast cells.  The "ferments" were thought to function only within living organisms. Pasteur wrote that "Alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells, not with the death or putrefaction of the cells." [ 11 ] "Cell-free fermentation" [ edit ] Nevertheless, it was known that yeast extracts can ferment sugar even in the absence of living yeast cells . While studying this process in 1897, the German chemist and zymologist Eduard Buchner of Humboldt University of Berlin , Germany, found that sugar was fermented even when there were no living yeast cells in the mixture, [ 12 ] by an enzyme complex secreted by yeast that he termed zymase .

[ 13 ] In 1907 he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research and discovery of "cell-free fermentation".

One year earlier, in 1906, ethanol fermentation studies led to the early discovery of oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ).

[ 14 ] [ verification needed ] Uses [ edit ] Further information: Microbes in human culture and List of microorganisms used in food and beverage preparation Beer and bread, two major uses of fermentation in food Food fermentation is the conversion of sugars and other carbohydrates into alcohol or preservative organic acids and carbon dioxide . All three products have found human uses. The production of alcohol is made use of when fruit juices are converted to wine , when grains are made into beer , and when foods rich in starch, such as potatoes , are fermented and then distilled to make spirits such as gin and vodka . The production of carbon dioxide is used to leaven bread. The production of organic acids is exploited to preserve and flavor vegetables and dairy products.

[ 15 ] Food fermentation serves five main purposes: to enrich the diet through development of a diversity of flavors, aromas, and textures in food substrates; to preserve substantial amounts of food through lactic acid , alcohol, acetic acid , and alkaline [ 16 ] fermentations; to enrich food substrates with protein, essential amino acids , and vitamins; to eliminate antinutrients ; and to reduce cooking time and the associated use of fuel.

[ 17 ] Beverages produced through fermentation have likely universally been associated with ceremonies and festivals. There is some understanding of how they have been consumed in such contexts, derived from the construction of drinkware, and residue contained therein.

Failing to completely remove any microbes from equipment and storing vessels may result in the multiplication of harmful organisms within the ferment, potentially increasing the risks of food borne illnesses such as botulism. However, botulism in vegetable ferments is only possible when not properly canned.  The production of off smells and discoloration may be indications that harmful bacteria may have been introduced to the food.

Alaska has witnessed a steady increase of cases of botulism since 1985.

[ 19 ] It has more cases of botulism than any other state in the United States of America. This is caused by the traditional Alaska Native practice of allowing animal products such as whole fish, fish heads, walrus , sea lion , and whale flippers, beaver tails, seal oil, and birds, to ferment for an extended period of time before being consumed. The risk is exacerbated when a plastic container is used for this purpose instead of the old-fashioned, traditional method, a grass-lined hole, as the Clostridium botulinum bacteria thrive in the anaerobic conditions created by the air-tight enclosure in plastic.

[ 19 ] Research has found that fermented food contains a carcinogenic by-product, ethyl carbamate (urethane).

[ 20 ] "A 2009 review of the existing studies conducted across Asia concluded that regularly eating pickled vegetables roughly doubles a person's risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ."
