The most common units in modern use are the metric units , used in every country globally. In the United States the U.S. customary units are also in use. British Imperial units are still used for some purposes in the United Kingdom and some other countries. The metric system is sub-divided into SI and non-SI units.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] History [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from History of measurement § Units of length .

[ edit ] Before the establishment of the decimal metric system in France during the French Revolution in the late 18th century , [ 4 ] many units of length were based on parts of the human body .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The Nippur cubit was one of the oldest known units of length. The oldest known metal standard for length corresponds to this Sumerian unit and dates from 2650 BCE.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] This copper bar was discovered in Nippur , on the banks of the Euphrates , and is kept in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum . Archaeologists consider that this 51.85 centimetres long unit was the origin of the Roman foot . Indeed, the Egyptians divided the Sumerian cubit into 28 fingers and 16 of these fingers gave a Roman foot of 29.633 cm.

[ 8 ] [ 6 ] Metric system [ edit ] Main article: Metric system SI [ edit ] Main article: International System of Units See also: Orders of magnitude (length) The base unit in the International System of Units (SI) is the meter , defined as "the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1 ⁄ 299792458 seconds." [ 9 ] It is approximately equal to 1.0936 yd . Other SI units are derived from the meter by adding prefixes , as in millimeter or kilometer, thus producing systematic decimal multiples and submultiples of the base unit that span many orders of magnitude. For example, a kilometer is 1000 m .

Non-SI [ edit ] In the centimeter–gram–second system of units , the basic unit of length is the centimeter , or 1 ⁄ 100 of a meter.
Other non-SI units are derived from decimal multiples of the meter.

[ edit ] Main articles: Imperial units , United States customary units , and English units § length The basic unit of length in the imperial and U.S. customary systems is the yard , defined as exactly 0.9144 m by international treaty in 1959.

[ 2 ] [ 10 ] Common imperial units and U.S. customary units of length include: [ 11 ] thou or mil ( 1 ⁄ 1000 of an inch) inch ( 25.4 mm ) foot (12 inches, 0.3048 m) yard (3 feet, 0.9144 m) (terrestrial) mile (5280 feet, or 1760 yards 1609.344 m) (land) league 3 miles (4,800 m) Marine [ edit ] In addition, the following are used by sailors : fathom (for depth; only in non-metric countries) (2 yards = 1.8288 m) nautical mile (one minute of arc of latitude = 1852 m ) Aviation [ edit ] Aviators use feet for altitude worldwide (except in Russia and China) and nautical miles for distance.

[ citation needed ] Surveying [ edit ] Determination of the rod, using the length of the left foot of 16 randomly chosen people coming from church service Surveyors in the United States continue to use: chain (22 yards, or 20.1168 m ) rod (also called pole or perch) (quarter of a chain, 5 1 ⁄ 2 yards, or 5.0292 m ) Australian building trades [ edit ] The Australian building trades adopted the metric system in 1966 and the units used for measurement of length are meters (m) and millimeters (mm).

Centimeters (cm) are avoided as they cause confusion when reading plans . For example, the length two and a half meters is usually recorded as 2500 mm or 2.5 m; it would be considered non-standard to record this length as 250 cm.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Surveyor's trade [ edit ] American surveyors use a decimal-based system of measurement devised by Edmund Gunter in 1620. The base unit is Gunter's chain of 66 feet (20 m) which is subdivided into 4 rods, each of 16.5 ft or 100 links of 0.66 feet. A link is abbreviated "lk",  and links "lks", in old deeds and land surveys done for the government.

This is often a characteristic radius or wavelength of a particle. Some common natural units of length are included in this table: Atomic property Symbol Length, in meters Reference The classical electron radius r e 2.817 940 285 (31) × 10 −15 [ 18 ] The Compton wavelength of the electron λ C 2.426 310 215 (18) × 10 −12 [ 18 ] The reduced Compton wavelength of the electron λ C 3.861 592 6764 (18) × 10 −13 [ 19 ] The Compton wavelength (or reduced Compton wavelength) of any fundamental particle λ x The Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom ( Atomic unit of length) a 0 5.291 772 083 (19) × 10 −11 [ 18 ] The reduced wavelength of hydrogen radiation 1 / R ∞ 9.112 670 505 509 (83) × 10 −8 [ 18 ] The Planck length 𝓁 P 1.616 199 (97) × 10 −35 [ 20 ] Stoney unit of length l S 1.381 × 10 −35 Quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) unit of length l QCD 2.103 × 10 −16 Natural units based on the electronvolt 1 eV −1 1.97 × 10 −7 Archaic [ edit ] See also: English units of length Archaic units of distance include: cana cubit rope league li (China) pace (the "double pace" of about 5 feet used in Ancient Rome ) verst (Russia) Informal [ edit ] See also: List of humorous units of measurement and List of unusual units of measurement In everyday conversation, and in informal literature, it is common to see lengths measured in units of objects of which everyone knows the approximate width. Common examples are: Double-decker bus (9.5–11 meters in length) American football field (100 yards in length) Thickness of a human hair (around 80 micrometers) Other [ edit ] Horse racing and other equestrian activities keep alive: furlong = 1 ⁄ 8 mile (201.168 m) horse length ≈ 8 feet (2.4 m) See also [ edit ] List of conversion factors § Length List of examples of lengths List of unusual units of measurement § Length Medieval weights and measures Orders of magnitude (length) System of measurement Units of measurement References [ edit ] ^ Cardarelli, François (2003).
