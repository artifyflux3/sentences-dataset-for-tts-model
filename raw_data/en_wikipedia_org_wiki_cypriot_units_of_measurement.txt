Before the Metric system , the Imperial system was used.  In between 1986-1988, metric system was adopted in Cyprus.

[ 1 ] Units used alongside the Imperial system [ edit ] A number of units were used alongside the Imperial system.

Other units used were the following: [ 2 ] [ 3 ] 1 dram = 3.17514659 g or 1 ⁄ 400 oke; in Imperial units, it was equivalent to 49 grains 1 Cyprus litre = 2.2861055448 kg or 1 + 4 ⁄ 5 okes or 720 drams; in Imperial units, it was equivalent to 5 + 1 ⁄ 25 pounds 1 kantar = 55,882579984 kg or 44 okes, or 24 + 4 ⁄ 9 Cyprus litres; [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] in Imperial units, it was equivalent to 123 + 1 ⁄ 5 pounds 1 Aleppo kantar (used for carobs) = 228.61055448 kg or 180 okes, 100 Cyprus litres, or 11 ⁄ 45 kantar; in Imperial units, it was equivalent to 504 pounds 1 ton = 1016,0469088 kg or 800 okes, 444 + 4 ⁄ 9 Cyprus litres, 18 + 2 ⁄ 11 kantars, or 4 + 4 ⁄ 9 Aleppo kantars; in Imperial units, it is equivalent to 20 long cwt or 2240 pounds Capacity [ edit ] One kilé was equal to 1 Imperial bushel or 8 gallons , i.e. 36.368735032 L. Prior to the adoption of the metric system for units of capacity in 1986 (1988 for milk), this was the base unit for capacity [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Other units used (for dry and liquid measures) were the following: 1 pint = 568.261484875 mL or 20 fluid ounces 1 quart = 1.13652296975 L or 2 pints, or 1 + 3 ⁄ 25 Cyprus litres 1 Cyprus oke = 1.27290572612 L or 2 + 6 ⁄ 25 Cyprus litres 1 Cyprus litre = 3.1822643153 L or 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 Cyprus okes, or 2 + 4 ⁄ 5 quarts 1 gallon = 4.546091879 L or 4 quarts, or 8 pints
