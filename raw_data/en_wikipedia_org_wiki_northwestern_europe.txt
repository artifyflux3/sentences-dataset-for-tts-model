The term is used in geographic, [ 1 ] history, [ 2 ] and military contexts.

[ 3 ] Geographic definitions [ edit ] Geographically , Northwestern Europe is given by some sources as a region which includes Great Britain , [ 4 ] Ireland , [ 4 ] Belgium , [ 5 ] the Netherlands , [ 5 ] Luxembourg , [ 6 ] Northern France , [ 5 ] parts of or all of Germany , [ 7 ] [ 6 ] Denmark , [ 4 ] Norway , [ 6 ] Sweden , [ 6 ] and Iceland .

[ 2 ] [ 8 ] In some works, Switzerland , Finland , and Austria are also included as part of Northwestern Europe.

[ 6 ] Under the Interreg program, funded by the European Regional Development Fund , "North-West Europe" (NWE) is a region of European Territorial Cooperation that includes Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, the Netherlands and parts of France and Germany.

[ 7 ] Ethnography [ edit ] During the Reformation , some parts of Northwestern Europe converted to Protestantism , [ 9 ] in a manner which differentiated the region from its Roman Catholic neighbors elsewhere in Europe.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] A definition of Northwestern Europe was used by some late 19th to mid-20th century anthropologists , eugenicists , and Nordicists , who used the term as a shorthand term for the part of Europe with a predominantly Nordic population.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] For example, Arthur de Gobineau , the 19th-century aristocrat who published works on the pseudoscience of scientific racism , included parts of Northwestern Europe in what Leon Baradat described as his "Aryan heaven".

[ 16 ] Genetics [ edit ] There is close genetic affinity among some Northwest European populations, [ 17 ] with some of these populations descending from Bell Beaker populations carrying steppe ancestry .

[ citation needed ] For example, the Beaker people of the lower Rhine overturned 90% of Great Britain's gene pools, replacing the Basque-like neolithic populations present prior.

Most of northwestern Europe converted to Protestantism, while most of southwestern Europe remained Catholic. Whether climate or ethnicity (northwestern Europe was more Germanic, southwestern Europe more latin) was the greater factor in this division remains a matter of dispute ^ Ciment, James; Radzilowski, John (2015).
