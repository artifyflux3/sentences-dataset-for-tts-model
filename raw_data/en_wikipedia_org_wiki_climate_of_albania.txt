Hot Mediterranean climate Warm Mediterranean climate Subtropical climate Oceanic climate Continental climate Subarctic climate Albania is one of the most climatically diverse countries in the world relative to its size. Despite covering just 28,748 square kilometers, it encompasses 9 Köppen climate types, including varieties of Mediterranean , Subtropical , Oceanic , Continental , Subarctic , and Alpine tundra climates. This exceptional variation is the result of Albania’s complex terrain, latitudinal placement in the mid-latitudes of southeastern Europe, proximity to the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, and the presence of major mountain systems and inland freshwater bodies.

[ 1 ] The country’s topographic relief is among the steepest in Europe, with elevation rising from sea level to over 2000 meters  in less than 50 kilometers in many areas. These factors create extreme climatic variability, making Albania a microcosm of the wider European and even Eurasian climate system.

[ 2 ] Climatic Diversity and Geographic Determinants [ edit ] The Holdridge Lifezones Chart  vital for understanding the dynamics behind the Albanian Climate zones Albania’s extraordinary climatic variety is made possible by its precise geographic positioning at the crossroads of contrasting atmospheric regimes and physiographic zones. Located between latitudes 39° and 42° N, the country occupies a transitional belt where subtropical Mediterranean systems to the west meet temperate continental air masses from the east and northeast. Its western coastline is fully exposed to the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, enabling frequent incursions of moist maritime air that bring abundant precipitation, particularly in winter. Simultaneously, its interior lies within reach of drier, colder continental systems, including polar air masses during winter, which contribute to sharper seasonal contrasts and frost-prone conditions in inland valleys and plateaus. Albania’s sharply varied terrain enhances this atmospheric complexity: mountain ranges aligned parallel and perpendicular to the coast interact with shifting airflows to produce intense orographic uplift , localized rain shadows , and steep microclimatic gradients. The country’s position along the boundary between Mediterranean and continental climate zones ensures that even small shifts in altitude or distance from the sea result in markedly different thermal and precipitation regimes. Adding further nuance, Albania contains an extensive network of freshwater lakes and rivers—such as Lakes Shkoder , Ohrid , and Prespa , and the Drin and Shkumbin rivers—which act as regional thermal moderators, support humidity , and shape fog-prone microclimates . This convergence of maritime exposure, continental penetration, complex relief , and inland hydrology—compressed into a territory of  than 28.748 square kilometers—creates one of the most densely layered climatic landscapes in the world, unmatched in scale for a country of its size.

[ 2 ] Climatic Zones of Albania [ edit ] Csa:Hot-summer Mediterranean Ksamil Islets, Vlorë County Albania’s western lowlands and coastal cities such as Durrës , Vlorë , Fier , and Sarandë have a hot-summer Mediterranean climate Csa , typified by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. However, this region diverges from the typical Mediterranean pattern in several key ways. Annual precipitation is notably high—around 1000 – 1200 mm —mainly concentrated in winter, and many areas only narrowly meet the summer dryness threshold needed to avoid a humid subtropical Cfa classification. Adding to this climatic complexity, occasional cold air outbreaks from the Albanian interior can lead to rare but sharp cold snaps, sometimes freezing canals and water pipes an unusual trait for Csa climates and more characteristic of Continental zones . These events have become increasingly rare in recent years but reflect Albania’s transitional geographic position. Moving inland and to higher elevations, rainfall becomes more evenly distributed throughout the year, gradually shifting away from the pronounced seasonality of the coastal Mediterranean zone.

Csb:Warm-Summer Mediterranean Erseka, Kolonja The Csb climate in Albania is found across a range of lower mountain slopes, foothills, and upland basins that transition between the coastal Csa zones and more continental interior climates. While prominent in areas such as the hills above Berat , Tepelenë , and parts of Vlorë County , this climate type is equally widespread in inland and eastern regions of Southern Albania including Kolonjë , Pogradec , Skrapar , and Librazhd , often forming a fragmented but recognizable belt shaped by elevation, exposure, and sheltered topography. Summers are warm but distinctly milder than in the lowlands, while winters are cool and wet.

Orographic uplift drives high precipitation on many western-facing slopes, with annual totals frequently surpassing 1500 mm . However, within this zone, precipitation patterns and totals vary considerably: in more inland or leeward basins , yearly values may fall to between 700 and 900 mm —making these the driest regions of Albania, yet still wetter than notoriously rainy cities such as London or Amsterdam . As one moves further inland, the classic Mediterranean seasonal rhythm fades: while winter generally remains the wettest season, precipitation becomes more evenly distributed, and summer dryness progressively diminishes. Many of these areas lie near the climatic thresholds of Cfb , Dfb , or Dsb classifications, and interannual variability often causes them to fluctuate between types. In colder or drier years, certain locations may fulfill Dsb criteria entirely, while in other periods they fit squarely within Csb norms—underscoring the transitional and highly dynamic nature of these upland climates. One of the most striking features of Albania’s Csb zones is their capacity for winter cold. While cold air outbreaks occasionally reach the Csa lowlands, they strike the Csb belt with greater frequency and severity—especially in elevated basins such as Ersekë , where temperatures have fallen as low as –26 °C and prolonged cold spells between –20 °C and –10 °C are not uncommon. These extremes, rarely associated with Mediterranean-classified climates, reveal the sharply continental undertone that defines much of Albania’s upland terrain. As a result, the country’s Csb regions represent one of the most climatically marginal and variable expressions of the Mediterranean type—positioned at the boundary of multiple classifications and shaped by a powerful convergence of maritime patterns, mountainous complexity, and continental force.

Cfa:Humid Subtropical Buna river, near Shkodër The Cfa:humid subtropical climate in Albania is found across various low-lying regions, including much of the central and eastern lowlands such as the Tirana Basin and the Elbasan Valley as well as certain sheltered valleys, parts of the northern plains, and stretches of the Shkumbin , Devoll , and Mat river corridors. These areas experience hot, humid summers and mild, wet winters . Summer temperatures frequently exceed 30°C in July and August , while winter temperatures occasionally drop below freezing.

Annual precipitation is high and fairly evenly distributed throughout the year , driven by moist Adriatic air masses and frequent convective activity during the warmer months. Sudden torrential downpours of great intensity are common, especially in summer, contributing to the overall precipitation totals. However, in areas closer to the Csa and Csb zones, the rainfall pattern still leans toward a more Mediterranean rhythm, with wetter winters and comparatively drier summers. The low elevation and sheltered terrain of these regions allow for significant heat retention, enhancing their subtropical character. Like adjacent Mediterranean zones, Cfa areas are also vulnerable to cold air outbreaks from the interior, and depending on local topography, may experience cold snaps of equal or even greater severity. Unlike the Mediterranean zones, which tend to be structured around wet and dry seasons, Albania’s Cfa regions are among the country’s many climate types that exhibit four genuinely distinct seasons, with clear transitions between spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Though shaped by different geographic and atmospheric dynamics, Albania’s Cfa zones show notable climatic parallels to parts of eastern China and northeastern Argentina such as the area around Buenos Aires where hot, humid summers and cool, damp winters define a distinctly humid subtropical environment.

Cfb:Temperate Oceanic Gjallica, Kukës The Cfb:Temperate Oceanic climate in Albania predominates across low to moderately elevated hilly regions, forming a broad, near-continuous climatic corridor that extends from the northern uplands through central interior zones and into the southeastern highlands. This belt typically occupies a transitional altitudinal tierpositioned above the humid subtropical Cfa lowland zones and below the colder humid continental Dfb climates found at higher elevations or in more interior locations with reduced maritime influence reflecting a finely layered vertical climatic structure shaped not only by elevation but also by precipitation patterns, continentality, and exposure to prevailing westerly winds. The distribution of this climate type is particularly pronounced in areas such as Tirana County ’s hilly interior, the uplands of Korce County including the Devoll basin , and the Pukë District , where terrain and airflow conditions consistently support mild, moist conditions. In southern Albania, it may also occur at higher elevations in sheltered inland valleys where proximity to the coast is limited and rainfall totals remain high—yielding a fully humid Cfb regime even in zones that might otherwise tend toward Mediterranean Csb classification. Though largely continuous, a few isolated pockets of Cfb climate are also found within otherwise Csa dominated regions, where local topographic and microclimatic factors enable its persistence.

Annual precipitation in these areas generally ranges from 1400 mm to over 2000 mm , with especially high totals on exposed western slopes , supporting stable humidity and temperate conditions throughout the year. Summers are characteristically mild, with average highs between 18 °C and 24 °C , rarely exceeding 27 °C , while winters are cool, averaging –2 °C to –5 °C at night, with occasional colder extremes below –10 °C in enclosed or elevated areas. Seasonal rainfall distribution varies subtly by region: zones nearer the coast may show a mild winter maximum, while inland areas tend toward a more uniform annual pattern. The breadth and continuity of the Cfb climate across Albania’s upland terrain underscore the intricate interplay of topography, moisture transport, and atmospheric circulation, which together contribute to the country’s unusually diverse climatic and ecological landscape.

Dfb:Warm-Summer Humid Continental Novosej, Kukës The Dfb climate in Albania—classified as humid continental with warm summers —forms a relatively continuous inland belt extending from the northern Albanian Alps through the central highlands to the southeastern mountains. It is generally found at elevations above 700 – 800m covering large parts of Kukës , Dibër , and Korçë counties, as well as surrounding upland regions. Though geographically close to the Mediterranean Sea , these interior highlands lie in a zone of moderate northern latitude (centered around 42°N), where elevation, complex terrain, and inland exposure give rise to a distinctly continental climate .The typical seasonal profile includes long, cold winters and short, cool to mild summers. While this broad pattern is consistent throughout the Dfb zone, however there are local variations. In the western margins, including the Mati Highlands and nearby uplands, residual maritime influence is reflected in slightly milder winters and a modest winter precipitation maximum . Moving farther inland and deeper into the mountainous interior, the climate becomes increasingly continental, with colder winter regimes, longer-lasting snow cover, and more evenly distributed or spring-peaking precipitation patterns.

Most of Albania’s Dfb humid continental zones experience a coldest-month average below –3 °C , reflecting the generally cold winters typical of the country’s interior and upland regions. Minimum temperatures often fall between –10 °C and –15 °C , with values below –20 °C regularly occurring during major continental cold spells, particularly in exposed valleys and basins.

Valbona Valley, Kukës Although cold extremes occur throughout these areas, there is notable regional variation in their consistency and severity.

Northern Albania , especially parts of Kukës County , tends to experience more persistently cold winters, with sub –20 °C temperatures being relatively common. A prominent example is Vermosh , Albania’s northernmost settlement, which has recorded lows as severe as –29 °C .

[ 3 ] Southeastern Albania, by contrast, generally experiences milder winter conditions on average. However, during strong cold-air outbreaks from Eastern Europe and Siberia , this region can rival the north in terms of extremes. Numerous settlements in the Korçë uplands such as Shtyllë –29 °C , Voskopoje –27 °C , and Sheqeras –25 °C have reached exceptionally low temperatures, highlighting the region’s vulnerability to episodic deep freezes despite its overall gentler winter climate.The lowest reliably recorded temperature in an inhabited Albanian settlement, –34.7 °C , was measured in Bizë , a highland village in Tirana County located in the cold-prone north eastern part of the county.

[ 4 ] These elevated basins not only trap cold air but also act as sources of cold-air drainage, where dense air descends into adjacent lowlands during major cold episodes. This process occasionally drives sharp temperature drops in otherwise milder parts of the country, reinforcing the reach and influence of Albania’s interior continental climate during winter.

Road to Theth Precipitation within Albania’s Dfb zone varies significantly across its extent, influenced by a complex interplay of altitude , latitude , and local topography . In the north and northwest, particularly in the deeply incised valleys of the Albanian Alps such as Theth , Valbonë , and Bogë , annual precipitation reaches 2500 to 3500 mm among the highest recorded for any Dfb climate globally accompanied by over 190 days of measurable precipitation per year. These conditions are largely driven by strong orographic lift and frequent exposure to moist air masses. In contrast, other parts of the zone especially interior basins and plateaus receive more moderate precipitation totals, generally between 1200 and 1600 mm , aligning with the humid continental average. In southeastern Albania, particularly in the rain shadow of the central and eastern mountains, precipitation decreases further, and the seasonal pattern begins to shift toward drier summers. In these areas, the Dfb climate gradually gives way to Dsb or Dsc variants, reflecting continued cold winters but reduced warm-season precipitation.Elsewhere along its margins, the Dfb zone most commonly transitions into Cfb:Temperate oceanic climate, especially in mid-altitude valleys and areas with more balanced seasonal temperatures and precipitation. In lower elevations with warmer summer conditions, it borders Cfa:humid subtropical climate , while in select interior uplands or western-facing slopes, limited contact zones with Csa or Csb (hot- and warm-summer Mediterranean climates) appear, particularly where summer drying becomes more distinct. These transitions reflect the tight climatic gradients shaped by Albania’s rugged relief and proximity to both continental and maritime airflows.

Overview [ edit ] The lowlands have mild winters, averaging about 8 °C (46 °F). Humidity is mostly high with lots of rain. Mountainous regions have many snow days. 
Summer temperatures average 33 °C (91 °F), humidity is low. Many times, local thunderstorms occur in mountainous regions, characterized by heavy local downpours and strong local winds.

Inland temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Low winter temperatures in the mountains are caused by the continental air mass that dominates the weather in Eastern Europe and the Balkans . Northerly and northeasterly winds blow much of the time. From October to April, when a low pressure comes from the west, the Sirocco wind blows. The low pressure pulls warm and dry air from Sahara. When this air mass goes above the Mediterranean Sea, it fills up with moisture and makes rainy and warm conditions in Albania and in other places in Southern Europe. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas in mountainous areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and river valleys are very high, but the nights are almost always cool. Lowlands are hot and dry in summer. In lowlands the day sea wind blows at day and night land wind at night. Rain is getting rarer in these areas in summer.

Average precipitation is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the Mediterranean Sea and the continental air mass. Because they usually meet at the point where the terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the central uplands. Vertical currents initiated when the Mediterranean air is uplifted also cause frequent thunderstorms. Many of these storms are accompanied by high local winds and torrential downpours.
When the continental air mass is weak, Mediterranean winds drop their moisture farther inland. When there is a dominant continental air mass, cold air spills onto the lowland areas, which occurs most frequently in the winter. Because the season's lower temperatures damage olive trees and citrus fruits, groves and orchards are restricted to sheltered places with southern and western exposures, even in areas with high average winter temperatures.

Lowland rainfall averages from 1,000 millimeters (39.37 in) to more than 1,500 millimeters (59.06 in) annually, with the higher levels in the north. Nearly 95% of the rain falls in the winter.

Rainfall in the upland mountain ranges is heavier. Adequate records are not available, and estimates vary widely, but annual averages are probably about 1,800 millimeters (70.87 in) and are as high as 2,550 millimeters (100.39 in) in some northern areas. The seasonal variation is not quite as great in the coastal area.

The higher inland mountains receive less precipitation than the intermediate uplands. Terrain differences cause wide local variations, but the seasonal distribution is the most consistent of any area.
