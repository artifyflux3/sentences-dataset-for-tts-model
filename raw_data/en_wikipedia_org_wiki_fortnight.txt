For the video game, see Fortnite . For other uses, see Fortnight (disambiguation) .

A fortnight is a unit of time equal to 14 days (two weeks ). The word derives from the Old English term fēowertīene niht , meaning " fourteen nights " (or "fourteen days", since the Anglo-Saxons counted by nights).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Astronomy and tides Further information: Eclipse cycle In astronomy , a lunar fortnight is half a lunar synodic month , which is equivalent to the mean period between a full moon and a new moon (and vice versa). This is equal to 14.77 days.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] It gives rise to a lunar fortnightly tidal constituent (see: Long-period tides ).

Analogs and translations In many languages, there is no single word for a two-week period, and the equivalent terms "two weeks", "14 days", or "15 days" ( counting inclusively ) have to be used.

Celtic languages : in Welsh , the term pythefnos , meaning "15 nights", is used. This is in keeping with the Welsh term for a week, which is wythnos ("eight nights").

[ 5 ] In Irish , the term is coicís .

Similarly, in Greek , the term δεκαπενθήμερο ( dekapenthímero ), meaning "15 days", is used.

The Hindu calendar uses the Sanskrit word पक्ष "pakṣa", meaning one half of a lunar month , which is between 14 and 15 solar days.

In Romance languages there are the terms quincena (or quince días ) in Galician and Spanish , quinzena or quinze dies in Catalan and quinze dias or quinzena in Portuguese , quindicina [ citation needed ] in Italian , quinze jours or quinzaine in French , and chenzină in Romanian , all meaning "a grouping of 15".

Semitic languages have a "doubling suffix ". When added at the end of the word for "week" it changes the meaning to "two weeks". In Hebrew , the single-word שבועיים ( shvu′ayim ) means exactly "two weeks". Also in Arabic , by adding the common dual suffix to the word for "week", أسبوع , the form أسبوعين ( usbu′ayn ), meaning "two weeks", is formed.

Slavic languages : in Czech the terms čtrnáctidenní and dvoutýdenní have the same meaning as "fortnight".

[ 6 ] In Ukrainian , the term два тижні is used in relation to "biweekly, two weeks".
