 You deserve an explanation 

August 18: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Monday, August 18, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

**Two-point tensors**, or **double vectors**, are [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor")-like quantities which transform as [Euclidean vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") with respect to each of their indices. They are used in [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics "Continuum mechanics") to transform between reference ("material") and present ("configuration") coordinates.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-point_tensor#cite_note-1) Examples include the [deformation gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_gradient "Deformation gradient") and the first [Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piola%E2%80%93Kirchhoff_stress_tensor "Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor").

As with many applications of tensors, [Einstein summation notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_summation_notation "Einstein summation notation") is frequently used. To clarify this notation, capital indices are often used to indicate reference coordinates and lowercase for present coordinates. Thus, a two-point tensor will have one capital and one lower-case index; for example, _A jM_.

Continuum mechanics
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two-point_tensor&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Continuum mechanics")]

A conventional tensor can be viewed as a transformation of vectors in one coordinate system to other vectors in the same coordinate system. In contrast, a two-point tensor transforms vectors from one coordinate system to another. That is, a conventional tensor,

Q=Q p q(e p⊗e q){\displaystyle \mathbf {Q} =Q_{pq}(\mathbf {e} _{p}\otimes \mathbf {e} _{q})}![Image 36: {\displaystyle \mathbf {Q} =Q_{pq}(\mathbf {e} _{p}\otimes \mathbf {e} _{q})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c49f1e121a7cbd5248134b03b11187fc3b1b1ec2),
[actively transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_transformation "Active transformation") a vector **u** to a vector **v** such that

v=Q u{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {Q} \mathbf {u} }![Image 37: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {Q} \mathbf {u} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c7e081a102791eb875f5bb3cb534fe4f3c2e534)
where **v** and **u** are measured in the same space and their coordinates representation is with respect to the same basis (denoted by the "_e_").

In contrast, a two-point tensor, **G** will be written as

G=G p q(e p⊗E q){\displaystyle \mathbf {G} =G_{pq}(\mathbf {e} _{p}\otimes \mathbf {E} _{q})}![Image 38: {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} =G_{pq}(\mathbf {e} _{p}\otimes \mathbf {E} _{q})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/61ff2e24a14ad549a9bdcad8a1813060d8bbd989)
and will transform a vector, **U**, in _**E**_ system to a vector, **v**, in the **e** system as

v=G U{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {GU} }![Image 39: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {GU} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/788e29a04d6ecba10bf16f9e4c1ddcfd950d6dd1).

The transformation law for two-point tensor
-------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two-point_tensor&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: The transformation law for two-point tensor")]

Suppose we have two coordinate systems one primed and another unprimed and a vectors' components transform between them as

v p′=Q p q v q{\displaystyle v'_{p}=Q_{pq}v_{q}}![Image 40: {\displaystyle v'_{p}=Q_{pq}v_{q}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/520050736c2e45d747b5ec51a616c3784ab6d520).
For tensors suppose we then have

T p q(e p⊗e q){\displaystyle T_{pq}(e_{p}\otimes e_{q})}![Image 41: {\displaystyle T_{pq}(e_{p}\otimes e_{q})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e6e2e5b8a5d447ca719575124e959590dc49afaf).
A tensor in the system e i{\displaystyle e_{i}}![Image 42: {\displaystyle e_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ebdc3a9cb1583d3204eff8918b558c293e0d2cf3). In another system, let the same tensor be given by

T p q′(e p′⊗e q′){\displaystyle T'_{pq}(e'_{p}\otimes e'_{q})}![Image 43: {\displaystyle T'_{pq}(e'_{p}\otimes e'_{q})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b3ed2c0c4ad9fc09facca725a151ed44a09a9ae).
We can say

T i j′=Q i p Q j r T p r{\displaystyle T'_{ij}=Q_{ip}Q_{jr}T_{pr}}![Image 44: {\displaystyle T'_{ij}=Q_{ip}Q_{jr}T_{pr}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e399c0e3145be685016e94f9e2713e7c41b63de8).
Then

T′=Q T Q T{\displaystyle T'=QTQ^{\mathsf {T}}}![Image 45: {\displaystyle T'=QTQ^{\mathsf {T}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87ec398682b478ef4b6f0512c5668abdb258f12e)
is the routine tensor transformation. But a two-point tensor between these systems is just

F p q(e p′⊗e q){\displaystyle F_{pq}(e'_{p}\otimes e_{q})}![Image 46: {\displaystyle F_{pq}(e'_{p}\otimes e_{q})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ace6c1cc90ec0bf3c09db0662ebcbddef0da2e6f)
which transforms as

F′=Q F{\displaystyle F'=QF}![Image 47: {\displaystyle F'=QF}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9fa016633f2d8f28b29f79fe89977aa5b634210e).

Simple example
--------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two-point_tensor&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Simple example")]

The most mundane example of a two-point tensor is the transformation tensor, the _Q_ in the above discussion. Note that

v p′=Q p q u q{\displaystyle v'_{p}=Q_{pq}u_{q}}![Image 48: {\displaystyle v'_{p}=Q_{pq}u_{q}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c89ee8e034608eacc0eefd0a8961716660e8ee94).
Now, writing out in full,

u=u q e q{\displaystyle u=u_{q}e_{q}}![Image 49: {\displaystyle u=u_{q}e_{q}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cd01b82fccd833badafa4ea3d3874e284d9e13a2)
and also

v=v p′e p′{\displaystyle v=v'_{p}e'_{p}}![Image 50: {\displaystyle v=v'_{p}e'_{p}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e2153fba34c7f800ca24d194a0bc256f9dce8f42).
This then requires _Q_ to be of the form

Q p q(e p′⊗e q){\displaystyle Q_{pq}(e'_{p}\otimes e_{q})}![Image 51: {\displaystyle Q_{pq}(e'_{p}\otimes e_{q})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3041add24f5d21ebb083eef4d06516e3e188e09f).
By definition of [tensor product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product "Tensor product"),

(e p′⊗e q)e q=(e q.e q)e p′=3 e p′{\displaystyle (e'_{p}\otimes e_{q})e_{q}=(e_{q}.e_{q})e'_{p}=3e'_{p}}![Image 52: {\displaystyle (e'_{p}\otimes e_{q})e_{q}=(e_{q}.e_{q})e'_{p}=3e'_{p}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/57ad2b48f3a6c8495fd9eab4779299907580c6ab)1

So we can write

u p e p=(Q p q(e p′⊗e q))(v q e q){\displaystyle u_{p}e_{p}=(Q_{pq}(e'_{p}\otimes e_{q}))(v_{q}e_{q})}![Image 53: {\displaystyle u_{p}e_{p}=(Q_{pq}(e'_{p}\otimes e_{q}))(v_{q}e_{q})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0814c735677029bfc3fed09d483188179d761c50)
Thus

u p e p=Q p q v q(e p′⊗e q)e q{\displaystyle u_{p}e_{p}=Q_{pq}v_{q}(e'_{p}\otimes e_{q})e_{q}}![Image 54: {\displaystyle u_{p}e_{p}=Q_{pq}v_{q}(e'_{p}\otimes e_{q})e_{q}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a356de37d40fd45d651614884b2f494e1b538114)
Incorporating (**[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-point_tensor#math_1)**), we have

u p e p=Q p q v q e p{\displaystyle u_{p}e_{p}=Q_{pq}v_{q}e_{p}}![Image 55: {\displaystyle u_{p}e_{p}=Q_{pq}v_{q}e_{p}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9526e45b6c197fd662b0af60e38bc2bb4d17e889).
