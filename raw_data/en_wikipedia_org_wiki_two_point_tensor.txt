They are used in continuum mechanics to transform between reference ("material") and present ("configuration") coordinates.

[ 1 ] Examples include the deformation gradient and the first Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor .

As with many applications of tensors, Einstein summation notation is frequently used. To clarify this notation, capital indices are often used to indicate reference coordinates and lowercase for present coordinates. Thus, a two-point tensor will have one capital and one lower-case index; for example, A jM .

Continuum mechanics [ edit ] A conventional tensor can be viewed as a transformation of vectors in one coordinate system to other vectors in the same coordinate system. In contrast, a two-point tensor transforms vectors from one coordinate system to another. That is, a conventional tensor, Q = Q p q ( e p ⊗ ⊗ e q ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Q} =Q_{pq}(\mathbf {e} _{p}\otimes \mathbf {e} _{q})} , actively transforms a vector u to a vector v such that v = Q u {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {Q} \mathbf {u} } where v and u are measured in the same space and their coordinates representation is with respect to the same basis (denoted by the " e ").

In contrast, a two-point tensor, G will be written as G = G p q ( e p ⊗ ⊗ E q ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} =G_{pq}(\mathbf {e} _{p}\otimes \mathbf {E} _{q})} and will transform a vector, U , in E system to a vector, v , in the e system  as v = G U {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {GU} } .

The transformation law for two-point tensor [ edit ] Suppose we have two coordinate systems one primed and another unprimed and a vectors' components transform between them as v p ′ = Q p q v q {\displaystyle v'_{p}=Q_{pq}v_{q}} .

For tensors suppose we then have T p q ( e p ⊗ ⊗ e q ) {\displaystyle T_{pq}(e_{p}\otimes e_{q})} .

A tensor  in the system e i {\displaystyle e_{i}} . In another system, let the same tensor be given by T p q ′ ( e p ′ ⊗ ⊗ e q ′ ) {\displaystyle T'_{pq}(e'_{p}\otimes e'_{q})} .

We can say T i j ′ = Q i p Q j r T p r {\displaystyle T'_{ij}=Q_{ip}Q_{jr}T_{pr}} .

Then T ′ = Q T Q T {\displaystyle T'=QTQ^{\mathsf {T}}} is the routine tensor transformation. But a two-point tensor between these systems is just F p q ( e p ′ ⊗ ⊗ e q ) {\displaystyle F_{pq}(e'_{p}\otimes e_{q})} which transforms as F ′ = Q F {\displaystyle F'=QF} .

Simple example [ edit ] The most mundane example of a two-point tensor is the transformation tensor, the Q in the above discussion. Note that v p ′ = Q p q u q {\displaystyle v'_{p}=Q_{pq}u_{q}} .

Now, writing out in full, u = u q e q {\displaystyle u=u_{q}e_{q}} and also v = v p ′ e p ′ {\displaystyle v=v'_{p}e'_{p}} .

This then requires Q to be of the form Q p q ( e p ′ ⊗ ⊗ e q ) {\displaystyle Q_{pq}(e'_{p}\otimes e_{q})} .

By definition of tensor product , ( e p ′ ⊗ ⊗ e q ) e q = ( e q .

e q ) e p ′ = 3 e p ′ {\displaystyle (e'_{p}\otimes e_{q})e_{q}=(e_{q}.e_{q})e'_{p}=3e'_{p}} 1 So we can write u p e p = ( Q p q ( e p ′ ⊗ ⊗ e q ) ) ( v q e q ) {\displaystyle u_{p}e_{p}=(Q_{pq}(e'_{p}\otimes e_{q}))(v_{q}e_{q})} Thus u p e p = Q p q v q ( e p ′ ⊗ ⊗ e q ) e q {\displaystyle u_{p}e_{p}=Q_{pq}v_{q}(e'_{p}\otimes e_{q})e_{q}} Incorporating ( 1 ), we have u p e p = Q p q v q e p {\displaystyle u_{p}e_{p}=Q_{pq}v_{q}e_{p}} .
