It was established in 1979 as Cell Biophysics with Nicholas Catsimpoolas as founding editor-in-chief , obtaining its current name in 1996. The journal is published by Springer Science+Business Media and the editor-in-chief is Lawrence J. Berliner ( University of Denver ).

Abstracting and indexing [ edit ] The journal is abstracted and indexed in: AGRICOLA BIOSIS Previews [ 1 ] Chemical Abstracts Service [ 2 ] CSA Environmental Sciences Elsevier Biobase EMBASE [ 3 ] EMBiology Index Medicus / MEDLINE / PubMed [ 4 ] Inspec [ 5 ] Referativnyi Zhurnal Science Citation Index Expanded [ 1 ] Scopus [ 6 ] According to the Journal Citation Reports , the journal has a 2020 impact factor of 2.194.

[ 7 ] Peer review problems [ edit ] In March 2015 the publisher placed the journal on hold after a pattern of "inappropriate and compromised peer review" was uncovered.
