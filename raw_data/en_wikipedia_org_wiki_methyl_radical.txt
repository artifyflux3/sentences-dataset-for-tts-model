 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

Chemical compound

**Methyl radical** is an [organic compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound "Organic compound") with the [chemical formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula "Chemical formula")CH•

3 (also written as [CH

3]•). It is a metastable colourless gas, which is mainly produced _in situ_ as a precursor to other hydrocarbons in the petroleum cracking industry. It can act as either a strong [oxidant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidant "Oxidant") or a strong [reductant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductant "Reductant"), and is quite corrosive to metals.

Chemical properties
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methyl_radical&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Chemical properties")]

Its first ionization potential (yielding the [methenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methenium "Methenium") ion, CH+

3) is 9.837±0.005[eV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt "Electronvolt").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_radical#cite_note-Golob-2)

### Redox behaviour

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methyl_radical&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Redox behaviour")]

The carbon centre in methyl can bond with electron-donating molecules by reacting:

CH•

3 + R• → RCH

3
Because of the capture of the nucleophile (R•), methyl has oxidising character. Methyl is a strong oxidant with organic chemicals. However, it is equally a strong reductant with chemicals such as water. It does not form aqueous solutions, as it reduces water to produce [methanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol "Methanol") and elemental hydrogen:

2 CH•

3 + 2 H

2 O → 2 CH

3 OH + H

2

### Structure

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methyl_radical&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Structure")]

The [molecular geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_geometry "Molecular geometry") of the methyl radical is [trigonal planar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonal_planar_molecular_geometry "Trigonal planar molecular geometry") (bond angles are 120°), although the energy cost of distortion to a [pyramidal geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonal_pyramidal_molecular_geometry "Trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry") is small. All other electron-neutral, non-conjugated alkyl radicals are pyramidalized to some extent, though with very small inversion barriers. For instance, the [_t_-butyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Butyl "T-Butyl") radical has a bond angle of 118° with a 0.7 kcal/mol (2.9 kJ/mol) barrier to [pyramidal inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidal_inversion "Pyramidal inversion"). On the other hand, substitution of hydrogen atoms by more electronegative substituents leads to radicals with a strongly pyramidal geometry (112°), such as the [trifluoromethyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoromethyl "Trifluoromethyl") radical, CF•

3, with a much more substantial inversion barrier of around 25 kcal/mol (100 kJ/mol).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_radical#cite_note-3)

### Chemical reactions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methyl_radical&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Chemical reactions")]

Methyl undergoes the typical chemical reactions of a radical. Below approximately 1,100°C (1,400 K), it rapidly dimerises to form [ethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethane "Ethane"). Upon treatment with an alcohol, it converts to [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane") and either an alkoxy or hydroxyalkyl. Reduction of methyl gives methane. When heated above, at most, 1,400°C (1,700 K), methyl decomposes to produce [methylidyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylidyne "Methylidyne") and elemental hydrogen, or to produce [methylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_radical "Methylene radical") and atomic hydrogen:

CH•

3 → CH• + H

2 CH•

3 → CH•

2 + H•
Methyl is very corrosive to metals, forming methylated metal compounds:

M + _n_ CH•

3 → M(CH 3)_n_

Production

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methyl_radical&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Production")]

### Biosynthesis

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methyl_radical&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Biosynthesis")]

Some [radical SAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_SAM "Radical SAM") enzymes generate methyl radicals by reduction of S-adenosylmethionine.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_radical#cite_note-4)

### Acetone photolysis

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methyl_radical&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Acetone photolysis")]

It can be produced by the ultraviolet photodissociation of [acetone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone "Acetone") vapour at 193 nm:[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_radical#cite_note-Hall1991-5)

### Halomethane photolysis

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methyl_radical&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Halomethane photolysis")]

It is also produced by the ultraviolet dissociation of [halomethanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halomethane "Halomethane"):

CH

3 X → X• + CH•

### Methane oxidation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methyl_radical&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Methane oxidation")]

Further information: [Atmospheric methane §Removal processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane#Removal_processes "Atmospheric methane")

It can also be produced by the reaction of [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane") with the [hydroxyl radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical "Hydroxyl radical"):

OH• + CH 4 → CH•

3 + H 2 O
This process begins the major removal mechanism of methane from the atmosphere. The reaction occurs in the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere") or [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere"). In addition to being the largest known sink for atmospheric methane, this reaction is one of the most important sources of water vapor in the upper atmosphere.

This reaction in the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere") gives a methane lifetime of 9.6 years. Two more minor sinks are soil sinks (160 year lifetime) and stratospheric loss by reaction with •OH, •Cl and •O 1 D in the stratosphere (120 year lifetime), giving a net lifetime of 8.4 years.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_radical#cite_note-Trace_Gases-6)

### Azomethane pyrolysis

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methyl_radical&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Azomethane pyrolysis")]

Methyl radicals can also be obtained by [pyrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis "Pyrolysis") of [azomethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azo_compound#Alkyl_azo_compounds "Azo compound"), CH 3 N=NCH 3, in a low-pressure system.

In the interstellar medium
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methyl_radical&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: In the interstellar medium")]

Methyl was discovered in [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium") in 2000 by a team led by Helmut Feuchtgruber who detected it using the [Infrared Space Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_Space_Observatory "Infrared Space Observatory"). It was first detected in molecular clouds toward the centre of the Milky Way.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_radical#cite_note-ESA2000-7)
