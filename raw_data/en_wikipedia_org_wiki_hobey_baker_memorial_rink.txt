Hobey Baker Memorial Rink Hobey Baker Rink in 2024 Location Princeton, New Jersey Owner Princeton University Operator Princeton University Capacity 2,054 (hockey) [ 1 ] Surface 200x85 ft (hockey) Construction Broke ground 1922 Opened January 5, 1923 Tenants Princeton Tigers ( men's and women's ice hockey) Exterior Scoreboard Hobey Baker Memorial Rink is a 2,054-seat hockey arena in Princeton, New Jersey . It is home to the Princeton University Tigers men's and women's ice hockey teams as well as the venue for club and intramural hockey teams, intramural broomball , figure skating and recreational skating. It is the only ice skating rink on the Princeton University campus.

Description and history [ edit ] The rink is named in honor of former Princeton star Hobart A.H. "Hobey" Baker , '14.  Baker was a football and hockey star who died shortly after World War I.  In December 1921, it was decided to build an on-campus arena for the hockey team, and to name it after Baker.

It is the second-oldest arena still in use in NCAA Division I hockey, behind only Matthews Arena at Northeastern University ; however, Northeastern has only played at Matthews Arena since 1930, giving Princeton the distinction of being the school that has played in its current home the longest.

[ 2 ] After the fire that destroyed University Gymnasium in 1944 the basketball team played at the rink while Dillon Gymnasium was being built.

Renovations [ edit ] While the game experience in the rink is largely unaltered since the building opened, many upgrades and renovations have been performed behind the scenes for players and spectator comfort.

[ 1 ] Efforts to modernize the arena began in the mid-1970s with major improvements including the addition of locker rooms, a skate sharpening room and a stick storage room in 1981, a new scoreboard and lighting improvements in 1984 and a renovation of the roof in 2002.

2016 season saw the introduction of a new sound system in the rink, as well as a team video room, including a smart board and theater-style seating.

[ 1 ] The men's and women's locker rooms were renovated in 2017, and a new scoreboard was installed in 2018.
