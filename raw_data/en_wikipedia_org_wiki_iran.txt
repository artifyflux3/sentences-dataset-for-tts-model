Iran , [ a ] officially the Islamic Republic of Iran ( IRI ) [ b ] and also known as Persia , [ c ] is a country in West Asia . It borders Iraq to the west, Turkey , Azerbaijan , and Armenia to the northwest, the Caspian Sea to the north, Turkmenistan to the northeast, Afghanistan to the east, Pakistan to the southeast, and the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf to the south. Iran ranks 17th globally in both geographic size and population and is the sixth-largest country in Asia. Iran is divided into five regions with 31 provinces .

Tehran is the nation's capital, largest city , and financial center .

A cradle of civilization , Iran was inhabited by various groups before the arrival of the Iranian peoples . A large part of Iran was first unified as a political entity by the Medes under Cyaxares in the 7th century BCE and reached its territorial height in the 6th century BCE, when Cyrus the Great founded the Achaemenid Empire .

Alexander the Great conquered the empire in the 4th century BCE. An Iranian rebellion in the 3rd century BCE established the Parthian Empire , which later liberated the country. In the 3rd century CE, the Parthians were succeeded by the Sasanian Empire , who oversaw a golden age in the history of Iranian civilization . During this period, ancient Iran saw some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanization, religion, and administration. Once a center for Zoroastrianism , the 7th century CE Muslim conquest brought about the Islamization of Iran . Innovations in literature , philosophy , mathematics, medicine , astronomy and art were renewed during the Islamic Golden Age and Iranian Intermezzo , a period during which Iranian Muslim dynasties ended Arab rule and revived the Persian language . This era was followed by Seljuk and Khwarazmian rule, Mongol conquests and the Timurid Renaissance from the 11th to 14th centuries.

In the 16th century, the native Safavid dynasty re-established a unified Iranian state with Twelver Shia Islam as the official religion , laying the framework for the modern state of Iran. During the Afsharid Empire in the 18th century, Iran was a leading world power, but it lost this status after the Qajars took power in the 1790s. The early 20th century saw the Persian Constitutional Revolution and the establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty by Reza Shah , who ousted the last Qajar Shah in 1925. Attempts by Mohammad Mosaddegh to nationalize the oil industry led to the Anglo-American coup in 1953 . The Iranian Revolution in 1979 overthrew the monarchy, and the Islamic Republic of Iran was established by Ruhollah Khomeini , the country's first supreme leader . In 1980, Iraq invaded Iran , sparking the eight-year-long Iran–Iraq War which ended in a stalemate. In 2025, Israeli strikes on Iran escalated tensions into the Iran–Israel war .

Iran is an Islamic theocracy [ d ] governed by elected and unelected institutions, with ultimate authority vested in the supreme leader. While Iran holds elections , key offices—including the head of state and military—are not subject to public vote. The Iranian government is authoritarian and has been widely criticized for its poor human rights record , including restrictions on freedom of assembly , expression , and the press , as well as its treatment of women , ethnic minorities , and political dissidents . International observers have raised concerns over the fairness of its electoral processes, especially the vetting of candidates by unelected bodies such as the Guardian Council . Iran maintains a centrally planned economy with significant state ownership in key sectors, though private enterprise exists alongside. Iran is a middle power , due to its large reserves of fossil fuels (including the world's second largest natural gas supply and third largest proven oil reserves ), its geopolitically significant location, and its role as the world's focal point of Shia Islam . Iran is a threshold state with one of the most scrutinized nuclear programs , which it claims is solely for civilian purposes; this claim has been disputed by Israel and the Western world . Iran is a founding member of the United Nations , OIC , OPEC , and ECO as well as a current member of the NAM , SCO , and BRICS . Iran has 28 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (the 10th-highest in the world ) and ranks 5th in intangible cultural heritage or human treasures.

[ edit ] Map of West Asia in 1872, with Iran/Persia (ruled by the Qajar dynasty ) shaded in pink.

Historically, Iran was commonly referred to as "Persia" in the Western world .

[ 9 ] Likewise, the modern-day ethnonym "Persian" was typically used as a demonym for all Iranian nationals, regardless of whether or not they were ethnic Persians . This terminology prevailed until 1935, when, during an international gathering for Nowruz , the Iranian king Reza Shah Pahlavi officially requested that foreign delegates begin using the endonym "Iran" in formal correspondence. Subsequently, "Iran" and "Iranian" were standardized as the terms referring to the country and its citizens, respectively. Later, in 1959, Pahlavi's son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi announced that it was appropriate to use both "Persia" and "Iran" in formal correspondence.

[ 10 ] A variety of scholars from the Middle Ages , such as the Khwarazmian polymath Al-Biruni , also used terms like " Xuniras " ( Avestan : Xvaniraθa- , transl.

"self-made, not resting on anything else" ) to refer to Iran: "which is the center of the world, [...] and it is the one wherein we are, and the kings called it the Iranian realm ." [ 11 ] History Main article: History of Iran Further information: Timeline of Iranian history Antiquity Further information: Medes and Indo-Iranians Chogha Zanbil is one of the few extant ziggurats outside of Mesopotamia and considered the best-preserved example in the world.

Iran is home to one of the world's oldest continuous major civilizations, with historical and urban settlements dating back to 4000 BC.

[ 12 ] The western part of the Iranian plateau participated in the traditional ancient Near East with Elam (3200–539 BC), and later with other peoples such as the Kassites , Mannaeans , and Gutians . The earliest Iranian peoples began to arrive from Central Asia in the 2nd millennium BCE.

[ 13 ] The Median dynasty ruled the earliest Iranian state.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] In 612 BC, Cyaxares and the Babylonian king Nabopolassar invaded Assyria and destroyed Nineveh , the Assyrian capital, which led to the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire .

[ 17 ] The Medes later conquered and dissolved Urartu as well.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Achaemenid Empire The Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent The Achaemenids united all Persian tribes under Cambyses I . Under his son, Cyrus II , the Achaemenids defeated the Medes and established the Achaemenid Empire , [ 21 ] the largest-ever Iranian state.

[ 20 ] Cyrus II conquered the Lydian and Neo-Babylonian empires, creating an empire far larger than Assyria. Cyrus II's son, Cambyses II ( r.

530–522 BC), conquered the last major power of the region, ancient Egypt , causing the collapse of its twenty-sixth dynasty .

After the death of Cambyses II, Darius I ( r.

522–486) ascended the throne by overthrowing the Achaemenid monarch Bardiya . Darius' first capital was at Susa, and he started the building program at Persepolis . He improved the extensive road system, and during his reign the first recorded mentions are made of the Royal Road , a highway from Susa to Sardis .

[ 22 ] In 499 BC, Athens supported a revolt in Miletus , resulting in the sacking of Sardis. This led to the Greco-Persian Wars , which lasted the first half of the 5th century BC. In the First Persian invasion of Greece , Persian general Mardonius re-subjugated Thrace and made Macedon a full part of Persia.

[ 23 ] Darius' successor Xerxes I ( r.

486–465) launched the Second Persian invasion of Greece . At a crucial moment in the war, about half of mainland Greece was overrun by the Persians, including territories to the north of the Isthmus of Corinth .

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] This was reversed by a Greek victory following the battles of Plataea and Salamis , during which Persia lost its footholds in Europe, and withdrew from it.

[ 26 ] The empire entered a period of decline. From 334 BC to 331 BC, Alexander the Great defeated Darius III ( r.

336–330 BC) in the battles of Granicus , Issus and Gaugamela , swiftly conquering the Achaemanid Empire by 331 BC. Alexander's empire collapsed after his death; his general, Seleucus I Nicator , tried to take control of Iran, Mesopotamia , Syria , and Anatolia . His empire was the Seleucid Empire .

Parthian and Sasanian empires The Arsacids of Parthia , [ 27 ] initially Seleucid vassals, [ 28 ] originated as leaders of the Iranian [ e ] Parni tribe in the northeastern steppes .

[ 31 ] The Parthians gradually challenged Seleucid rule over Iran, eventually securing control through the 142 BC conquest of Babylonia .

[ 27 ] [ 32 ] Although fighting continued, the death of Antiochus VII Sidetes in 129 BC marked the collapse of the Seleucid Empire, [ 32 ] which then lingered on as a rump state in Syria until conquered by the Roman Empire in the 60s BC.

[ 27 ] The Sasanian Empire at its greatest extent c.

620 , under the reign of Khosrow II The Parthian Empire endured for five centuries, but civil wars destabilized it. Parthian power evaporated when Ardashir I revolted against the Arsacids and killed their last ruler, Artabanus IV , in 224 AD. Ardashir established the Sasanian Empire , which ruled Iran and much of Near East before the Muslim conquests of the 7th century AD.

[ 33 ] At their zenith, the Sasanians controlled all of modern-day Iran and Iraq and parts of the Arabian Peninsula , as well as the Caucasus , the Levant , and parts of Central and South Asia .

[ 34 ] The strong economic conditions left by Parthians allowed the Sasanians to build a powerful and distinctive economic state whose reputation spread well beyond its political frontiers and time.

[ 35 ] The Sasanian Empire was characterized by a complex and centralized government bureaucracy and the revitalization of Zoroastrianism as a legitimizing and unifying ideal.

[ 36 ] Medieval period Early Islamic rule and regional resistance After the fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651, the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate adopted many Persian customs, especially the administrative and the court mannerisms. Arab provincial governors were either Persianized Arameans or ethnic Persians; Persian remained the official language of the caliphate until the adoption of Arabic toward the end of the 7th century.

[ 37 ] However, Iran was still not entirely under Arab control; the Daylam region was under the control of the Daylamites , Tabaristan was under Dabuyid and Paduspanid control, and Mount Damavand under Masmughan control. Arabs had invaded these regions several times but the regions' inaccessible terrain prevented a decisive result. The most prominent ruler of the Dabuyids, Farrukhan the Great ( r.

712–728), managed to hold his domains during his long struggle against the Arab general Yazid ibn al-Muhallab , who was defeated by a combined Daylamite–Dabuyid army and forced to retreat from Tabaristan.

[ 38 ] Abbasid revolution and Iranian renaissance The Saffarid dynasty in 900 AD A map of Iranian dynasties in the mid 10th-century Anti-Umayyad insurrections were supported by non-Arab Islamic converts, who were resentful over being relegated to lower social standing. In 747–750, one of these insurrections grew into the Abbasid revolution , in which descendants of Muhammad's uncle, Abbas , overthrew the Umayyads.

[ 39 ] The political authority of the Abbasid caliphs diminished over the course of the 9th and 10th centuries.

[ 40 ] This led to the establishment of several independent Iranian dynasties, [ 40 ] the ousting of Arab rulers from their scattered bastions across the country, and an Iranian cultural renaissance.

[ 41 ] The period between the collapse of Abbasid authority and the conquest of Iran by the Seljuk Turks in the 11th century is referred to as the " Iranian Intermezzo ." [ 41 ] The Iranian Intermezzo saw the rise and fall of several major and minor dynasties.

[ 41 ] Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the Tahirids in Khorasan (821–873); the Saffarids in Sistan (861–1003); and the Samanids (819–1005), originally at Bukhara . The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central Iran to Pakistan. By early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing Iranian faction known as the Buyid dynasty (934–1062). Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian, the Buyids were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad. The Buyids were defeated in the mid-11th century by the Seljuq Turks , who continued to exert influence over the Abbasids. From the empire's inception, the Seljuk rulers minted coins with the title šāhānšāh ( lit.

' King of Kings ' ) in its Persian form, [ 42 ] perhaps adopting it from the Buyids.

[ 43 ] The Seljuk Empire fractured after the death of Ahmad Sanjar in 1157.

The Islamization of Iran was a long process. As Persian Muslims consolidated their rule, the Muslim population rose from approximately 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 90% by the end of the 11th century. Historian Seyyed Hossein Nasr suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers.

[ 44 ] Although Persians adopted the religion of their conquerors, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as Persianization . Arabs and Turks participated in this process.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Mongol invasions See also: Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire and Mongol conquest of Persia and Mesopotamia Territory of the Khwarazmian Empire on the eve of the Mongol conquests , c.

1215 In the early 13th century, the Mongols reached Iran.

[ 48 ] Bukhara was conquered in 1220 [ 49 ] and the Khwarazmian Empire was destroyed.

[ 50 ] During 1220–21 Bukhara, Samarkand , Herat , Tus and Nishapur were razed, and the whole populations were slaughtered. Over the following decades, further conquests followed, culminating in the fall of Baghdad and end of the Abbasid Caliphate 's rule in 1258.

[ 51 ] The Ilkhanate was one of the four major divisions of the Mongol Empire after the death of Genghis Khan After the death of Möngke Khan , the Mongol Empire was fractured by civil war, both over the succession of the next Great Khan and between nomadic traditionalists and the new settled princes of China and the Middle East.

Kublai Khan was eventually universally recognized, but the empire was irreversibly fragmented.

[ 51 ] In much of the southwest of the empire, including Iran, power fell to Hulegu Khan , [ 52 ] who had been made a deputy there under Möngke Khan.

[ 51 ] Hulegu was accepted as a legitimate ruler in Iran and was legitimized through a fatwa issued by the Shia scholar Ali ibn Tawus al-Hilli .

[ 53 ] Iran experienced a cultural renaissance under Ilkhanid rule.

[ 53 ] Ghazan Khan converted to Islam in the late 13th century, turning the state further away from the other Mongol realms.

[ 52 ] After Ghazan's nephew Abu Said died in 1335, the Ilkhanate lapsed into civil war and was divided between several petty dynasties – most prominently the Jalayirids , Muzaffarids , Sarbadars and Kartids . The mid-14th-century Black Death killed about 30% of the country's population.

[ 54 ] Timur and the rise of new powers See also: Timurid conquests and invasions Timur 's empire and his military campaigns Iran remained divided until the establishment of the Persianate Timurid dynasty in 1370. Its founder, Timur (r. 1370–1405), hailed from a Turkified tribe of Mongols.

[ 55 ] After establishing a power base in Transoxiana , Timur invaded Iran in 1381 and eventually conquered most of it. Timur's campaigns were known for their brutality; many people were slaughtered and several cities were destroyed.

[ 56 ] In 1387, Timur ordered the complete massacre of Isfahan , killing 70,000 people.

[ 57 ] The Timurids maintained control of most of Iran until 1452, when they lost the bulk of it to the Qara Qoyunlu , who were conquered in turn by the Aq Qoyunlu 1468.

Uzun Hasan and his successors were the masters of Iran until the rise of the Safavids.

[ 56 ] Early modern period Main articles: Safavid Iran , Afsharid Iran , Zand dynasty , Qajar Iran , Portuguese–Safavid wars , and Ottoman–Persian Wars The Safavid Iran (1501–1722) at its greatest extent The Safavid Empire , founded by Ismail I (r. 1505–1524), is often considered the beginning of modern Iranian history.

[ 58 ] While Safavid Iran predated the concept of the nation-state as such, it established the basis for the modern state of Iran.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] The Safavid dynastic period was one of the most important Iranian history, as it reunified Iran as a cohesive entity under native rule and established Shia Islam as the official religion .

[ 60 ] The Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722, and experienced a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736.

The Safavid state had a complex bureaucratic system of checks and balances, which ensured transparency and prevented fraud. However, this system was intended not to equalize power between branches of government, but to ensure total power of the shah. Legitimized by his bloodline as a sayyid , or descendant of Muhammad, the shah monitored the actions of government officials through reports provided by the superintendent of each department.

Jean Chardin , French merchant and eventual ambassador to Iran, wrote that the Safavid shahs ruled their land with an iron fist and often in a despotic manner.

[ 61 ] The Afsharid Empire at its greatest extent in 1741–1745 under Nader Shah Complex rivalries in the region of Khorasan led to the Afghan Hotak dynasty invading Iran. In 1722, this conflict led to the collapse of the Safavid Empire after the siege of Isfahan .

[ 58 ] [ 62 ] The brief interlude between 1722 and the rise of the Qajar dynasty in 1789–1796 was marked by widespread political turmoil in Iran and several rival attempts to establish power over the country. The Safavids failed to regain power and the Hotaks failed to establish control. The rival Afsharid and Zand dynasties were established by Nader Shah ( r.

1736–1747) and Karim Khan ( r.

1751–1779), respectively.

[ 62 ] Nader Shah and the shifting balance of power See also: Campaigns of Nader Shah Nader Shah has been described as "the last great Asiatic military conqueror," and compared by some historians to Napoleon and Alexander the Great.

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] His numerous campaigns created a great empire that, at its maximum extent, briefly encompassed all or part of modern-day Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Oman, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, the North Caucasus , and the Persian Gulf . However, his military spending had a ruinous effect on the Iranian economy.

[ 65 ] A map of Iran under the Qajar dynasty in the 19th century.

Nader Shah's death was followed by a period of anarchy in Iran as rival army commanders fought for power. Nader's own family, the Afsharids, lost all but a small domain in Khorasan. The Zand family seized control of much of Iran in the 1750s.

[ 66 ] The Zand rulers never proclaimed themselves to be shah s, but as regents of Iran.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] They first staked their claim to power on behalf of the Safavid puppet Ismail III ( r.

1750–1773) and then on behalf of the Iranian people.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] Rise of the Qajar dynasty and foreign interference The Qajar dynasty gradually increased in power as they clashed with the Afsharids and the Zands for control of the land, culminating in Agha Mohammad Shah proclaiming himself ruler in 1789.

[ 68 ] Agha Mohammad defeated the Zand dynasty in 1794 and was officially crowned in 1796.

[ 66 ] [ 68 ] Shortly thereafter, he captured and deposed the Afsharid Shahrokh Shah, reunifying Iran under a single ruler.

[ 68 ] In the 19th century, Iran lost significant territories in the Caucasus to the Russian Empire following the Russo-Persian Wars .

[ 69 ] Meanwhile, Britain became involved in southern Iran to counter Russia's presence in the north, which posed a threat to British India .

[ 70 ] Amid this struggle for power, drought, shifting agricultural priorities, and poor governance culminated in the Great Persian Famine of 1870–1871 . While the death toll is unknown, the famine killed a significant portion of Iran's population; between several hundred thousand and four million Iranians are believed to have died as a result.

[ 71 ] 20th century up to the Iranian Revolution Main article: Pahlavi Iran Constitutional Revolution and the rise of the Pahlavi dynasty Reza Shah Pahlavi with Mohammad Reza Pahlavi at Persepolis The Persian Constitutional Revolution between 1905 and 1911 led to the establishment of an Iranian parliament.

[ 72 ] After the 1921 coup d'état , the Qajar dynasty was replaced with the Pahlavi dynasty .

[ 73 ] The dynasty was founded by Reza Shah , who established an authoritarian government that valued nationalism , militarism , secularism and anti-communism combined with strict censorship and state propaganda .

[ 74 ] Reza Shah introduced many socio-economic reforms, reorganizing the army, government administration, and finances.

[ 75 ] Reza Shah ruled for almost 16 years until 1941, when he was forced to abdicate by the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran .

To his supporters, his reign brought " law and order , discipline, central authority, and modern amenities – schools, trains, buses, radios, cinemas, and telephones." [ 76 ] However, his reign has been characterized as a corrupt police state which provided only surface level modernization.

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] World War II and post-occupation instability Due in part to Nazi Germany's successful invasion of the Soviet Union , the Iranian government expected Germany to win the war and establish a powerful force on the Russian-Iranian border. Iran rejected British and Soviet demands to expel German residents from its borders. In response, the two Allies invaded in August 1941 and easily overwhelmed the weak Iranian army in Operation Countenance . Iran became the major conduit of Allied Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union. The purpose was to secure Iranian oil fields and ensure Allied supply lines through the Persian Corridor . Iran remained officially neutral. Reza Shah was deposed during the subsequent occupation and replaced with his young son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi .

[ 79 ] At the 1943 Tehran Conference , the Allied "Big Three"— Joseph Stalin , Franklin D. Roosevelt , and Winston Churchill —issued the Tehran Declaration to guarantee the post-war independence and boundaries of Iran.

[ 80 ] Mosaddeq and the Shah's rule See also: 1953 Iranian coup d'état Shah and Shahbanou of Iran with US President Jimmy Carter and King Hussein of Jordan in 1977 In 1951, under Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq , the Iranian parliament voted  to nationalize the British-owned oil industry, leading to the Abadan Crisis . Despite British pressure, including an economic blockade, nationalization continued. Mosaddeq was removed from power in 1952 but was quickly re-appointed by the shah, due to a popular uprising in support of the premier. He forced the shah into a brief exile in August 1953 after a failed military coup by Imperial Guard Colonel Nematollah Nassiri .

On 19 August, a successful coup was headed by retired army general Fazlollah Zahedi , aided by the US ( CIA ) [ 81 ] and the British ( MI6 ), known as Operation Ajax and Operation Boot to the respective agencies.

[ 82 ] The coup—with a black propaganda campaign  against Mosaddeq [ 83 ] — forced Mosaddeq from office. Mosaddeq was arrested and tried for treason. Found guilty, his sentence was reduced to house arrest on his family estate while his foreign minister, Hossein Fatemi , was executed.

Zahedi succeeded him as prime minister and suppressed opposition to the shah, specifically from the National Front and the communist Tudeh Party .

From that time until the revolution, Iran was ruled as an autocracy under the shah, with strong American support. Iran initiated economic, social, agrarian and administrative reforms to modernize the country, which became known as the White Revolution . The shah became wildly unpopular among the Iranian people. Daily demonstrations destabilized the region, and the shah established martial law to curb opposition. When hundreds of thousands of protestors persisted, security forces opened fire on the crowds in an incident that became known as Black Friday .

[ 84 ] Islamic Revolution Main article: Iranian Revolution Ayatollah Khomeini returns to Iran after 14 years exile in France on 1 February 1979.

The protests against the Shah grew to include more than 10% of the country; it is rare for revolutions to involve even 1% of a country's population.

[ 85 ] Frustration with the Shah was so great that even secular and leftist groups supported Ayatollah Rohullah Khomeini , the leader of the revolution , despite sharing none of his political positions.

[ 86 ] Under increasing pressure, the Shah eventually fled Iran, charging the interim Regency Council with his duties until a new government was formed.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] Shapour Bakhtiar , the head of the Council, invited Khomeini to return from exile. However, upon return, Khomeini pledged to defeat the interim government led by Bakhtiar and claimed to support free democratic elections. Violence broke out between the two factions, ultimately leading Bakhtiar to flee Iran in disguise.

On 31 March 1979, a referendum was held on whether to transition from a government of monarchy to an Islamic republic . The referendum was approved by a massive margin. It mandated the creation of an assembly to draft the new theocratic constitution, whereby Khomeini became Supreme Leader in December 1979. Iran's modernizing, capitalist economy was replaced by populist Islamic economic and cultural policies. Industries were nationalized, laws and schools Islamized , and Western influence restricted.

[ 89 ] Khomeini, Iran-Iraq War, and leadership transition See also: United States support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War An Iranian soldier with gas mask during the Iran–Iraq War The shah, now out of power, went to the US to seek cancer treatment after other countries denied him entry. Supporters of the revolution feared that this was a step toward a coup to reinstate the Shah's reign. On 4 November 1979, Iranian students seized US embassy personnel , labeling the embassy a "den of spies." [ 90 ] 52 hostages were held for 444 days until January 1981.

[ 91 ] Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein attempted to take advantage of the disorder of the revolution, the weakness of the Iranian military and the revolution's antagonism against Western governments. On 22 September 1980, the Iraqi army invaded Iran at Khuzestan , precipitating the Iran–Iraq War . The attack took revolutionary Iran by surprise. Although Hussein's forces made early advances, Iranian forces pushed the Iraqi army back into Iraq by 1982. Khomeini sought to export the revolution westward into Iraq, especially to the country's Shi'a Arab majority. The war continued until 1988, when Khomeini "drank the cup of poison" and accepted a truce mediated by the UN.

[ 92 ] The war, which ended in a stalemate in 1988, killed approximately 500,000 people.

[ 93 ] During the war, Saddam extensively used chemical weapons against Iranians.

[ 94 ] Khamenei era Further information: Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , Assassination of Qasem Soleimani , 2024 Iran–Israel conflict , and Iran–Israel war On his deathbed in 1989, Khomeini appointed a 25-man Constitutional Reform Council which named Ali Khamenei as the next Supreme Leader, and made changes to Iran's constitution.

[ 95 ] A smooth transition followed Khomeini's death on 3 June 1989. While Khamenei lacked Khomeini's "charisma and clerical standing", he developed a network of supporters within Iran's armed forces and its economically powerful religious foundations .

[ 96 ] Khamenei in 2022 In 1989, President Akbar Rafsanjani concentrated on a pro-business policy of rebuilding the economy, without breaking with the ideology of the revolution. He supported a free market, favoring privatization of state industries and a moderate position internationally. In 1997, Rafsanjani was succeeded by moderate reformist Mohammad Khatami , whose government advocated freedom of expression , constructive diplomatic relations with Asia and the European Union, and policy that supported a free market and foreign investment.

Iranian nuclear program, principalist dominance (2005–2024) The 2005 presidential election brought conservative populist and nationalist candidate Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power. He was known for his hardline views, nuclearization, and hostility towards Israel , Saudi Arabia , the UK, US and other states. He was the first president to be summoned by the parliament to answer questions regarding his presidency.

[ 97 ] In 2013, centrist and reformist Hassan Rouhani was elected president. He encouraged personal freedom, free access to information, and improved women's rights. He improved Iran's diplomatic relations through exchanging conciliatory letters.

[ 98 ] The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was reached in Vienna in 2015, between Iran, the P5+1 ( UN Security Council + Germany) and the EU. The negotiations centered around ending the economic sanctions in exchange for Iran's restriction in producing enriched uranium .

[ 99 ] In 2018, the US under President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal and new sanctions were imposed. This nulled the economic provisions and brought Iran to nuclear threshold status .

[ 100 ] In 2020, IRGC general Qasem Soleimani , the 2nd-most powerful person in Iran, [ 101 ] was assassinated by the US , heightening tensions between them .

[ 102 ] Iran retaliated against US airbases in Iraq , the largest ballistic missile attack ever on Americans; [ 103 ] 110 sustained brain injuries .

[ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Hardliner Ebrahim Raisi lost a presidential bid in 2017, but he ran again in 2021 , succeeding Rouhani.

[ 107 ] During Raisi's term, Iran intensified uranium enrichment , hindered international inspections, joined SCO and BRICS, supported Russia in its Ukraine invasion and restored diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. In April 2024, the Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus killed an IRGC commander.

[ 108 ] [ 109 ] Iran retaliated with UAVs , cruise and ballistic missiles ; 9 hit Israel.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] It was the largest drone strike in history, [ 113 ] biggest missile attack in Iranian history, [ 114 ] its first ever direct attack on Israel [ 115 ] [ 116 ] and the first time since 1991 that Israel was directly attacked by a state force.

[ 117 ] Israel conducted another strike the same month. In May 2024, Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash , [ 118 ] and Iran held a presidential election in June, when reformist and former Minister of Health , Masoud Pezeshkian , was elected.

[ 119 ] [ 120 ] Ayatollah Ali Khamenei with Saudi Arabia 's Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman and Major General Mohammad Bagheri on 17 April 2025 On 1 October 2024, Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh , Hassan Nasrallah and Abbas Nilforoushan . On 27 October, Israel struck Iranian military sites.

[ 121 ] In May 2025, the Iranian government ordered the mass deportation of an estimated 4 million Afghan migrants and refugees who were living in Iran.

[ 122 ] Alleged nuclear breakout attempt, 2025 war Iran's economic struggles, and the weakening of its key allies and proxies since 2023 have left the Iranian government weakened and isolated.

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ] In early 2025, Iran was rapidly advancing its nuclear program.

[ 126 ] Analysts warned such activity exceeded any plausible civilian justification.

[ 127 ] Beginning in April, Iran and the US entered negotiations for a new nuclear agreement, but progress stalled as Iran declared domestic uranium enrichment a red line . In June, IAEA found Iran non-compliant with its nuclear obligations; [ 128 ] in response, Iran announced the activation of a new enrichment facility.

[ 129 ] On 13 June 2025, Israel launched strikes across Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and killing many top members of Iran's military leadership.

[ 130 ] [ 131 ] Iran retaliated with its own missile strikes, and hostilities resulted in a brief direct conflict between the two countries. On 22 June, the US struck the Iranian nuclear facilities of Fordow , Natanz , and Isfahan ; [ 132 ] Iran attacked U.S. bases in Qatar as a result. On 24 June, Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire after insistence from the US.

At different times, influences from neighboring civilizations have been important, and latterly Persian art gave and received major influences as part of the wider styles of Islamic art .

From the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC), the courts of successive dynasties led the style of Persian art, and court-sponsored art left many of the most impressive pieces that remain. The Islamic style of dense decoration, geometrically laid out, developed in Iran into an elegant and harmonious style, combining motifs derived from plants with Chinese motifs such as the cloud-band, and often animals represented at a smaller scale. During the Safavid Empire in the 16th century, this style was used across a variety of media, and diffused from the court artists of the king, most being painters.

[ 553 ] By the time of the Sasanians, Iranian art had a renaissance.

[ 554 ] During the Middle Ages, Sasanian art played a prominent role in the formation of European and Asian mediaeval art.

[ 555 ] [ 556 ] [ 557 ] [ 558 ] The Safavid era is known as the Golden Age of Iranian art.

[ 559 ] Safavid art exerted noticeable influences upon the Ottomans , the Mughals , and the Deccans , and was influential through its fashion and garden architecture on 11th–17th-century Europe.

Iran's contemporary art traces its origins to Kamal-ol-molk , a prominent realist painter at the court of the Qajar Empire who affected the norms of painting and adopted a naturalistic style that would compete with photographic works. A new Iranian school of fine art was established by him in 1928, and was followed by the so-called "coffeehouse" style of painting. Iran's avant-garde modernists emerged by the arrival of new western influences during World War II. The contemporary art scene originates in the late 1940s, and Tehran's first modern art gallery, Apadana, was opened in 1949 by Mahmud Javadipur, Hosein Kazemi, and Hushang Ajudani.

[ 560 ] The new movements received official encouragement by the 1950s, [ 561 ] which led to the emergence of artists such as Marcos Grigorian .

[ 562 ] Architecture Main articles: Iranian architecture and Persian gardens Chehel Sotoun Palace in Isfahan , built during the Safavid Empire with example of a talar , World Heritage Site The history of architecture in Iran dates back to at least 5,000 BC, with characteristic examples distributed over an area from what is now Turkey and Iraq to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and from the Caucasus to Zanzibar.

[ 566 ] [ 567 ] Weaving Main articles: Persian carpet , Tabriz rug , and Ardabil Carpet The Pazyryk Carpet, 400 BC Iran's carpet-weaving has its origins in the Bronze Age and is one of the most distinguished manifestations of Iranian art. Carpet weaving is an essential part of Persian culture and Iranian art . Persian rugs and carpets were woven in parallel by nomadic tribes in village and town workshops, and by royal court manufactories. As such, they represent simultaneous lines of tradition, and reflect the history of Iran, Persian culture, and its various peoples. Although the term "Persian carpet" most often refers to pile-woven textiles, flat-woven carpets and rugs like Kilim , Soumak , and embroidered tissues like Suzani are part of the manifold tradition of Persian carpet weaving.

Iran produces three-quarters of the world's handmade carpets, and has 30% of export markets.

[ 568 ] [ 569 ] In 2010, the "traditional skills of carpet weaving" in Fars Province and Kashan were inscribed to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List.

[ 570 ] [ 571 ] [ 572 ] Within the Oriental rugs produced by the countries of the "rug belt", the Persian carpet stands out by the variety and elaborateness of its manifold designs.

[ 573 ] Carpets woven in towns and regional centres like Tabriz , Kerman , Ravar , Neyshabour , Mashhad , Kashan , Isfahan , Nain and Qom are characterized by their specific weaving techniques and use of high-quality materials, colours and patterns.

The bulk of surviving Persian literature, however, comes from the times following the Muslim conquest in c.

650 CE. After the Abbasids came to power (750 CE), the Iranians became the scribes and bureaucrats of the Islamic Caliphate and, increasingly, also its writers and poets. The New Persian language literature arose and flourished in Khorasan and Transoxiana because of political reasons, early Iranian dynasties of post-Islamic Iran such as the Tahirids and Samanids being based in Khorasan.

Ancient Persian dance was significantly researched by Greek historian Herodotus . Iran was occupied by foreign powers, causing a slow disappearance of heritage dance traditions.

The Qajar period had an important influence on Persian dance. In this period, a style of dance began to be called " classical Persian dance ".

[ citation needed ] ^ "The Factbook puts 'Persian and Persian dialects' at 58 percent, but 51 percent of the population as ethnic Persians, while the Library of Congress states that Persian 'is spoken as a mother tongue by at least 65 percent of the population and as a second language by a large proportion of the remaining 35 percent. The 'Persian' mentioned in the latter report must thus also include Gilaki and Mazi. However, Gilaki and Mazi are actually from a different branch of the Iranian language subfamily than Persian, and could be as such be seen not as dialects, but as distinct languages. Suffice it here to say that while some scholars see categories such as Gilakis and Mazandaranis as referring to separate ethnic groups due to their linguistic traits, others count them as 'Persians' on exactly the same basis."
