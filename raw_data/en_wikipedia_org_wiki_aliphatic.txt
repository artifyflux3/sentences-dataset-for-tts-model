Find sources: "Aliphatic compound" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( October 2022 ) Acyclic aliphatic/non-aromatic compound ( butane ) Cyclic aliphatic/non-aromatic compound ( cyclobutane ) In organic chemistry , hydrocarbons ( compounds composed solely of carbon and hydrogen ) are divided into two classes: aromatic compounds and aliphatic compounds ( / ˌ æ l ɪ ˈ f æ t ɪ k / ; G.

aleiphar , fat, oil). Aliphatic compounds can be saturated (in which all the C-C bonds are single, requiring the structure to be completed, or 'saturated', by hydrogen) like hexane , or unsaturated , like hexene and hexyne .

Open-chain compounds , whether straight or branched, and which contain no rings of any type, are always aliphatic.

Cyclic compounds can be aliphatic if they are not aromatic .

[ 1 ] Structure [ edit ] Aliphatics compounds can be saturated , joined by single bonds ( alkanes ), or unsaturated, with double bonds ( alkenes ) or triple bonds ( alkynes ). If other elements ( heteroatoms ) are bound to the carbon chain , the most common being oxygen , nitrogen , sulfur , and chlorine , it is no longer a hydrocarbon, and therefore no longer an aliphatic compound. However, such compounds may still be referred to as aliphatic if the hydrocarbon portion of the molecule is aliphatic, e.g.

aliphatic amines , to differentiate them from aromatic amines .

The least complex aliphatic compound is methane (CH 4 ).

Properties [ edit ] Most aliphatic compounds are flammable , allowing the use of hydrocarbons as fuel , such as methane in natural gas for stoves or heating; butane in torches and lighters ; various aliphatic (as well as aromatic) hydrocarbons in liquid transportation fuels like petrol/gasoline , diesel , and jet fuel ; and other uses such as ethyne (acetylene) in welding .

Examples of aliphatic compounds [ edit ] The most important aliphatic compounds are: n-, iso- and cyclo-alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons) n-, iso- and cyclo-alkenes and -alkynes (unsaturated hydrocarbons).
