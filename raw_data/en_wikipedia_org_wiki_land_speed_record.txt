For the sport of setting land speed records, see land speed racing . For records by rail vehicles, see railway speed record .

ThrustSSC , driven by Royal Air Force pilot Andy Green , holds the current land speed record at 1,227.986 km/h (763.035 mph) set October 15, 1997.

The land speed record ( LSR ) or absolute land speed record is the highest speed achieved by a person using a vehicle on land. By a 1964 agreement between the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), respective governing bodies for racing in automobiles and motorcycles (two or three wheels), both bodies recognise as the absolute LSR whatever is the highest speed record achieved across any of their various categories.

[ 1 ] While the three-wheeled Spirit of America set an FIM-validated LSR in 1963, all subsequent LSRs are by vehicles in FIA Category C ("Special Vehicles") in either class JE (jet engine) or class RT (rocket powered).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] FIA LSRs are officiated and validated by its regional or national affiliate organizations.

[ 4 ] Speed measurement is standardized over a course measuring either 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) or 1 mile (1.6 km), averaged over two runs with flying start (commonly called "passes") [ 5 ] going in opposite directions within one hour. A new record mark must exceed the previous one by at least one percent to be validated.

[ 6 ] History [ edit ] German AEG railcar in 1903: 210 kilometres per hour (130 mph) Further information: Railway speed record Until 1829 the fastest land transport was by horse. Then, railway speed records were set.

The first automobile record regulator was the Automobile Club de France , which proclaimed itself arbiter of the record in about 1902.

[ 7 ] Ralph DePalma in his Packard '905' Special at Daytona Beach in 1919 The White Triplex in 1928, driven by Ray Keech Different clubs had different standards and did not always recognize the same world records [ 8 ] until 1924, when the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (AIACR) introduced new regulations: two passes in opposite directions (to negate the effects of wind) averaged with a maximum of 30 minutes (later more) between runs, average gradient of the racing surface not more than 1 percent, timing gear accurate within 0.01sec, and cars must be wheel-driven .

[ 9 ] National or regional auto clubs (such as AAA and SCTA ) had to be AIACR members to ensure records would be recognized.

[ 10 ] The AIACR became the FIA in 1947. Controversy arose in 1963: Spirit of America was not recognized due to its being a three-wheeler (leading the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme to certify it as a three-wheel motorcycle record when the FIA refused) and not wheel-driven so the FIA introduced a special jet and rocket propelled class .

[ 11 ] No holder of the absolute record since has been wheel-driven.

In the U.S. and Australia, record runs are often done on salt flats , so the cars are often called salt cars.

[ citation needed ] Women's land speed record [ edit ] Dorothy Levitt , in a 19 kW (26 hp) Napier, at Brooklands , England, in 1908 The FIA does not recognize separate men's and women's land speed records, because the records are set using motorized vehicles , and not muscle-powered vehicles , so the gender of the driver does not matter; however, unofficial women's records have long been claimed, seemingly starting with Dorothy Levitt 's 1906 record in Blackpool , England, and, unlike the FIA and other car-racing organisations, Guinness World Records does recognize gender-based land speed records.

[ 12 ] In 1906, Dorothy Levitt broke the women's world speed record for the flying kilometer, recording a speed of 154 km/h (96 mph) and receiving the sobriquet the "Fastest Girl on Earth". She drove a six-cylinder Napier motorcar , a 75 kW (100 hp) development of the K5, in a speed trial in Blackpool .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In 1963, Paula Murphy drove a Studebaker Avanti to 262 km/h (163 mph) at the Bonneville Salt Flats as part of Andy Granatelli 's attempt on the overall record.

[ 12 ] In 1964, she was asked by the tire company Goodyear to try to improve her own record, which she raised to 364.31 km/h (226.37 mph) in Walt Arfons 's jet dragster Avenger .

[ 12 ] [ 16 ] The rival tire company Firestone and Art Arfons hit back against Goodyear and Walt Arfons when Betty Skelton drove Art's Cyclops to achieve a two-way average of 446.63 km/h (277.52 mph) in September 1965.

[ 12 ] Five weeks later, Goodyear hit back against Firestone with Lee Breedlove .

[ 12 ] While recordkeeping has not been as extensive, a report in 1974 confirmed that a record was held by Lee Breedlove, the wife of then overall record holder Craig Breedlove , who piloted her husband's Spirit of America – Sonic I to a record 496.492 km/h (308.506 mph) in 1965.

[ 17 ] According to author Rachel Kushner , Craig Breedlove had talked Lee into taking the car out for a record attempt in order to monopolize the salt flats for the day and block one of his competitors from making a record attempt.

[ 18 ] In 1976, the women's absolute record was set by Kitty O'Neil , in the jet-powered, three-wheeled SMI Motivator , at the Alvord Desert .

[ 19 ] Held back by her contract with a sponsor and using only 60 percent of her car's power, O'Neil reached an average speed of 825.127 km/h (512.710 mph).

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] On October 9, 2013, driver Jessi Combs , in a vehicle of the North American Eagle Project running at the Alvord Desert, raised the women's four-wheel land speed class record with an official run of 632.40 km/h (392.954 mph), surpassing Breedlove's 48-year-old record.

[ 22 ] Combs continued with the North American Eagle Project, whose ongoing target is the overall land speed record; as part of that effort, Combs was killed, on August 27, 2019, during an attempt to raise the four-wheel record.

[ 23 ] In late June 2020, the Guinness Book of Records reclassified the August 27, 2019, speed runs as meeting its requirements, and Combs was posthumously credited with the record at 841.338 km/h (522.783 mph), noting she was the first to break the record in 40 years.

1963–present (jet and rocket propulsion) [ edit ] Craig Breedlove 's mark of 407.447 miles per hour (655.722 km/h), [ 11 ] [ 41 ] set in Spirit of America in September 1963, was initially considered unofficial.  The vehicle breached the FIA regulations on two grounds: it had only three wheels, and it was not wheel-driven , since its jet engine did not supply power to its axles.  Some time later, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) created a non-wheel-driven category, and ratified Spirit of America ' s time for this mark.

[ 11 ] On July 17, 1964, Donald Campbell 's Bluebird CN7 posted a speed of 403.10 miles per hour (648.73 km/h) on Lake Eyre , Australia.  This became the official FIA LSR, although Campbell was disappointed not to have beaten Breedlove's time.

[ 42 ] In October, several four-wheel jet-cars surpassed the 1963 mark, but were eligible for neither FIA nor FIM ratification.

[ 42 ] The confusion of having three different LSRs lasted until December 11, 1964, when the FIA and FIM met in Paris and agreed to recognize as an absolute LSR the higher speed recorded by either body, by any vehicles running on wheels, whether wheel-driven or not.

... the Fédération Internationale de L'Automobile, which oversees world land-speed record attempts, doesn't recognize separate men's and women's records. ... The Guinness Book of World Records – to which the North American Eagle team submitted Combs's data – appears to be the only record-keeping entity that does recognize gender-separated land-speed records ... The idea of creating a separate, though unofficial, category for women's land-speed records likely originated with Levitt ... Goodyear and Firestone didn't place Murphy, Skelton, and Lee Breedlove in those cars to empower women; they did it instead to market to women ... That the women's land-speed record does not officially exist may be a relic of less enlightened times when men believed women to be inferior and incapable of handling an automobile, but it may also, ironically, serve the interests of gender equality.
