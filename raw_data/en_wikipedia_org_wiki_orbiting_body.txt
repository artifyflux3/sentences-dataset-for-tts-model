Find sources: "Orbiting body" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In astrodynamics , an orbiting body is any physical body that orbits a more massive one, called the primary body . The orbiting body is properly referred to as the secondary body ( m 2 {\displaystyle m_{2}} ), [ 1 ] which is less massive than the primary body ( m 1 {\displaystyle m_{1}} ).

Thus, m 2 < m 1 {\displaystyle m_{2}<m_{1}} or m 1 > m 2 {\displaystyle m_{1}>m_{2}} .

Under standard assumptions in astrodynamics, the barycenter of the two bodies is a focus of both orbits.

An orbiting body may be a spacecraft (i.e. an artificial satellite ) or a natural satellite , such as a planet , dwarf planet , moon , moonlet , asteroid , or comet .

A system of two orbiting bodies is modeled by the Two-Body Problem and a system of three orbiting bodies is modeled by the Three-Body Problem . These problems can be generalized to an N-body problem . While there are a few analytical solutions to the n-body problem, it can be reduced to a 2-body system if the secondary body stays out of other bodies' Sphere of Influence and remains in the primary body's sphere of influence.
