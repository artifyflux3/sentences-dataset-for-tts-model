The isolation of South America allowed for many separate animal lineages to evolve, creating a lot of originality when it comes to South American animal species.

[ 1 ] The isolation of South America had an abrupt end some few million years ago when the Isthmus of Panama was formed, allowing small scale migration of animals that would result in the Great American Interchange which caused many marsupials such as Thylacosmilus to go extinct.

[ 2 ] South America is the continent with the largest number of recorded bird species.

[ 3 ] Additionally, speciation has occurred at a higher rate in South America than in other parts of the world.

[ 1 ] This is likely due to the large amount of land mass close to the equator. The amount of speciation at the equator compared to the rest of the world is much greater.

[ 4 ] Types of fauna [ edit ] Freshwater fish: 2,700 species [ 1 ] Birds: 3,000 species [ 1 ] Mammals Arthropods Most species of arthropods that are found in South America are only found in South America [ 1 ] Most abundant are butterflies [ 1 ] Amphibians and reptiles Tree frogs are one of the most abundant [ 1 ] Images and Examples [ edit ] Four examples of animals in South America appear below: Llama - Mammal - Live in dry, open habitats [ 5 ] - Easily domesticated (used as pack animals) [ 5 ] - Live in herds [ 5 ] Toco toucan - Omnivore [ 6 ] - Lifespan up to 20 years - Lay 2-4 eggs, both parents incubate [ 6 ] - Large bill with serrated edge for capturing and peeling fruit [ 6 ] Piranha - Carnivorous fish [ 7 ] - Mostly scavengers [ 7 ] - Less than 2 feet in size - Most diverse in Amazon River [ 7 ] Jaguar - Cubs live with their mother for 2+ years [ 8 ] - Only big cat in the Americas [ 8 ] - Mostly found in tropical rainforests , but also savannas and grasslands [ 8 ] Sources [ edit ] Patterson, Bryan; Pascual, Rosendo (1968).
