The **ocean** is the body of [salt water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_water "Salt water") that covers approximately 70.8% of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Percentage-8) The ocean is conventionally divided into large bodies of water, which are also referred to as _oceans_ (the [Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific "Pacific"), [Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic "Atlantic"), [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean"), [Antarctic/Southern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean "Southern Ocean"), and [Arctic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean "Arctic Ocean")),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-oed.130201-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-mw.ocean-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:0-11) and are themselves mostly divided into [seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea "Sea"), [gulfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf "Gulf") and [subsequent bodies of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_bodies_of_water#Seawater_bodies "Lists of bodies of water"). The ocean contains 97% of [Earth's water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_distribution_on_Earth "Water distribution on Earth")[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Percentage-8) and is the primary component of Earth's [hydrosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere "Hydrosphere"), acting as a huge [reservoir of heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_heat_content "Ocean heat content") for [Earth's energy budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget "Earth's energy budget"), as well as for its [carbon cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle "Carbon cycle") and [water cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle "Water cycle"), forming the basis for [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate") and [weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather "Weather") patterns worldwide. The ocean is essential to [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life") on Earth, harbouring most of Earth's animals and [protist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist "Protist") life,[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Bar-On_2018-12) originating [photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis "Photosynthesis") and [therefore Earth's atmospheric oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event "Great Oxidation Event"), still supplying half of it.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-13)

[Ocean scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography "Oceanography") split the ocean into vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. Horizontally the ocean covers the [oceanic crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust "Oceanic crust"), which it shapes. Where the ocean meets dry land it covers relatively shallow [continental shelfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_shelf "Continental shelf"), which are part of Earth's [continental crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust "Continental crust"). Human activity is mostly coastal with high [negative impacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_marine_life "Human impact on marine life") on [marine life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life "Marine life"). Vertically the [pelagic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic_zone "Pelagic zone") is the open ocean's [water column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_column "Water column") from the surface to the ocean floor. The water column is further divided into zones based on depth and the amount of light present. The [photic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_zone "Photic zone") starts at the surface and is defined to be "the depth at which light intensity is only 1% of the surface value"[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:12-14): 36  (approximately 200 m in the open ocean). This is the zone where photosynthesis can occur. In this process plants and microscopic [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae "Algae") (free-floating [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton "Phytoplankton")) use light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients to produce organic matter. As a result, the photic zone is the most [biodiverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiverse "Biodiverse") and the source of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean [ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem "Ecosystem"). Light can only penetrate a few hundred more meters; the rest of the [deeper ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea "Deep sea") is cold and dark (these zones are called [mesopelagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopelagic "Mesopelagic") and [aphotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphotic "Aphotic") zones).

[Ocean temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_temperature "Ocean temperature") depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface. In the tropics, [surface temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature "Sea surface temperature") can rise to over 30°C (86°F). Near the poles where [sea ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice "Sea ice") forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2°C (28°F). In all parts of the ocean, deep ocean temperatures range between −2°C (28°F) and 5°C (41°F).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:7-15) Constant circulation of water in the ocean creates [ocean currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current "Ocean current"). Those currents are caused by forces operating on the water, such as temperature and salinity differences, [atmospheric circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation "Atmospheric circulation") (wind), and the [Coriolis effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect "Coriolis effect").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:8-16)[Tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide "Tide") create tidal currents, while wind and waves cause surface currents. The [Gulf Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream "Gulf Stream"), [Kuroshio Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuroshio_Current "Kuroshio Current"), [Agulhas Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agulhas_Current "Agulhas Current") and [Antarctic Circumpolar Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current "Antarctic Circumpolar Current") are all major ocean currents. Such currents transport massive amounts of water, gases, pollutants and heat to different parts of the world, and from the surface into the deep ocean. All this has impacts on the global [climate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_system "Climate system").

Ocean water contains dissolved gases, including [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"), [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide") and [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen"). An [exchange of these gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_exchange "Gas exchange") occurs at the ocean's surface. The solubility of these gases depends on the temperature and salinity of the water.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:9-17) The [carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere "Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere") is rising due to [CO 2 emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2_emissions "CO2 emissions"), mainly from [fossil fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel "Fossil fuel") combustion. As the oceans absorb CO 2 from the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere"), a higher concentration leads to [ocean acidification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification "Ocean acidification") (a drop in [pH value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_value "PH value")).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:10-18)

The ocean provides many benefits to humans such as [ecosystem services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_service "Ecosystem service"), access to [seafood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood "Seafood") and other [marine resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_resources "Marine resources"), and a means of [transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_transport "Maritime transport"). The ocean is known to be the [habitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat "Habitat") of over 230,000 [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species"), but may hold considerably more – perhaps over two million species.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-la.2009-19) Yet, the ocean faces many [environmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues "Environmental issues") threats, such as [marine pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#Marine_pollution), [overfishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#Overfishing), and the [effects of climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans "Effects of climate change on oceans"). Those effects include [ocean warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_warming "Ocean warming"), ocean acidification and [sea level rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise "Sea level rise"). The continental shelf and [coastal waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast "Coast") are most affected by human activity.

Terminology
-----------

Ocean-related terminology varies; this section describes etymology and contemporary usage.

### Etymology

The word _ocean_ comes from the figure in [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"), [Oceanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanus "Oceanus") (; [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): [Ὠκεανός](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BD%A8%CE%BA%CE%B5%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%8C%CF%82 "wikt:Ὠκεανός")_Ōkeanós_,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-20)pronounced[[ɔːkeanós]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Greek "Help:IPA/Greek")), the elder of the [Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titans "Titans") in classical [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology"). Oceanus was believed by the [ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greeks "Ancient Greeks") and [Romans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome") to be the divine personification of an enormous [river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River "River") encircling the world.

The concept of Ōkeanós could have an [Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_religion "Indo-European religion") connection. Greek Ōkeanós has been compared to the [Vedic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic "Vedic") epithet ā-śáyāna-, predicated of the dragon Vṛtra-, who captured the cows/rivers. Related to this notion, the Okeanos is represented with a dragon-tail on some early Greek vases.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-21)

According to [M. L. West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._L._West "M. L. West"), the etymology of Oceanus is "obscure" and "cannot be explained from Greek".[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-22) The use by [Pherecydes of Syros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pherecydes_of_Syros "Pherecydes of Syros") of the form _Ōgenós_ (Ὠγενός)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-23) for the name lends support for the name being a [loanword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword "Loanword").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-24) However, according to West, no "very convincing" foreign models have been found.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-25) A Semitic derivation has been suggested by several scholars,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-26) while [R. S. P. Beekes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._S._P._Beekes "R. S. P. Beekes") has suggested a loanword from the Aegean [Pre-Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Greek "Pre-Greek") non-[Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European "Indo-European")[substrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_(linguistics) "Stratum (linguistics)").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-27) Nevertheless, Michael Janda sees possible Indo-European connections.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-28)

### World Ocean

"World Ocean" redirects here; not to be confused with [ocean world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_world "Ocean world").

The contemporary concept of the _World Ocean_ was coined in the early 20th century by the [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") oceanographer [Yuly Shokalsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuly_Shokalsky "Yuly Shokalsky") to refer to the continuous ocean that covers and encircles most of Earth.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Janin_Mandia_2012_p._20-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-30) The global, interconnected body of salt water is sometimes referred to as the World Ocean, _global ocean_ or _the great ocean_.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Ro_2020-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-autogenerated1-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-UNAoO-33) The concept of a continuous body of water with relatively unrestricted exchange between its components is critical in [oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography "Oceanography").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-spil.42-34)

### Ocean and sea

The terms "the ocean" or "the sea" used without specification refer to the interconnected body of salt water covering the majority of Earth's surface, i.e., the world ocean.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-oed.130201-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-mw.ocean-10) It includes the [Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific "Pacific"), [Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic "Atlantic"), [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean"), [Southern/Antarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean "Southern Ocean"), and [Arctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean "Arctic Ocean") oceans.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-35) As a general term, "the ocean" and "the sea" are often interchangeable.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-36)

Strictly speaking, a "sea" is a body of water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-pri.sea-37) The word "sea" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the [North Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea "North Sea") or the [Red Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea"). There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans, though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as [marginal seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_seas "Marginal seas")) or wholly (as [inland seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_sea "Inland sea")) bordered by land.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-oceanservice.noaa2-38)

From [the middle ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_middle_ages "The middle ages") until 1650, the world ocean was called the "Ocean Sea" (_Mare Oceanum_), but this is not done anymore;[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:15-39) see [§Medieval views of the "Ocean sea"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#Medieval_views_of_the_%22Ocean_sea%22).

History
-------

The concept of the ocean, originally a part of [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology"), has evolved since antiquity into a purely geographical concept. This section is about the history of the concept of "ocean" within [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography"), not about the history of the ocean itself, for which see [§Natural history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#Natural_history).

### Antiquity

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Okeanos_London_1971.11-1.1.jpg/330px-Okeanos_London_1971.11-1.1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Okeanos_London_1971.11-1.1.jpg)

Detail of Oceanus attending the wedding of Peleus and Thetis on an [Attican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attica "Attica")[black-figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-figure "Black-figure")[dinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinos "Dinos") by [Sophilos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophilos "Sophilos"), c. 600–550 BC, [British Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum "British Museum") 971.11–1.1.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-40)

In ancient Greek thought, the term _Ὠκεανός_ (_Oceanus_) referred to a great river or sea that flowed in a circle around the inhabited earth. (For details on the word, see [§Etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#Etymology).) [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer")'s epics describe Okeanos as a mighty river girdling the world's edge, "backflowing" upon itself, literally bounding the Earth and depicted as the rim of [Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles "Achilles")' shield. In these myths, Oceanus was also personified as a Titan deity, a son of Uranus and Gaia.

As geographic knowledge advanced in the classical era, the concept of the ocean began to shift from myth to empirical geography. By the [Hellenistic period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period "Hellenistic period"), Greek explorers had ventured farther, and the old cosmological idea of a neat fresh-water ring-ocean was gradually discarded. The encircling Okeanos was reinterpreted as the actual saltwater expanses known to mariners, notably the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, rather than a literal river boundary. Nevertheless, early Greco-Roman geographers still retained the notion of a singular surrounding ocean in some form. The Roman geographer [Pomponius Mela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomponius_Mela "Pomponius Mela") (1st century AD) wrote that the inhabited world "is entirely surrounded by the Ocean, from which it receives four seas".[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-41) These four inner seas (e.g. the Mediterranean) were thought of as bays or gulfs branching off the encircling Ocean.

However, accumulating discoveries required modifications to this worldview. By the [2nd century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_century "2nd century"), the geographer [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") distinguished _multiple oceans_ on his world maps. Ptolemy identified, for instance, a "[Western Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ocean "Western Ocean")" (_Oceanus Occidentalis_, corresponding to the Atlantic) separate from an Eastern ocean, and other large marine basins.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-42) Still, in common parlance one might simply speak of _"the Ocean"_ to mean the vast western sea; [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar "Julius Caesar"), for example, referred to the Atlantic as _Oceanus_ as if it were the Ocean proper.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-43)

### Medieval views of the "Ocean sea"

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg/250px-T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg)

This T and O map, from the first printed version of [Isidore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville "Isidore of Seville")'s _[Etymologiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymologiae "Etymologiae")_, is surrounded by the MARE OCEANVM (Ocean Sea).

"Ocean Sea" redirects here. For the 1993 novel by Alessandro Baricco, see [_Ocean Sea_ (novel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Sea_(novel) "Ocean Sea (novel)").

Medieval scholars inherited the classical concept of a world ocean and often reinforced it with biblical and classical lore. The Latin term _mare oceanum_ ("Ocean Sea") became standard in medieval writings and maps to denote the great outer sea encircling the three known continents.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:13-44) Manuscript maps like the famous [T-O _mappae mundi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_and_O_map "T and O map") explicitly show the world as a disk of land surrounded by a continuous ring of ocean. In the 7th century, [Isidore of Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville "Isidore of Seville") taught that "the world is like a wheel [...] and the _Ocean_ flowing around it is contained in a circular boundary,"[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-45) beyond which lie the divisions of Asia, Europe, and Africa. This encircling "Ocean Sea" marked the conceptual boundary of the habitable world for medieval Europeans.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:13-44) It was seen an unknown void at the edge of maps, sometimes labeled with sea monsters and legends.

Despite the intellectual awareness (since antiquity) that the Earth is round, medieval geography still effectively placed all known lands in an island-like mass encircled by water. The Atlantic Ocean in particular, stretching west of Europe, was often simply called _the Ocean Sea_. Well into the 15th century, this term persisted. Notably, when [Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") proposed sailing westward, he and his contemporaries spoke of crossing the _Mar Océano_ (Ocean Sea) to reach Asia. The Spanish crown even granted Columbus the title "Admiral of the Ocean Sea";[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-46) this shows how, even into the early [Age of Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery "Age of Discovery"), the ancient notion of a singular encircling ocean was still prevalent.

### Age of Discovery and early modern changes

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg/330px-Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg)

_Universalis Cosmographia_, also known as the [Waldseemüller map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldseem%C3%BCller_map "Waldseemüller map"), dated 1507, was the first map to show the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas") separating two distinct oceans. South America was generally considered the [New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World "New World") and shows the name "America" for the first time, after [Amerigo Vespucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerigo_Vespucci "Amerigo Vespucci")

The great voyages of the late 15th and 16th centuries dramatically expanded European conceptions of the ocean. As explorers ventured beyond the known world-ocean, they encountered _new vast waters_ that demanded naming and distinction. After Columbus opened the way across the Atlantic (the long-feared Ocean Sea), explorers soon realized that there were more oceans. In 1513, [Vasco Núñez de Balboa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez_de_Balboa "Vasco Núñez de Balboa") crossed Panama and beheld an unknown sea to the west, calling it the _Mar del Sur_ ("Southern Sea"). A few years later, [Ferdinand Magellan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan "Ferdinand Magellan")'s circumnavigation definitively linked this "Southern Sea" to the rest of the globe. Upon entering its waters in 1521, Magellan named it the _[Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific\_Ocean "Pacific Ocean")_ (_Mar Pacífico_, "peaceful sea") due to its calm winds at the time. Due to this, the Pacific was recognized as a separate ocean (the largest on Earth) rather than part of an all-encompassing Ocean Sea.

With such discoveries, cartographers and writers increasingly spoke of multiple oceans. The term "[Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean")" (_Oceanus Indicus_) also came into common usage around the early 16th century. It appeared in Latin by 1515,[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-47) referring to the "Eastern Ocean" near India as distinct from the "Western Ocean" (the Atlantic). In other words, once Europeans knew of the route around Africa, they identified an Indian Ocean basin separate from the Atlantic. By the 17th century, the Atlantic itself was no longer equated with the entire outer ocean, but was just one of the world's great oceans. European languages began standardizing the names _Atlantic_, _Pacific_, _Indian_, etc., for these distinct bodies of water. The medieval phrase "Ocean Sea" fell out of use by around 1650,[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:15-39) as people spoke simply of "the ocean" or specific oceans. English writings of the 17th century onward tend to use _ocean_ in the singular for the whole body of saltwater, or pluralize it to discuss the various oceans of the world.

The early modern period also saw the delineation of additional oceans. Navigators probed the far north, giving rise to the idea of a _"Northern Ocean,"_ later called the _[Arctic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic\_Ocean "Arctic Ocean")_ once its polar character was known. Likewise, in southern latitudes, the waters encircling Antarctica came to be referred to as the _Southern Ocean_ (or Antarctic Ocean) in some accounts. By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, European maps clearly demarcated at least four vast oceans: Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic, with the southern polar waters sometimes treated as extensions of the first three or as a separate "Great Southern Ocean" in certain geographies.

### Modern era and the five oceans

[![Image 5: Rotating series of maps showing alternate divisions of the oceans](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/World_ocean_map.gif/500px-World_ocean_map.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_ocean_map.gif)

Maps exhibiting the world's oceanic waters. A continuous body of water encircling [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), the [World/Global Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Ocean "World Ocean") is divided into a number of principal areas. Five oceanic divisions are usually recognized: [Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean"), [Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean"), [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean"), [Arctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean "Arctic Ocean"), and [Southern/Antarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean "Southern Ocean"); the last two listed are sometimes consolidated into the first three.

In modern geography and oceanography, the concept of the ocean has reached a nuanced resolution. On one hand, scientists recognize that all the oceans form one continuous [§World Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#World_Ocean). On the other hand, for practical and historical reasons, it is customary to divide this World Ocean into a set of _five_ major oceans. By convention these are the [Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean"), [Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean"), [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean"), [Arctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean "Arctic Ocean"), and [Southern (Antarctic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean "Southern Ocean") oceans. This five-ocean model only fully crystallized in the early 21st century, when the Southern Ocean, delineated by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, was recognized by various government and international bodies: by the [U.S. Board on Geographic Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Board_on_Geographic_Names "United States Board on Geographic Names") since 1999,[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-48) and by the [International Hydrographic Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Hydrographic_Organization "International Hydrographic Organization") since 2000.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-49)

Natural history
---------------

### Origin of water

Scientists believe that a sizable quantity of [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water") would have been in the material that formed Earth.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-50) Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less massive during its formation. This is called [atmospheric escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape "Atmospheric escape").

During [planetary formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Formation "Earth"), Earth possibly had [magma oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_ocean "Magma ocean"). Subsequently, [outgassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgassing "Outgassing"), [volcanic activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_activity "Volcanic activity") and [meteorite impacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite_impact "Meteorite impact"), produced an early atmosphere of [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"), [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") and [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor "Water vapor"), according to current theories. The gases and the atmosphere are thought to have accumulated over millions of years. After Earth's surface had significantly cooled, the water vapor over time would have condensed, forming Earth's first oceans.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-NOAAs_National_Ocean_Service_2013-51) The early oceans might have been significantly hotter than today and appeared green due to high iron content.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Astrobiology_2017-52)

Geological evidence helps constrain the time frame for liquid water existing on Earth. A sample of pillow basalt (a type of rock formed during an underwater eruption) was recovered from the [Isua Greenstone Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isua_Greenstone_Belt "Isua Greenstone Belt") and provides evidence that water existed on Earth 3.8 billion years ago.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:62-53) In the [Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuvvuagittuq_Greenstone_Belt "Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt"), [Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec "Quebec"), Canada, rocks dated at 3.8 billion years old by one study[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-54) and 4.28 billion years old by another[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-55) show evidence of the presence of water at these ages.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:62-53) If oceans existed earlier than this, any geological evidence either has yet to be discovered, or has since been destroyed by geological processes like [crustal recycling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustal_recycling "Crustal recycling"). However, in August 2020, researchers reported that sufficient water to fill the oceans may have always been on the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") since the beginning of the planet's formation.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-SCI-20200827wu-56)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-SCI-20200827aa-57)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-58) In this model, atmospheric [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas "Greenhouse gas") kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") had [only 70%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faint_young_Sun_paradox "Faint young Sun paradox") of its [current luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_luminosity "Solar luminosity").[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-asp2002-59)

### Ocean formation

The origin of Earth's oceans is unknown. Oceans are thought to have formed in the [Hadean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean "Hadean") eon and may have been the cause for the [emergence of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis "Abiogenesis").

[Plate tectonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics "Plate tectonics"), [post-glacial rebound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound "Post-glacial rebound"), and [sea level rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise "Sea level rise") continually change the [coastline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast "Coast") and structure of the world ocean. A global ocean has existed in one form or another on Earth for eons.

Since its formation the ocean has taken many conditions and shapes with many [past ocean divisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_oceans "List of ancient oceans") and potentially at times covering the whole globe.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Voosen_p.-60)

During colder climatic periods, more ice caps and glaciers form, and enough of the global water supply accumulates as ice to lessen the amounts in other parts of the water cycle. The reverse is true during warm periods. During the last ice age, glaciers covered almost one-third of Earth's land mass with the result being that the oceans were about 122 m (400 ft) lower than today. During the last global "warm spell," about 125,000 years ago, the seas were about 5.5 m (18 ft) higher than they are now. About three million years ago the oceans could have been up to 50 m (165 ft) higher.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:32-61)

Geography
---------

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/World_map_ocean_locator-en.svg/500px-World_map_ocean_locator-en.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_map_ocean_locator-en.svg)

World map of the five-ocean model with approximate boundaries

The entire ocean, containing 97% of Earth's water, spans 70.8% of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")'s surface,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Percentage-8) making it Earth's global ocean or _world ocean_.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Janin_Mandia_2012_p._20-29)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Ro_2020-31) This makes Earth, along with its vibrant [hydrosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere "Hydrosphere") a "water world"[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Smith_2021-62)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-National_Geographic_Society_2022-63) or "[ocean world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_world "Ocean world")",[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Lunine_2017_pp._123%E2%80%93130-64)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Ocean_Worlds-65) particularly in Earth's early history when the ocean is thought to have possibly covered Earth completely.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Voosen_p.-60) The ocean's shape is irregular, unevenly dominating the [Earth's surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_surface "Earth's surface"). This leads to the distinction of the Earth's surface into a [water and land hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_hemisphere "Water hemisphere"), as well as the division of the ocean into different oceans.

[Seawater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater "Seawater") covers about 361,000,000 km 2 (139,000,000 sq mi) and the ocean's furthest [pole of inaccessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_inaccessibility "Pole of inaccessibility"), known as "[Point Nemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Nemo "Point Nemo")", in a region known as [spacecraft cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_cemetery "Spacecraft cemetery") of the [South Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pacific_Ocean "South Pacific Ocean"), at [48°52.6′S 123°23.6′W / 48.8767°S 123.3933°W](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Ocean&params=48_52.6_S_123_23.6_W_type:landmark&title=Point+Nemo). This point is roughly 2,688 km (1,670 mi) from the nearest land.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-66)

### Oceanic divisions

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/World_ocean_map.gif/250px-World_ocean_map.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_ocean_map.gif)

Map of Earth centered on its ocean, showing the different ocean divisions

There are different customs to subdivide the ocean and are adjourned by smaller bodies of water such as, [seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seas "Seas"), [gulfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulfs "Gulfs"), [bays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay "Bay"), [bights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bight_(geography) "Bight (geography)"), and [straits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait "Strait").

The ocean is customarily divided into five principal oceans – listed below in descending order of area and volume:

Oceans by size | # | Ocean | Location | Area (km 2) | Volume (km 3) | Avg.depth (m) | Coastline (km)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-itu-67) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean") | Between [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia") and [Australasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia "Australasia") and the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas")[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-eoe-pac-68) | 168,723,000 _(46.6%)_ | 669,880,000 _(50.1%)_ | 3,970 | 135,663 _(35.9%)_ |
| 2 | [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") | Between the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas") and [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") and [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa")[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-eoe-atl-69) | 85,133,000 _(23.5%)_ | 310,410,900 _(23.3%)_ | 3,646 | 111,866 _(29.6%)_ |
| 3 | [Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean") | Between [southern Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent "Indian subcontinent"), [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa") and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_(continent) "Australia (continent)")[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-eoe-ind-70) | 70,560,000 _(19.5%)_ | 264,000,000 _(19.8%)_ | 3,741 | 66,526 _(17.6%)_ |
| 4 | [Antarctic/Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean "Southern Ocean") | Between [Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") and the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans _Sometimes considered an extension of those three oceans._[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-eoe-sth-71)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-IHO-72) | 21,960,000 _(6.1%)_ | 71,800,000 _(5.4%)_ | 3,270 | 17,968 _(4.8%)_ |

### Ocean basins

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Mid-ocean_ridge_system.gif/500px-Mid-ocean_ridge_system.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mid-ocean_ridge_system.gif)

The ocean fills Earth's [oceanic basins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_basin "Oceanic basin"). Earth's oceanic basins cover different [geologic provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_province "Geologic province") of Earth's [oceanic crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust "Oceanic crust") as well as [continental crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust "Continental crust"). As such it covers mainly Earth's [structural basins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_basin "Structural basin"), but also [continental shelves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_shelves "Continental shelves").

In mid-ocean, [magma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma "Magma") is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form [mid-oceanic ridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-oceanic_ridge "Mid-oceanic ridge") and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as [subduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction "Subduction"). Deep [trenches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_trench "Oceanic trench") are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes, heat is produced and magma is forced up creating underwater mountains, some of which may form chains of [volcanic islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_island "Volcanic island") near to deep trenches. Near some of the boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-76)[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-77)

Every ocean basin has a [mid-ocean ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge "Mid-ocean ridge"), which creates a long mountain range beneath the ocean. Together they form the global mid-oceanic ridge system that features the [longest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountain_ranges#By_length "List of mountain ranges")[mountain range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range "Mountain range") in the world. The longest continuous mountain range is 65,000 km (40,000 mi). This underwater mountain range is several times longer than the longest continental mountain range– the [Andes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes "Andes").[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-78)

[Oceanographers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanographers "Oceanographers") of the [Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Foundation-GEBCO_Seabed_2030_Project "Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project") (Seabed 2030) state that as of 2024 just over 26% of the [ocean floor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_floor "Ocean floor") has been mapped at a higher resolution than provided by satellites, while the ocean as a whole will never be fully explored,[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-k886-79) with some estimating 5% of it having been explored.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-m209-80)

### Interaction with the coast

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/NJ_LBI_Lighthouse_04.JPG/250px-NJ_LBI_Lighthouse_04.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NJ_LBI_Lighthouse_04.JPG)

[Lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse "Lighthouse") at the [coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast "Coast") of [Ocean County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_County "Ocean County"), [New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey "New Jersey"), U.S., facing the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") at [sunrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise "Sunrise")

The zone where land meets sea is known as the [coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast "Coast"), and the part between the lowest spring [tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide "Tide") and the upper limit reached by splashing waves is the [shore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore "Shore"). A [beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach "Beach") is the accumulation of sand or [shingle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingle_beach "Shingle beach") on the shore.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Monkhouse2912-81) A [headland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headland "Headland") is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger [promontory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promontory "Promontory") is known as a [cape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_(geography) "Cape (geography)"). The indentation of a coastline, especially between two headlands, is a bay. A small bay with a narrow inlet is a [cove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cove "Cove") and a large bay may be referred to as a gulf.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-82) Coastlines are influenced by several factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Monkhouse2912-81)

Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute and these are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves as the [swash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swash "Swash") moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. This tends to undercut the cliff, and normal [weathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weathering "Weathering") processes such as the action of frost follows, causing further destruction. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops at the foot of the cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Monkhouse2912-81)

Material worn from the margins of the land eventually ends up in the sea. Here it is subject to [attrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attrition_(erosion) "Attrition (erosion)") as currents flowing parallel to the coast scour out channels and transport sand and pebbles away from their place of origin. Sediment carried to the sea by rivers settles on the seabed causing [deltas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltas "Deltas") to form in estuaries. All these materials move back and forth under the influence of waves, tides and currents.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Monkhouse2912-81) Dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on the coastline. Governments make efforts to prevent flooding of the land by the building of [breakwaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakwaters "Breakwaters"), [seawalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawall "Seawall"), [dykes and levees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee "Levee") and other sea defences. For instance, the [Thames Barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Barrier "Thames Barrier") is designed to protect London from a storm surge,[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-83) while the failure of the dykes and levees around [New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans "New Orleans") during [Hurricane Katrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina "Hurricane Katrina") created a [humanitarian crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis "Humanitarian crisis") in the United States.

### Color

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Season-long_composites_of_ocean_chlorophyll_%288161799575%29.jpg/500px-Season-long_composites_of_ocean_chlorophyll_%288161799575%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Season-long_composites_of_ocean_chlorophyll_(8161799575).jpg)

Ocean [chlorophyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll "Chlorophyll") concentration is a proxy for [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton "Phytoplankton") biomass. In this map, blue colors represent lower chlorophyll and reds represent higher chlorophyll. Satellite-measured chlorophyll is estimated based on [ocean color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_color "Ocean color") by how green the color of the water appears from space.

Most of the ocean is blue in color, but in some places the ocean is blue-green, green, or even yellow to brown.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-84) Blue ocean color is a result of several factors. First, water preferentially absorbs red light, which means that blue light remains and is reflected back out of the water. Red light is most easily absorbed and thus does not reach great depths, usually to less than 50 meters (164 ft). Blue light, in comparison, can penetrate up to 200 meters (656 ft).[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-85) Second, water molecules and very tiny particles in ocean water preferentially scatter blue light more than light of other colors. Blue light scattering by water and tiny particles happens even in the very clearest ocean water,[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-86) and is similar to [blue light scattering in the sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_sky_radiation "Diffuse sky radiation").

The main substances that affect the color of the ocean include [dissolved organic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colored_dissolved_organic_matter "Colored dissolved organic matter"), living [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton "Phytoplankton") with [chlorophyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll "Chlorophyll") pigments, and non-living particles like [marine snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_snow "Marine snow") and mineral [sediments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediments "Sediments").[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Ocean_color_Coble-87) Chlorophyll can be measured by [satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite") observations and serves as a proxy for ocean productivity ([marine primary productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_primary_production "Marine primary production")) in surface waters. In long term composite satellite images, regions with high ocean productivity show up in yellow and green colors because they contain more (green) [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton "Phytoplankton"), whereas areas of low productivity show up in blue.

### Water cycle, weather, and rainfall

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Diagram_of_the_Water_Cycle.jpg/500px-Diagram_of_the_Water_Cycle.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diagram_of_the_Water_Cycle.jpg)

The ocean is a major driver of Earth's [water cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle "Water cycle").

Ocean water represents the largest body of water within the global [water cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle "Water cycle") (oceans contain 97% of [Earth's water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_distribution_on_Earth "Water distribution on Earth")). Evaporation from the ocean moves water into the atmosphere to later rain back down onto land and the ocean.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:3-88) Oceans have a significant effect on the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere"). The ocean as a whole is thought to cover approximately 90% of the Earth's biosphere.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-noaa.gov-89) Oceanic [evaporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation "Evaporation"), as a phase of the water cycle, is the source of most rainfall (about 90%),[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:3-88) causing a global [cloud cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_cover "Cloud cover") of 67% and a consistent oceanic cloud cover of 72%.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-King_Platnick_Menzel_Ackerman_2013_pp._3826%E2%80%933852-90)[Ocean temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_temperature "Ocean temperature") affect [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate") and [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind "Wind") patterns that affect life on land. One of the most dramatic forms of [weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather "Weather") occurs over the oceans: [tropical cyclones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone") (also called "typhoons" and "hurricanes" depending upon where the system forms).

As the world's ocean is the principal component of Earth's [hydrosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere "Hydrosphere"), it is integral to [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life") on Earth, forms part of the [carbon cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle "Carbon cycle") and water cycle, and – as a huge [heat reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_heat_content "Ocean heat content") – influences climate and weather patterns.

### Waves and swell

Movement of water as waves pass

The motions of the ocean surface, known as undulations or [wind waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_wave "Wind wave"), are the partial and alternate rising and falling of the ocean surface. The series of [mechanical waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_waves "Mechanical waves") that propagate along the interface between water and air is called [swell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swell_(ocean) "Swell (ocean)") – a term used in [sailing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing "Sailing"), [surfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing "Surfing") and [navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation "Navigation").[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-91) These motions profoundly affect ships on the surface of the ocean and the well-being of people on those ships who might suffer from [sea sickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_sickness "Sea sickness").

Wind blowing over the surface of a body of water forms waves that are perpendicular to the direction of the wind. The friction between air and water caused by a gentle breeze on a pond causes [ripples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_wave "Capillary wave") to form. A stronger gust blowing over the ocean causes larger waves as the moving air pushes against the raised ridges of water. The waves reach their maximum height when the rate at which they are travelling nearly matches the speed of the wind. In open water, when the wind blows continuously as happens in the Southern Hemisphere in the [Roaring Forties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring_Forties "Roaring Forties"), long, organized masses of water called swell roll across the ocean.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Stow-92): 83–84 [[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-NOAA-93)[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-94) If the wind dies down, the wave formation is reduced, but already-formed waves continue to travel in their original direction until they meet land. The size of the waves depends on the [fetch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetch_(geography) "Fetch (geography)"), the distance that the wind has blown over the water and the strength and duration of that wind. When waves meet others coming from different directions, interference between the two can produce broken, irregular seas.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-NOAA-93)

[Constructive interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_interference "Constructive interference") can lead to the formation of unusually high [rogue waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_wave "Rogue wave").[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-mrgarrison-95) Most waves are less than 3 m (10 ft) high[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-mrgarrison-95) and it is not unusual for strong storms to double or triple that height.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-96) Rogue waves, however, have been documented at heights above 25 meters (82 ft).[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-97)[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-98)

The top of a wave is known as the crest, the lowest point between waves is the trough and the distance between the crests is the wavelength. The wave is pushed across the surface of the ocean by the wind, but this represents a transfer of energy and not horizontal movement of water. As waves approach land and [move into shallow water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waves_and_shallow_water "Waves and shallow water"), they change their behavior. If approaching at an angle, waves may bend ([refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction")) or wrap around rocks and headlands ([diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction "Diffraction")). When the wave reaches a point where its deepest oscillations of the water contact the [ocean floor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_floor "Ocean floor"), they begin to slow down. This pulls the crests closer together and increases the [waves' height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_height "Wave height"), which is called [wave shoaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_shoaling "Wave shoaling"). When the ratio of the wave's height to the water depth increases above a certain limit, it "[breaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_breaking "Wave breaking")", toppling over in a mass of foaming water.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-mrgarrison-95) This rushes in a sheet up the beach before retreating into the ocean under the influence of gravity.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-NOAA2-99)

[Earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake "Earthquake"), [volcanic eruptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_eruptions "Volcanic eruptions") or other major geological disturbances can set off waves that can lead to [tsunamis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunamis "Tsunamis") in coastal areas which can be very dangerous.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-usgstsunami-100)[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-NTWC-physics-101)

### Sea level and surface

The [ocean's surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%27s_surface "Ocean's surface") is an important reference point for oceanography and geography, particularly as [mean sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_sea_level "Mean sea level"). The ocean surface has globally little, but [measurable topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_surface_topography "Ocean surface topography"), depending on the ocean's volumes.

The ocean surface is a crucial interface for oceanic and atmospheric processes. Allowing interchange of particles, enriching the air and water, as well as grounds by some particles becoming [sediments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment "Sediment"). This interchange has fertilized life in the ocean, on land and air. All these processes and components together make up [ocean surface ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_surface_ecosystem "Ocean surface ecosystem").

### Tides

Main article: [Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide "Tide")

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Bay_of_Fundy.jpg/250px-Bay_of_Fundy.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bay_of_Fundy.jpg)

High tide and low tide in the [Bay of Fundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Fundy "Bay of Fundy"), Canada

Tides are the regular rise and fall in water level experienced by oceans, primarily driven by [the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon "The Moon")'s gravitational [tidal forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force "Tidal force") upon the Earth. Tidal forces affect all matter on Earth, but only [fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluids "Fluids") like the ocean demonstrate the effects on human timescales. (For example, tidal forces acting on rock may produce [tidal locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking "Tidal locking") between two planetary bodies.) Though primarily driven by the Moon's gravity, oceanic tides are also substantially modulated by the Sun's tidal forces, by the rotation of the Earth, and by the shape of the rocky continents blocking oceanic water flow. (Tidal forces vary more with distance than the "base" force of gravity: the Moon's tidal forces on Earth are more than double the Sun's,[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-NOAAtides-102) despite the latter's much stronger gravitational force on Earth. Earth's tidal forces upon the Moon are 20x stronger than the Moon's tidal forces on the Earth.)

The primary effect of lunar tidal forces is to bulge Earth matter towards the near and far sides of the Earth, relative to the moon. The "perpendicular" sides, from which the Moon appears in line with the local horizon, experience "tidal troughs". Since it takes nearly 25 hours for the Earth to rotate under the Moon (accounting for the Moon's 28-day orbit around Earth), tides thus cycle over a course of 12.5 hours. However, the rocky continents pose obstacles for the tidal bulges, so the timing of tidal maxima may not actually align with the Moon in most localities on Earth, as the oceans are forced to "dodge" the continents. Timing and magnitude of tides vary widely across the Earth as a result of the continents. Thus, knowing the Moon's position does not allow a local to predict tide timings, instead requiring precomputed [tide tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_table "Tide table") which account for the continents and the Sun, among others.

During each tidal cycle, at any given place the tidal waters rise to maximum height, high tide, before ebbing away again to the minimum level, low tide. As the water recedes, it gradually reveals the [foreshore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreshore "Foreshore"), also known as the intertidal zone. The difference in height between the high tide and low tide is known as the [tidal range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_range "Tidal range") or tidal amplitude.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-oceanservice-103)[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-104) When the sun and moon are aligned (full moon or new moon), the combined effect results in the higher "spring tides", while the sun and moon misaligning (half moons) result in lesser tidal ranges.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-oceanservice-103)

In the open ocean tidal ranges are less than 1 meter, but in coastal areas these tidal ranges increase to more than 10 meters in some areas.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-105) Some of the largest tidal ranges in the world occur in the [Bay of Fundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Fundy "Bay of Fundy") and [Ungava Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungava_Bay "Ungava Bay") in Canada, reaching up to 16 meters.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-106) Other locations with record high tidal ranges include the [Bristol Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Channel "Bristol Channel") between England and Wales, [Cook Inlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Inlet "Cook Inlet") in Alaska, and the [Río Gallegos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%ADo_Gallegos "Río Gallegos") in Argentina.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-107)

Tides are not to be confused with [storm surges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge "Storm surge"), which can occur when high winds pile water up against the coast in a shallow area and this, coupled with a low pressure system, can raise the surface of the ocean dramatically above a typical high tide.

### Depth

The average depth of the oceans is about 4 km. More precisely the average depth is 3,688 meters (12,100 ft).[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-NOAA-93) Nearly half of the world's marine waters are over 3,000 meters (9,800 ft) deep.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-UNAoO-33) "Deep ocean," which is anything below 200 meters (660 ft), covers about 66% of Earth's surface.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-drazen-108) This figure does not include seas not connected to the World Ocean, such as the [Caspian Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea "Caspian Sea").

The deepest region of the ocean is at the [Mariana Trench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench "Mariana Trench"), located in the Pacific Ocean near the [Northern Mariana Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mariana_Islands "Northern Mariana Islands").[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-smmt-109) The maximum depth has been estimated to be 10,971 meters (35,994 ft). The British naval vessel _Challenger II_ surveyed the trench in 1951 and named the deepest part of the trench the "[Challenger Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_Deep "Challenger Deep")". In 1960, the [Trieste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathyscaphe_Trieste "Bathyscaphe Trieste") successfully reached the bottom of the trench, manned by a crew of two men.

### Oceanic zones

[![Image 13: Drawing showing divisions according to depth and distance from shore](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Oceanic_divisions.svg/500px-Oceanic_divisions.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Oceanic_divisions.svg)

The major oceanic zones, based on depth and biophysical conditions 

[Oceanographers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanographers "Oceanographers") classify the ocean into vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The [pelagic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic_zone "Pelagic zone") consists of the [water column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_column "Water column") of the open ocean, and can be divided into further regions categorized by light abundance and by depth.

#### Grouped by light penetration

The ocean zones can be grouped by light penetration into (from top to bottom): the photic zone, the mesopelagic zone and the aphotic deep ocean zone:

*   The [photic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_zone "Photic zone") is defined to be "the depth at which light intensity is only 1% of the surface value".[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:12-14): 36  This is usually up to a depth of approximately 200 m in the open ocean. It is the region where [photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis "Photosynthesis") can occur and is, therefore, the most [biodiverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiverse "Biodiverse"). Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae "Algae") (free floating [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton "Phytoplankton")) allows the creation of organic matter from chemical precursors including water and carbon dioxide. This organic matter can then be consumed by other creatures. Much of the organic matter created in the photic zone is consumed there but some sinks into deeper waters. The pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the _epipelagic_.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:4-110) The actual optics of light reflecting and penetrating at the ocean surface are complex.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:12-14): 34–39 
*   Below the photic zone is the [mesopelagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopelagic "Mesopelagic") or twilight zone where there is a very small amount of light. The basic concept is that with that little light photosynthesis is unlikely to achieve any net growth over respiration.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:12-14): 116–124 
*   Below that is the aphotic deep ocean to which no surface sunlight at all penetrates. Life that exists deeper than the photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above (see [marine snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_snow "Marine snow")) or find another energy source. [Hydrothermal vents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vents "Hydrothermal vents") are a source of energy in what is known as the [aphotic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphotic_zone "Aphotic zone") (depths exceeding 200 m).[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:4-110)

#### Grouped by depth and temperature

The pelagic part of the aphotic zone can be further divided into vertical regions according to depth and temperature:[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:4-110)

*   The [mesopelagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopelagic "Mesopelagic") is the uppermost region. Its lowermost boundary is at a [thermocline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocline "Thermocline") of 12°C (54°F) which generally lies at 700–1,000 meters (2,300–3,300 ft) in the [tropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics "Tropics"). Next is the [bathypelagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathypelagic "Bathypelagic") lying between 10 and 4°C (50 and 39°F), typically between 700–1,000 meters (2,300–3,300 ft) and 2,000–4,000 meters (6,600–13,100 ft). Lying along the top of the [abyssal plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyssal_plain "Abyssal plain") is the [abyssopelagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyssopelagic "Abyssopelagic"), whose lower boundary lies at about 6,000 meters (20,000 ft). The last and deepest zone is the [hadalpelagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadalpelagic "Hadalpelagic") which includes the [oceanic trench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_trench "Oceanic trench") and lies between 6,000–11,000 meters (20,000–36,000 ft).
*   The [benthic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benthic "Benthic") zones are aphotic and correspond to the three deepest zones of the [deep-sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep-sea "Deep-sea"). The [bathyal zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathyal_zone "Bathyal zone") covers the continental slope down to about 4,000 meters (13,000 ft). The abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000 m. Lastly, the [hadal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadal "Hadal") zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone, which is found in oceanic trenches.

Distinct boundaries between ocean surface waters and deep waters can be drawn based on the properties of the water. These boundaries are called thermoclines (temperature), [haloclines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halocline "Halocline") (salinity), [chemoclines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemocline "Chemocline") (chemistry), and [pycnoclines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pycnocline "Pycnocline") (density). If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a thermocline, a distinct boundary between warmer surface water and colder deep water. In tropical regions, the thermocline is typically deeper compared to higher latitudes. Unlike [polar waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_regions_of_Earth "Polar regions of Earth"), where solar energy input is limited, temperature [stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_stratification "Ocean stratification") is less pronounced, and a distinct thermocline is often absent. This is due to the fact that surface waters in polar latitudes are nearly as cold as deeper waters. Below the thermocline, water everywhere in the ocean is very cold, ranging from −1°C to 3°C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9°C.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-111) If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in salinity with depth, it contains a halocline. If a zone undergoes a strong, vertical chemistry gradient with depth, it contains a chemocline. Temperature and salinity control ocean water density. Colder and saltier water is denser, and this density plays a crucial role in regulating the global water circulation within the ocean.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:4-110) The halocline often coincides with the thermocline, and the combination produces a pronounced pycnocline, a boundary between less dense surface water and dense deep water.

#### Grouped by distance from land

The pelagic zone can be further subdivided into two sub regions based on distance from land: the [neritic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neritic_zone "Neritic zone") and the [oceanic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_zone "Oceanic zone"). The neritic zone covers the water directly above the [continental shelves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_shelves "Continental shelves"), including [coastal waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast "Coast"). On the other hand, the oceanic zone includes all the completely open water.

The [littoral zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littoral_zone "Littoral zone") covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions. It is also known as the [intertidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertidal "Intertidal") zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the region.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:4-110)

### Volumes

The combined volume of water in all the oceans is roughly 1.335 billion cubic kilometers (1.335 [sextillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextillion "Sextillion") liters, 320.3 million cubic miles).[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-NOAA-93)[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-hypertextbook2003-112)[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Charette_Smith_Ocean-depth-113)

It has been estimated that there are 1.386 billion [cubic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_kilometer "Cubic kilometer") kilometres (333 million cubic miles) of water on Earth.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Hydrosphere_USGS-114)[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-115)[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-116) This includes water in gaseous, liquid and frozen forms as soil moisture, [groundwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater "Groundwater") and [permafrost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost "Permafrost") in the [Earth's crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_crust "Earth's crust") (to a depth of 2 km); oceans and [seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_seas "List of seas"), [lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake "Lake"), [rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River "River") and [streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream "Stream"), [wetlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland "Wetland"), [glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier"), ice and snow cover on Earth's surface; vapour, droplets and crystals in the air; and part of living plants, animals and unicellular organisms of the biosphere. [Saltwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water "Saline water") accounts for 97.5% of this amount, whereas [fresh water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water "Fresh water") accounts for only 2.5%. Of this fresh water, 68.9% is in the form of [ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice") and permanent snow cover in the Arctic, the Antarctic and mountain [glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier"); 30.8% is in the form of fresh groundwater; and only 0.3% of the fresh water on Earth is in easily accessible lakes, reservoirs and river systems.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Hydrosphere_Shiklomanov1998-117)

The total mass of Earth's hydrosphere is about 1.4 × 10 18[tonnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonnes "Tonnes"), which is about 0.023% of Earth's total mass. At any given time, about 2 × 10 13 tonnes of this is in the form of [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor "Water vapor") in the [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth") (for practical purposes, 1 cubic metre of water weighs 1 tonne). Approximately 71% of Earth's surface, an area of some 361 million square kilometres (139.5 million square miles), is covered by ocean. The average [salinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity "Salinity") of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams of [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt "Salt") per kilogram of sea water (3.5%).[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-118)

### Temperature

Ocean temperatures depends on the amount of solar radiation falling on its surface. In the tropics, with the Sun nearly overhead, the [temperature of the surface layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature "Sea surface temperature") can rise to over 30°C (86°F) while near the poles the temperature in equilibrium with the [sea ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice "Sea ice") is about −2°C (28°F). There is a continuous circulation of water in the oceans. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics, and the water becomes denser and sinks. The cold water moves back towards the equator as a deep sea current, driven by changes in the temperature and density of the water, before eventually welling up again towards the surface. Deep ocean water has a temperature between −2°C (28°F) and 5°C (41°F) in all parts of the globe.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:7-15)

The temperature gradient over the water depth is related to the way the surface water mixes with deeper water or does not mix (a lack of mixing is called _ocean stratification_). This depends on the temperature: in the tropics the warm surface layer of about 100 m is quite stable and does not mix much with deeper water, while near the poles winter cooling and storms makes the surface layer denser and it mixes to great depth and then stratifies again in summer. The [photic depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_zone "Photic zone") is typically about 100 m (but varies) and is related to this heated surface layer.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:5-119)

It is clear that the ocean is warming as a result of climate change, and this rate of warming is increasing.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_SROCC_SPM_20190925-120): 9  The global ocean was the warmest it had ever been recorded by humans in 2022.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_:110-121) This is determined by the [ocean heat content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_heat_content "Ocean heat content"), which exceeded the previous 2021 maximum in 2022.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_:110-121) The steady rise in ocean temperatures is an unavoidable result of the [Earth's energy imbalance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_Energy_Imbalance "Earth's Energy Imbalance"), which is primarily caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_:110-121) Between pre-industrial times and the 2011–2020 decade, the ocean's surface has heated between 0.68 and 1.01°C.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_AR6_WG1_Chapter9-122): 1214

### Temperature and salinity by region

The temperature and salinity of ocean waters vary significantly across different regions. This is due to differences in the local water balance ([precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation "Precipitation") vs. evaporation) and the "sea to air" [temperature gradients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_gradient "Temperature gradient"). These characteristics can vary widely from one ocean region to another. The table below provides an illustration of the sort of values usually encountered.

General characteristics of ocean surface waters by region[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-ipcc.556-123)[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-ecmwf.era40-124)[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Atmosphere,_Weather,_and_Climate-125)[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-ucar.10-126)[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-127)| Characteristic | [Polar regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_regions "Polar regions") | [Temperate regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_regions "Temperate regions") | [Tropical regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_regions "Tropical regions") |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation "Precipitation") vs. evaporation | Precip > Evap | Precip > Evap | Evap > Precip |
| [Sea surface temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature "Sea surface temperature") in winter | −2°C | 5 to 20°C | 20 to 25°C |
| Average [salinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity "Salinity") | 28‰ to 32‰ | 35‰ | 35‰ to 37‰ |
| Annual variation of [air temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_temperature "Air temperature") | ≤ 40°C | 10°C | < 5°C |
| Annual variation of [water temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_temperature "Sea temperature") | < 5°C | 10°C | < 5°C |

### Sea ice

Seawater with a typical salinity of 35‰ has a freezing point of about −1.8°C (28.8°F).[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:4-110)[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-128) Because sea ice is less [dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense "Dense") than water, it floats on the ocean's surface (as does fresh water ice, which has an even lower density). Sea ice covers about 7% of the Earth's surface and about 12% of the world's oceans.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Wadhams-129)[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Weeks-130)[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Shokr&Sinha-131) Sea ice usually starts to freeze at the very surface, initially as a very thin ice film. As further freezing takes place, this ice film thickens and can form [ice sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet "Ice sheet"). The ice formed incorporates some [sea salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_salt "Sea salt"), but much less than the seawater it forms from. As the ice forms with low salinity this results in saltier residual seawater. This in turn increases density and promotes vertical sinking of the water.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-132)

### Ocean currents and global climate

Ocean surface currents

[![Image 15: World map with colored, directed lines showing how water moves through the oceans. Cold deep water rises and warms in the central Pacific and in the Indian, whereas warm water sinks and cools near Greenland in the North Atlantic and near Antarctica in the South Atlantic.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Thermohaline_Circulation_2.png/330px-Thermohaline_Circulation_2.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thermohaline_Circulation_2.png)

A map of the global [thermohaline circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation "Thermohaline circulation"); blue represents deep-water currents, whereas red represents surface currents.

#### Types of ocean currents

An [ocean current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current "Ocean current") is a continuous, directed flow of seawater caused by several forces acting upon the water. These include wind, the [Coriolis effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect "Coriolis effect"), [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") and [salinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity "Salinity") differences.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:8-16) Ocean currents are primarily horizontal water movements that have different origins such as tides for tidal currents, or wind and waves for surface currents.

Tidal currents are in phase with the [tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide "Tide"), hence are [quasiperiodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasiperiodic "Quasiperiodic"); associated with the influence of the moon and sun pull on the ocean water. Tidal currents may form various complex patterns in certain places, most notably around [headlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_(geography) "Cape (geography)").[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-133) Non-periodic or non-tidal currents are created by the action of winds and changes in [density of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_water "Density of water"). In littoral zones, [breaking waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_wave "Breaking wave") are so intense and the depth measurement so low, that maritime currents reach often 1 to 2 [knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(unit) "Knot (unit)").[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-talley7-134)

The [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind "Wind") and [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave") create surface currents (designated as "drift currents"). These currents can decompose in one quasi-permanent current (which varies within the hourly scale) and one movement of [Stokes drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_drift "Stokes drift") under the effect of rapid waves movement (which vary on timescales of a couple of seconds). The quasi-permanent current is accelerated by the breaking of waves, and in a lesser governing effect, by the friction of the wind on the surface.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-talley7-134)

This acceleration of the current takes place in the direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the ocean depth increases, the [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") of the [earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") changes the direction of currents in proportion with the increase of depth, while friction lowers their speed. At a certain ocean depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with current speed becoming null: known as the [Ekman spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekman_spiral "Ekman spiral"). The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably change and are dependent on the yearly [seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season"). If the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the quasi-permanent current at the surface can adopt quite a different direction in relation to the direction of the wind. In this case, the water column becomes virtually homogeneous above the thermocline.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-talley7-134)

The wind blowing on the ocean surface will set the water in motion. The global pattern of winds (also called [atmospheric circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation "Atmospheric circulation")) creates a global pattern of ocean currents. These are driven not only by the wind but also by the effect of the circulation of the earth ([coriolis force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force "Coriolis force")). These major ocean currents include the [Gulf Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream "Gulf Stream"), [Kuroshio Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuroshio_Current "Kuroshio Current"), [Agulhas Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agulhas_Current "Agulhas Current") and [Antarctic Circumpolar Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current "Antarctic Circumpolar Current"). The Antarctic Circumpolar Current encircles [Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") and influences the area's climate, connecting currents in several oceans.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-talley7-134)

#### Relationship of currents and climate

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/FMIB_36754_Gulf-Stream%2C_coupe_par_l%27Itineraire_des_Paquebots_Transatlantiques_qui_Vont_de_Havre_a_New-York.jpeg/250px-FMIB_36754_Gulf-Stream%2C_coupe_par_l%27Itineraire_des_Paquebots_Transatlantiques_qui_Vont_de_Havre_a_New-York.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FMIB_36754_Gulf-Stream,_coupe_par_l%27Itineraire_des_Paquebots_Transatlantiques_qui_Vont_de_Havre_a_New-York.jpeg)

Map of the [Gulf Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream "Gulf Stream"), a major ocean current that transports heat from the equator to northern latitudes and moderates the climate of [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe")

Collectively, currents move enormous amounts of water and heat around the globe influencing climate. These wind driven currents are largely confined to the top hundreds of meters of the ocean. At greater depth, the [thermohaline circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation "Thermohaline circulation") drives water motion. For example, the [Atlantic meridional overturning circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation "Atlantic meridional overturning circulation") (AMOC) is driven by the cooling of surface waters in the polar latitudes in the north and south, creating dense water which sinks to the bottom of the ocean. This cold and dense water moves slowly away from the [poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_pole "Geographical pole") which is why the waters in the deepest layers of the world ocean are so cold. This deep ocean water circulation is relatively slow and water at the bottom of the ocean can be isolated from the ocean surface and atmosphere for hundreds or even a few thousand years.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-talley7-134) This circulation has important impacts on the global [climate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_system "Climate system") and on the uptake and redistribution of pollutants and gases such as [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"), for example by moving contaminants from the surface into the deep ocean.

[Ocean currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current "Ocean current") greatly affect Earth's climate by [transferring heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferring_heat "Transferring heat") from the [tropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics "Tropics") to the polar regions. This affects air temperature and precipitation in coastal regions and further inland. Surface heat and freshwater [fluxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux "Flux") create global [density gradients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_gradient "Density gradient"), which drive the [thermohaline circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation "Thermohaline circulation") that is a part of large-scale ocean circulation. It plays an important role in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in sea ice regulation.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Oceans moderate the climate of locations where prevailing winds blow in from the ocean. At similar latitudes, a place on Earth with more influence from the ocean will have a more moderate climate than a place with more influence from land. For example, the cities [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco "San Francisco") (37.8 N) and [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") (40.7 N) have different climates because San Francisco has more influence from the ocean. San Francisco, on the west coast of North America, gets [winds from the west](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerlies "Westerlies") over the [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean"). New York, on the east coast of North America gets [winds from the west](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerlies "Westerlies") over land, so New York has colder winters and hotter, earlier summers than San Francisco. Warmer ocean currents yield warmer climates in the long term, even at high latitudes. At similar latitudes, a place influenced by warm ocean currents will have a warmer climate overall than a place influenced by cold ocean currents.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on [Earth's energy budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget "Earth's energy budget"). Because the thermohaline circulation determines the rate at which deep waters reach the surface, it may also significantly influence [atmospheric carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_carbon_dioxide "Atmospheric carbon dioxide") concentrations. Modern observations, [climate simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_model "Climate model") and paleoclimate reconstructions suggest that the [Atlantic meridional overturning circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation "Atlantic meridional overturning circulation") (AMOC) has weakened since the preindustrial era. The latest climate change projections in 2021 suggest that the AMOC is likely to weaken further over the 21st century.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-SROCC_SPM_20190925-135): 19  Such a weakening could cause large changes to global climate, with the North Atlantic particularly vulnerable.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-SROCC_SPM_20190925-135): 19

Chemical properties

### Salinity

[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/WOA09_sea-surf_SAL_AYool.png/500px-WOA09_sea-surf_SAL_AYool.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WOA09_sea-surf_SAL_AYool.png)

Annual mean sea surface salinity in [Practical Salinity Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_Salinity_Unit "Practical Salinity Unit") (psu) from the World Ocean Atlas[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Baranova-136)

[Salinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity "Salinity") is a measure of the total amounts of dissolved salts in [seawater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater "Seawater"). It was originally measured via measurement of the amount of [chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride "Chloride") in seawater and hence termed chlorinity. It is now standard practice to gauge it by measuring [electrical conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity "Electrical conductivity") of the water sample. Salinity can be calculated using the chlorinity, which is a measure of the total mass of [halogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halogen "Halogen") ions (includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) in seawater. According to an international agreement, the following formula is used to determine salinity:[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:6-137)

Salinity (in ‰) = 1.80655 × Chlorinity (in ‰)
The average ocean water chlorinity is about 19.2‰ (equal to 1.92%), and thus the average salinity is around 34.7‰ (3.47%).[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:6-137)

Salinity has a major influence on the density of seawater. A zone of rapid salinity increase with depth is called a [halocline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halocline "Halocline"). As [seawater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity#Seawater "Salinity")'s salt content increases, so does the temperature at which its maximum density occurs. Salinity affects both the freezing and boiling points of water, with the boiling point increasing with salinity. At [atmospheric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure"),[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-138) normal seawater freezes at a temperature of about −2°C.

Salinity is higher in Earth's oceans where there is more [evaporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation "Evaporation") and lower where there is more [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation "Precipitation"). If precipitation exceeds evaporation, as is the case in [polar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_regions_of_Earth "Polar regions of Earth") and some [temperate regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_regions "Temperate regions"), salinity will be lower. Salinity will be higher if evaporation exceeds precipitation, as is sometimes the case in [tropical regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_regions "Tropical regions"). For example, evaporation is greater than precipitation in the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"), which has an average salinity of 38‰, more saline than the global average of 34.7‰.[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Encyclopedia_Britannica-139) Thus, oceanic waters in polar regions have lower salinity content than oceanic waters in tropical regions.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:6-137) However, when [sea ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice "Sea ice") forms at high latitudes, [salt is excluded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinicle "Brinicle") from the ice as it forms, which can increase the salinity in the residual seawater in polar regions such as the [Arctic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean "Arctic Ocean").[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:4-110)[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-National_Snow_and_Ice_Data_Center-140)

Due to the [effects of climate change on oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans#Salinity_changes "Effects of climate change on oceans"), observations of sea surface salinity between 1950 and 2019 indicate that regions of high salinity and evaporation have become more saline while regions of low salinity and more precipitation have become fresher.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-AR6_WG1_Chapter92-141) It is very likely that the Pacific and Antarctic/Southern Oceans have freshened while the Atlantic has become more saline.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-AR6_WG1_Chapter92-141)

### Dissolved gases

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/WOA05_sea-surf_O2_AYool.png/330px-WOA05_sea-surf_O2_AYool.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WOA05_sea-surf_O2_AYool.png)

Sea surface oxygen concentration in moles per cubic meter from the World Ocean Atlas[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-142)

Ocean water contains large quantities of dissolved gases, including [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"), [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide") and [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen"). These dissolve into ocean water via [gas exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_exchange "Gas exchange") at the ocean surface, with the solubility of these gases depending on the temperature and salinity of the water.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:9-17) The four most abundant gases in earth's atmosphere and oceans are nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide. In the ocean by volume, the most abundant gases dissolved in seawater are carbon dioxide (including bicarbonate and carbonate ions, 14 mL/L on average), nitrogen (9 mL/L), and oxygen (5 mL/L) at equilibrium at 24°C (75°F)[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-The_seawater_solution-143)[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-soest.OCN623-144)[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-uiuc.L23-145) All gases are more [soluble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility_of_gases_in_liquids "Solubility of gases in liquids") – more easily dissolved – in colder water than in warmer water. For example, when salinity and pressure are held constant, oxygen concentration in water almost doubles when the temperature drops from that of a warm summer day 30°C (86°F) to freezing 0°C (32°F). Similarly, carbon dioxide and nitrogen gases are more soluble at colder temperatures, and their solubility changes with temperature at different rates.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-The_seawater_solution-143)[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-mit.12.742-146)

### Oxygen, photosynthesis and carbon cycling

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/OceanCarbonCycle.jpg/500px-OceanCarbonCycle.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OceanCarbonCycle.jpg)

Diagram of the ocean carbon cycle showing the relative size of stocks (storage) and fluxes[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-GRID-Arendal_2009-147)

[Photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis "Photosynthesis") in the surface ocean releases oxygen and consumes carbon dioxide. [Phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton "Phytoplankton"), a type of microscopic free-floating algae, controls this process. After the plants have grown, oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide released, as a result of bacterial decomposition of the organic matter created by photosynthesis in the ocean. The sinking and bacterial decomposition of some organic matter in deep ocean water, at depths where the waters are out of contact with the atmosphere, leads to a reduction in oxygen concentrations and increase in carbon dioxide, [carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate "Carbonate") and [bicarbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate "Bicarbonate").[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:5-119) This [cycling of carbon dioxide in oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_carbon_cycle "Oceanic carbon cycle") is an important part of the global [carbon cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle "Carbon cycle").

The oceans represent a major [carbon sink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sink "Carbon sink") for carbon dioxide taken up from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and by dissolution (see also [carbon sequestration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sequestration "Carbon sequestration")). There is also increased attention on carbon dioxide uptake in coastal [marine habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_habitats "Marine habitats") such as [mangroves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove "Mangrove") and [saltmarshes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltmarshes "Saltmarshes"). This process is often referred to as "[Blue carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_carbon "Blue carbon")". The focus is on these ecosystems because they are strong carbon sinks as well as ecologically important habitats under threat from human activities and [environmental degradation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation "Environmental degradation").

As deep ocean water circulates throughout the globe, it contains gradually less oxygen and gradually more carbon dioxide with more time away from the air at the surface. This gradual decrease in oxygen concentration happens as sinking organic matter continuously gets decomposed during the time the water is out of contact with the atmosphere.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:5-119) Most of the deep waters of the ocean still contain relatively high concentrations of oxygen sufficient for most animals to survive. However, some ocean areas have very low oxygen due to long periods of isolation of the water from the atmosphere. These oxygen deficient areas, called [oxygen minimum zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_minimum_zone "Oxygen minimum zone") or [hypoxic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental) "Hypoxia (environmental)") waters, will generally be made worse by the [effects of climate change on oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans "Effects of climate change on oceans").[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:2-148)[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Karstensen2008-149)

### pH

The [pH value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_value "PH value") at the surface of oceans (_global mean surface pH_) is currently approximately in the range of 8.05[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-150) to 8.08.[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:82-151) This makes it slightly [alkaline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity "Alkalinity"). The pH value at the surface used to be about 8.2 during the past 300 million years.[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-NatGeo-152) However, between 1950 and 2020, the average pH of the ocean surface fell from approximately 8.15 to 8.05.[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-153)[Carbon dioxide emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_emissions "Carbon dioxide emissions") from human activities are the primary cause of this process called _ocean acidification_, with [atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere "Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere") exceeding 410 ppm (in 2020).[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:14-154) CO 2 from the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") is absorbed by the oceans. This produces [carbonic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_acid "Carbonic acid") (H 2 CO 3) which dissociates into a [bicarbonate ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate_ion "Bicarbonate ion") (HCO−3) and a [hydrogen ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_ion "Hydrogen ion") (H+). The presence of free hydrogen ions (H+) lowers the pH of the ocean.

There is a natural gradient of pH in the ocean which is related to the breakdown of organic matter in deep water which slowly lowers the pH with depth: The pH value of seawater is naturally as low as 7.8 in deep ocean waters as a result of degradation of organic matter there.[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:11-155) It can be as high as 8.4 in surface waters in areas of high [biological productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_productivity "Biological productivity").[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:5-119)

The definition of _global mean surface pH_ refers to the top layer of the water in the ocean, up to around 20 or 100 m depth. In comparison, the average depth of the ocean is about 4 km. The pH value at greater depths (more than 100 m) has not yet been affected by ocean acidification in the same way. There is a large body of deeper water where the natural gradient of pH from 8.2 to about 7.8 still exists and it will take a very long time to acidify these waters, and equally as long to recover from that acidification. But as the top layer of the ocean (the [photic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_zone "Photic zone")) is crucial for its marine productivity, any changes to the pH value and temperature of the top layer can have many knock-on effects, for example on [marine life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life "Marine life") and [ocean currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current "Ocean current") (such as effects of climate change on oceans).[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:5-119)

The key issue in terms of the penetration of ocean acidification is the way the surface water mixes with deeper water or does not mix (a lack of mixing is called [ocean stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_stratification "Ocean stratification")). This in turn depends on the water temperature and hence is different between the tropics and the polar regions (see [ocean#Temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#Temperature)).[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:5-119)

The [chemical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_properties "Chemical properties") of seawater complicate pH measurement, and several distinct pH scales exist in [chemical oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_oceanography "Chemical oceanography").[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-zeebe-156) There is no universally accepted reference pH-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on multiple reference scales may be up to 0.14 units.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:02-157)

### Alkalinity

[Alkalinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity "Alkalinity") is the balance of base (proton acceptors) and acids (proton donors) in seawater, or indeed any natural waters. The alkalinity acts as a [chemical buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_buffer "Chemical buffer"), regulating the pH of seawater. While there are many ions in seawater that can contribute to the alkalinity, many of these are at very low concentrations. This means that the carbonate, bicarbonate and borate ions are the only significant contributors to seawater alkalinity in the open ocean with well oxygenated waters. The first two of these ions contribute more than 95% of this alkalinity.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:5-119)

The chemical equation for alkalinity in seawater is:

A T = [HCO 3−] + 2[CO 3 2-] + [B(OH)4−]
The growth of phytoplankton in surface ocean waters leads to the conversion of some bicarbonate and carbonate ions into organic matter. Some of this organic matter sinks into the deep ocean where it is broken down back into carbonate and bicarbonate. This process is related to ocean productivity or [marine primary production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_primary_production "Marine primary production"). Thus alkalinity tends to increase with depth and also along the global thermohaline circulation from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Indian Ocean, although these increases are small. The concentrations vary overall by only a few percent.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:5-119)[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:11-155)

The absorption of CO 2 from the atmosphere does not affect the ocean's alkalinity.[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-IPCC_AR6_WGI_Glossary-158): 2252  It does lead to a reduction in pH value though (termed [ocean acidification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification "Ocean acidification")).[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:14-154)

### Residence times of chemical elements and ions

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Sydney_%28AU%29%2C_Coast%2C_New_Zealand_sea_lions_--_2019_--_3489.jpg/250px-Sydney_%28AU%29%2C_Coast%2C_New_Zealand_sea_lions_--_2019_--_3489.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sydney_(AU),_Coast,_New_Zealand_sea_lions_--_2019_--_3489.jpg)

Residence time of elements in the ocean depends on supply by processes like [rock weathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weathering "Weathering") and [rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River "River") vs. removal by processes like [evaporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation "Evaporation") and [sedimentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation "Sedimentation").

The ocean waters contain many [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element") as dissolved ions. Elements dissolved in ocean waters have a wide range of concentrations. Some elements have very high concentrations of several grams per liter, such as [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium "Sodium") and chloride, together making up the majority of ocean salts. Other elements, such as iron, are present at tiny concentrations of just a few nanograms (10−9 grams) per liter.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:6-137)

The concentration of any element depends on its rate of supply to the ocean and its rate of removal. Elements enter the ocean from rivers, the atmosphere and [hydrothermal vents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent "Hydrothermal vent"). Elements are removed from ocean water by sinking and becoming buried in [sediments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment "Sediment") or evaporating to the atmosphere in the case of water and some gases. By estimating the [residence time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residence_time "Residence time") of an element, oceanographers examine the balance of input and removal. Residence time is the average time the element would spend dissolved in the ocean before it is removed. Heavily abundant elements in ocean water such as sodium, have high input rates. This reflects high abundance in rocks and rapid rock weathering, paired with very slow removal from the ocean due to sodium ions being comparatively unreactive and highly soluble. In contrast, other elements such as iron and [aluminium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium "Aluminium") are abundant in rocks but very insoluble, meaning that inputs to the ocean are low and removal is rapid. These cycles represent part of the major global cycle of elements that has gone on since the Earth first formed. The residence times of the very abundant elements in the ocean are estimated to be millions of years, while for highly reactive and insoluble elements, residence times are only hundreds of years.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:6-137)

Residence times of elements and ions[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-uga.3030-159)[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-chapter_11-160)| Chemical element or ion | Residence time (years) |

A few elements such as nitrogen, [phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus "Phosphorus"), [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron"), and [potassium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium "Potassium") essential for life, are major components of biological material, and are commonly known as "[nutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient")". Nitrate and phosphate have ocean residence times of 10,000[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-161) and 69,000[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-162) years, respectively, while potassium is a much more abundant ion in the ocean with a residence time of 12 million[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-163) years. The biological cycling of these elements means that this represents a continuous removal process from the ocean's water column as degrading organic material sinks to the ocean floor as sediment.

Phosphate from [intensive agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_agriculture "Intensive agriculture") and [untreated sewage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment "Sewage treatment") is transported via runoff to rivers and coastal zones to the ocean where it is metabolized. Eventually, it sinks to the ocean floor and is no longer available to humans as a commercial resource.[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-164) Production of [rock phosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_phosphate "Rock phosphate"), an essential ingredient in inorganic [fertilizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer "Fertilizer"),[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-165) is a slow geological process that occurs in some of the world's ocean sediments, rendering mineable sedimentary [apatite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite "Apatite") (phosphate) a [non-renewable resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-renewable_resource "Non-renewable resource") (see [peak phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_phosphorus "Peak phosphorus")). This continual net deposition loss of non-renewable phosphate from human activities, may become a resource issue for fertilizer production and [food security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security "Food security") in future.[[166]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-166)[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-AmundsonBerhe2015-167)

Marine life

 Some representative ocean animals (not drawn to scale) within their approximate depth-defined ecological habitats. [Marine microorganisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_microorganisms "Marine microorganisms") also exist on the surfaces and within the tissues and organs of the diverse life inhabiting the ocean, across all ocean habitats. The animals rooted to or living on the ocean floor are not [pelagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic "Pelagic") but are [benthic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benthic "Benthic") animals.[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Apprill2017-168)

Life within the ocean [evolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolved "Evolved") 3 billion years prior to life on land. Both the depth and the distance from shore strongly influence the [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity") of the plants and animals present in each region.[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-bcc.34-169) The diversity of life in the ocean is immense, including:

*   [Animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals "Animals"): most animal [phyla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum "Phylum") have species that inhabit the ocean, including many that are found only in marine environments such as [sponges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponges "Sponges"), [Cnidaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria "Cnidaria") (such as [corals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral "Coral") and [jellyfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish "Jellyfish")), [comb jellies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb_jellies "Comb jellies"), [Brachiopods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiopod "Brachiopod"), and [Echinoderms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinoderm "Echinoderm") (such as [sea urchins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin "Sea urchin") and [sea stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_star "Sea star")). Many other familiar animal groups primarily live in the ocean, including [cephalopods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod "Cephalopod") (includes [octopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus "Octopus") and [squid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid "Squid")), [crustaceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean "Crustacean") (includes [lobsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster "Lobster"), [crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab "Crab"), and [shrimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp "Shrimp")), [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish "Fish"), [sharks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharks "Sharks"), [cetaceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean "Cetacean") (includes [whales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale "Whale"), [dolphins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin "Dolphin"), and [porpoises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoise "Porpoise")). In addition, many land animals have adapted to living a major part of their life on the oceans. For instance, [seabirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabirds "Seabirds") are a diverse group of birds that have adapted to a life mainly on the oceans. They feed on marine animals and spend most of their lifetime on water, many going on land only for breeding. Other birds that have adapted to oceans as their living space are [penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin "Penguin"), [seagulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagulls "Seagulls") and [pelicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelecaniformes "Pelecaniformes"). Seven species of turtles, the [sea turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_turtle "Sea turtle"), also spend most of their time in the oceans.
*   [Plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants "Plants"): including [sea grasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagrass "Seagrass"), or [mangroves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangroves "Mangroves")

[Killer whales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale "Killer whale") (orcas) are highly visible marine [apex predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_predator "Apex predator") that hunt many large species. But most biological activity in the ocean takes place with [microscopic marine organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_microorganism "Marine microorganism") that cannot be seen individually with the naked eye, such as [marine bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_bacteria "Marine bacteria") and [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_phytoplankton "Marine phytoplankton").[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Marine_life_Cavicchioli_2019-170)

[Marine life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life "Marine life"), sea life or ocean life is the collective [ecological communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_communities "Ecological communities") that encompass all [aquatic animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_animal "Aquatic animal"), [plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_plant "Aquatic plant"), [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae "Algae"), [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_fungi "Marine fungi"), [protists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_protists "Marine protists"), [single-celled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-celled "Single-celled")[microorganisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_microorganisms "Marine microorganisms") and associated [viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_virus "Marine virus") living in the [saline water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water "Saline water") of [marine habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_habitat "Marine habitat"), either the [sea water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_water "Sea water") of [marginal seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_sea "Marginal sea") and oceans, or the [brackish water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brackish_water "Brackish water") of [coastal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast "Coast")[wetlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland "Wetland"), [lagoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon "Lagoon"), [estuaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary "Estuary") and [inland seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_sea "Inland sea"). As of 2023, more than 242,000 marine [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species") have been documented, and perhaps two million marine species are yet to be documented. An average of 2,332 new species per year are being described.[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Marine_life_Drogin_2009-171)[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-172) Marine life is studied scientifically in both [marine biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology "Marine biology") and in [biological oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_oceanography "Biological oceanography").

Today, marine species range in size from the microscopic [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton "Phytoplankton"), which can be as small as 0.02–[micrometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre "Micrometre"); to huge [cetaceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean "Cetacean") like the [blue whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale "Blue whale"), which can reach 33 m (108 ft) in length.[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-173)[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-174) Marine microorganisms have been variously estimated as constituting about 70%[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Marine_life_Bar-On_2018-175) or about 90%[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-176)[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Marine_life_Cavicchioli_2019-170) of the total marine [biomass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology) "Biomass (ecology)").

Coral reefs form complex marine ecosystems with tremendous [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity").

[Marine ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_ecosystem "Marine ecosystem") are the largest of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")'s [aquatic ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ecosystem "Aquatic ecosystem") and exist in [waters that have a high salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water "Saline water") content. These systems contrast with [freshwater ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater_ecosystem "Freshwater ecosystem"), which have a lower [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt "Salt") content. Marine waters cover more than 70% of the surface of the Earth and account for more than 97% of Earth's water supply[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-178)[[179]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-179) and 90% of habitable space on Earth.[[180]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-180) Seawater has an average salinity of 35 [parts per thousand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation "Parts-per notation") of water. Actual salinity varies among different marine ecosystems.[[181]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Marine_ecosystem_USEPA-181) Marine ecosystems can be divided into many zones depending upon water depth and shoreline features. The oceanic zone is the vast open part of the ocean where animals such as whales, sharks, and tuna live. The [benthic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benthic "Benthic") zone consists of substrates below water where many invertebrates live. The [intertidal zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertidal_zone "Intertidal zone") is the area between high and low tides.

These activities serve a wide variety of purposes, including [navigation and exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_navigation "History of navigation"), [naval warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_warfare "Naval warfare"), travel, [shipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping "Shipping") and [trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade "Trade"), food production (e.g. [fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing "Fishing"), [whaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling "Whaling"), [seaweed farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed_farming "Seaweed farming"), [aquaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture "Aquaculture")), leisure ([cruising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruising_(maritime) "Cruising (maritime)"), [sailing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing "Sailing"), [recreational boat fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_boat_fishing "Recreational boat fishing"), [scuba diving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving "Scuba diving")), power generation (see [marine energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_energy "Marine energy") and [offshore wind power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power "Offshore wind power")), extractive industries ([offshore drilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_drilling "Offshore drilling") and [deep sea mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_mining "Deep sea mining")), [freshwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater "Freshwater") production via [desalination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desalination "Desalination").

Many of the world's goods are moved by [ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship "Ship") between the world's [seaports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaport "Seaport").[[182]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-182) Large quantities of goods are transported across the ocean, especially across the Atlantic and around the Pacific Rim.[[183]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-183) Many types of cargo including manufactured goods, are typically transported in [standard sized, lockable containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_container "Shipping container") that are loaded on purpose-built [container ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship "Container ship") at [dedicated terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_port "Container port").[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Sauerbier-184) Containerization greatly boosted the efficiency and reduced the cost of shipping products by sea. This was a major factor in the rise of [globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization "Globalization") and exponential increases in [international trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade "International trade") in the mid-to-late 20th century.[[185]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-185)

Oceans are also the major supply source for the [fishing industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_industry "Fishing industry"). Some of the major harvests are [shrimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp "Shrimp"), [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish "Fish"), [crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crabs "Crabs"), and [lobster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster "Lobster").[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-noaa.gov-89) The biggest global commercial fishery is for [anchovies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchovies "Anchovies"), [Alaska pollock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_pollock "Alaska pollock") and [tuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuna "Tuna").[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:1-186): 6  A report by [FAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAO "FAO") in 2020 stated that "in 2017, 34 percent of the fish stocks of the world's marine fisheries were classified as [overfished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfished "Overfished")".[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:1-186): 54  Fish and other fishery products from both [wild fisheries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_fisheries "Wild fisheries") and aquaculture are among the most widely consumed sources of protein and other essential nutrients. Data in 2017 showed that "fish consumption accounted for 17 percent of the global population's intake of animal proteins".[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-:1-186) To fulfill this need, coastal countries have exploited marine resources in their [exclusive economic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone "Exclusive economic zone"). Fishing vessels are increasingly venturing out to exploit stocks in international waters.[[187]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-GreenFacts-187)

The ocean has a vast amount of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") carried by [ocean waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_wave "Ocean wave"), [tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide "Tide"), [salinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity "Salinity") differences, and ocean temperature differences which can be harnessed to [generate electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation "Electricity generation").[[188]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-OES-188) Forms of [sustainable marine energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy "Sustainable energy") include [tidal power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_power "Tidal power"), [ocean thermal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_thermal_energy "Ocean thermal energy") and [wave power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_power "Wave power").[[188]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-OES-188)[[189]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-189) Offshore wind power is captured by [wind turbines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine "Wind turbine") placed out on the ocean; it has the advantage that wind speeds are higher than on land, though wind farms are more costly to construct offshore.[[190]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-190) There are large deposits of [petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum "Petroleum"), as oil and [natural gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas "Natural gas"), in rocks beneath the ocean floor. [Offshore platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_platform "Oil platform") and [drilling rigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drilling_rig "Drilling rig") extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land.[[191]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-191)

"Freedom of the seas" is a principle in [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law "International law") dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in [international waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters "International waters"). Today, this concept is enshrined in the [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea "United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea") (UNCLOS).[[192]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-history-192)

The [International Maritime Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Maritime_Organization "International Maritime Organization") (IMO), which was ratified in 1958, is mainly responsible for [maritime safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_safety "Maritime safety"), liability and compensation, and has held some conventions on marine pollution related to shipping incidents. [Ocean governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_governance "Ocean governance") is the conduct of the policy, actions and affairs regarding the world's [oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceans "Oceans").[[193]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-193)

Threats from human activities
-----------------------------

[![Image 26](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Global_cumulative_human_impact_on_the_ocean.png/500px-Global_cumulative_human_impact_on_the_ocean.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Global_cumulative_human_impact_on_the_ocean.png)

Global cumulative human impact on the ocean[[194]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Halpern2019-194)

Human activities affect marine life and [marine habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_habitat "Marine habitat") through many negative influences, such as marine pollution (including marine debris and microplastics) [overfishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfishing "Overfishing"), ocean acidification and other effects of climate change on oceans.

### Climate change

There are many [effects of climate change on oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans "Effects of climate change on oceans"). One of the most important is an increase in [ocean temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_temperature "Ocean temperature"). More frequent [marine heatwaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_heatwave "Marine heatwave") are linked to this. The rising temperature contributes to a [rise in sea levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise "Sea level rise") due to the expansion of water as it warms and the melting of [ice sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet "Ice sheet") on land. Other effects on oceans include [sea ice decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_sea_ice_decline "Arctic sea ice decline"), reducing [pH values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification "Ocean acidification") and [oxygen levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_deoxygenation "Ocean deoxygenation"), as well as increased [ocean stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_stratification "Ocean stratification"). All this can lead to changes of [ocean currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_currents "Ocean currents"), for example a weakening of the [Atlantic meridional overturning circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation "Atlantic meridional overturning circulation") (AMOC).[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_SROCC_SPM_20190925-120) The main cause of these changes are the [emissions of greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_of_greenhouse_gases "Emissions of greenhouse gases") from human activities, mainly burning of [fossil fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel "Fossil fuel") and [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation "Deforestation"). [Carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide") and [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane") are examples of greenhouse gases. The additional [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect "Greenhouse effect") leads to [ocean warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_heat_content "Ocean heat content") because the ocean takes up most of the additional heat in the [climate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_system "Climate system").[[195]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-195) The ocean also absorbs some of the extra [carbon dioxide that is in the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_the_atmosphere "Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere"). This causes the [pH value of the seawater to drop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification "Ocean acidification").[[196]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_:12-196) Scientists estimate that the ocean absorbs about 25% of all human-caused CO 2 emissions.[[196]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_:12-196)

The various layers of the oceans have different temperatures. For example, the water is colder towards the bottom of the ocean. This temperature stratification will increase as the ocean surface warms due to rising air temperatures.[[197]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_:10-197): 471  Connected to this is a decline in mixing of the ocean layers, so that warm water stabilises near the surface. A reduction of cold, deep [water circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_circulation "Water circulation") follows. The reduced vertical mixing makes it harder for the ocean to absorb heat. So a larger share of future warming goes into the atmosphere and land. One result is an increase in the amount of energy available for [tropical cyclones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone") and other storms. Another result is a decrease in [nutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient") for fish in the upper ocean layers. These changes also reduce the ocean's capacity to [store carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sink "Carbon sink").[[198]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-198) At the same time, contrasts in [salinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity "Salinity") are increasing. Salty areas are becoming saltier and fresher areas less salty.[[199]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_ChengSalinity-199)

Warmer water cannot contain the same amount of oxygen as cold water. As a result, oxygen from the oceans moves to the atmosphere. Increased [thermal stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_stratification "Ocean stratification") may reduce the supply of oxygen from surface waters to deeper waters. This lowers the water's oxygen content even more.[[200]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-200) The ocean has already lost oxygen throughout its [water column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_column "Water column"). [Oxygen minimum zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_minimum_zone "Oxygen minimum zone") are increasing in size worldwide.[[197]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_:10-197): 471

These changes harm [marine ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_ecosystem "Marine ecosystem"), and this can lead to [biodiversity loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss "Biodiversity loss") or changes in species distribution.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_SROCC_SPM_20190925-120) This in turn can [affect fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_and_fisheries "Climate change and fisheries") and coastal tourism. For example, rising water temperatures are harming tropical [coral reefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef "Coral reef"). The direct effect is [coral bleaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching "Coral bleaching") on these reefs, because they are sensitive to even minor temperature changes. So a small increase in water temperature could have a significant impact in these environments. Another example is loss of [sea ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice "Sea ice") habitats due to warming. This will have severe impacts on [polar bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear "Polar bear") and other animals that rely on it. The effects of climate change on oceans put additional pressures on ocean ecosystems which are already under pressure by other [impacts from human activities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_marine_life "Human impact on marine life").[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Effects_of_climate_change_on_oceans_SROCC_SPM_20190925-120)

### Marine pollution

[Marine pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_pollution "Marine pollution") occurs when substances used or spread by humans, such as [industrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_waste "Industrial waste"), [agricultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_pollution "Agricultural pollution"), and [residential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste "Municipal solid waste")[waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste "Waste"); [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_(ecology) "Particle (ecology)"); [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise "Noise"); excess [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"); or [invasive organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_organism "Invasive organism") enter the ocean and cause harmful effects there. The majority of this waste (80%) comes from land-based activity, although [marine transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Transportation "Marine Transportation") significantly contributes as well.[[201]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Marine_pollution_:03-201) It is a combination of chemicals and trash, most of which comes from land sources and is washed or blown into the ocean. This pollution results in damage to the [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment "Natural environment"), to the health of all organisms, and to economic structures worldwide.[[202]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-202) Since most inputs come from land, via [rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River "River"), [sewage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage "Sewage"), or the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere"), it means that [continental shelves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_shelf "Continental shelf") are more vulnerable to pollution. [Air pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution "Air pollution") is also a contributing factor, as it carries iron, carbonic acid, [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen"), silicon, sulfur, [pesticides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticides "Pesticides"), and dust particles into the ocean.[[203]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-203) The pollution often comes from [nonpoint sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpoint_source_pollution "Nonpoint source pollution") such as agricultural [runoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff "Surface runoff"), wind-blown [debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debris "Debris"), and dust. These nonpoint sources are largely due to runoff that enters the ocean through rivers, but wind-blown debris and dust can also play a role, as these pollutants can settle into waterways and oceans.[[204]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-204) Pathways of pollution include direct discharge, land runoff, [ship pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_effects_of_shipping "Environmental effects of shipping"), [bilge pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilge_pollution "Bilge pollution"), [dredging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredging "Dredging") (which can create [dredge plumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredge_plume "Dredge plume")), atmospheric pollution and, potentially, [deep sea mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_mining "Deep sea mining").

The types of marine pollution can be grouped as pollution from [marine debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_debris "Marine debris"), [plastic pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_soup "Plastic soup"), including [microplastics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics "Microplastics"), [ocean acidification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification "Ocean acidification"), [nutrient pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient_pollution "Nutrient pollution"), toxins, and underwater noise. Plastic pollution in the ocean is a type of marine pollution by [plastics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution "Plastic pollution"), ranging in size from large original material such as bottles and bags, down to [microplastics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics "Microplastics") formed from the fragmentation of plastic materials. Marine debris is mainly discarded human rubbish which floats on, or is suspended in the ocean. Plastic pollution is harmful to [marine life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life "Marine life").

Another concern is the runoff of [nutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient") (nitrogen and phosphorus) from [intensive agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_farming "Intensive farming"), and the disposal of untreated or partially treated [sewage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage "Sewage") to rivers and subsequently oceans. These [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") and [phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus "Phosphorus") nutrients (which are also contained in [fertilizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer "Fertilizer")) stimulate [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton "Phytoplankton") and [macroalgal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroalgal "Macroalgal") growth, which can lead to harmful [algal blooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algal_bloom "Algal bloom") ([eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication "Eutrophication")) which can be harmful to humans as well as marine creatures. Excessive algal growth can also smother sensitive [coral reefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef "Coral reef") and lead to [loss of biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss "Biodiversity loss") and coral health. A second major concern is that the degradation of [algal blooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algal_bloom "Algal bloom") can lead to consumption of [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") in coastal waters, a situation that may worsen with [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") as warming reduces vertical mixing of the water column.[[205]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Marine_pollution_:2-205)

Many potentially toxic chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by [plankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton "Plankton") and [benthic animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benthos "Benthos"), most of which are either [deposit feeders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_feeder "Deposit feeder") or [filter feeders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_feeder "Filter feeder"). In this way, the toxins are [concentrated upward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomagnification "Biomagnification") within ocean [food chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain "Food chain"). When pesticides are incorporated into the [marine ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_ecosystem "Marine ecosystem"), they quickly become absorbed into marine [food webs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_web "Food web"). Once in the food webs, these pesticides can cause [mutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation "Mutation"), as well as diseases, which can be harmful to humans as well as the entire food web. [Toxic metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_metal "Toxic metal") can also be introduced into marine food webs. These can cause a change to tissue matter, biochemistry, behavior, reproduction, and suppress growth in marine life. Also, many [animal feeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_feed "Compound feed") have a high [fish meal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_meal "Fish meal") or [fish hydrolysate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_hydrolysate "Fish hydrolysate") content. In this way, [marine toxins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin "Toxin") can be transferred to land animals, and appear later in meat and dairy products.

### Overfishing

[Overfishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfishing "Overfishing") is the removal of a species of [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish "Fish") (i.e. [fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing "Fishing")) from a [body of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_water "Body of water") at a rate greater than that the species can replenish its [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population "Population") naturally (i.e. the [overexploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overexploitation "Overexploitation") of the [fishery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishery "Fishery")'s existing [fish stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_stocks "Fish stocks")), resulting in the species becoming increasingly [underpopulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underpopulated "Underpopulated") in that area. Overfishing can occur in water bodies of any sizes, such as [ponds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pond "Pond"), [wetlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland "Wetland"), [rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River "River"), [lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake "Lake") or oceans, and can result in [resource depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_depletion "Resource depletion"), reduced biological growth rates and low [biomass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology) "Biomass (ecology)") levels. Sustained overfishing can lead to [critical depensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_depensation "Critical depensation"), where the fish population is no longer able to sustain itself. Some forms of overfishing, such as the [overfishing of sharks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_sharks "Threatened sharks"), has led to the upset of entire [marine ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_ecosystem "Marine ecosystem").[[206]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-206) Types of overfishing include growth overfishing, recruitment overfishing, and ecosystem overfishing. Overfishing not only causes negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but also reduces fish production, which subsequently leads to negative social and economic consequences.[[207]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-Overfishing_:122-207)

Protection
----------

Ocean protection serves to safeguard the ecosystems in the oceans upon which humans depend.[[208]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-208)[[209]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-209) Protecting these ecosystems from threats is a major component of [environmental protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_protection "Environmental protection"). One of protective measures is the creation and enforcement of [marine protected areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_protected_area "Marine protected area") (MPAs). Marine protection may need to be considered within a national, regional and international context.[[210]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-210) Other measures include supply chain transparency requirement policies, policies to prevent marine pollution, ecosystem-assistance (e.g. [for coral reefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching#Artificial_assistance "Coral bleaching")) and support for [sustainable seafood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_seafood "Sustainable seafood") (e.g. [sustainable fishing practices and types of aquaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_fishery#Remediation "Sustainable fishery")). There is also the protection of marine resources and components whose extraction or disturbance would cause substantial harm, engagement of broader publics and impacted communities,[[211]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-211) and the development of ocean clean-up projects ([removal of marine plastic pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_plastic_pollution#Reduction_efforts "Marine plastic pollution")). Examples of the latter include [Clean Oceans International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Oceans_International "Clean Oceans International") and [The Ocean Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ocean_Cleanup "The Ocean Cleanup").

In 2021, 43 expert scientists published the first scientific framework version that – via integration, [review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_review "Scientific review"), clarifications and [standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization "Standardization") – enables the evaluation of levels of protection of marine protected areas and can serve as a guide for any subsequent efforts to improve, plan and monitor marine protection quality and extents. Examples are the efforts towards the 30%-protection-goal of the "Global Deal For Nature"[[212]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-212) and the UN's [Sustainable Development Goal 14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_14 "Sustainable Development Goal 14") ("life below water").[[213]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-213)[[214]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-214)

In March 2023 a [High Seas Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Seas_Treaty "High Seas Treaty") was signed. It is legally binding. The main achievement is the new possibility to create marine protected areas in international waters. By doing so the agreement now makes it possible to protect 30% of the oceans by 2030 (part of the [30 by 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_by_30 "30 by 30") target).[[215]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-NPR-215)[[216]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-greenpeace-216) The treaty has articles regarding the principle "polluter-pays", and different impacts of human activities including areas beyond the national jurisdiction of the countries making those activities. The agreement was adopted by the 193 United Nations Member States.[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean#cite_note-217)
