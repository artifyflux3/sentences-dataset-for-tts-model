An organized grouping of thunder clouds will thus be considered as a series of storm cells with their up/downdrafts being independent or interfering one with the other.

[ 1 ] Characteristics [ edit ] A storm cell can extend over an area the size of a few tens of square miles/kilometers and last 30 minutes or so.

[ 2 ] When the updraft and the environmental wind shear is well coordinated, the size and the duration of the cell can be much greater leading to a supercell .

[ 2 ] Finally, storm cells can form on the outflow of previous cells leading to multicellular thunderstorms or mesoscale convective systems . Slow motion of these more intense storm cells or groups of cells can produce large precipitation accumulations and flash flood, or other dangerous phenomena like hail and tornadoes .

[ 3 ] Life cycle [ edit ] Life cycle of a single thunderstorm cell One can distinguish three stages in the evolution of a thunderstorm cell: [ 2 ] [ 3 ] formation: the upward current of the cell intensifies and allows the condensation of water vapor from the rising air parcel. This forms a cumulus congestus , then a cumulonimbus when ice crystals form at its apex which spreads horizontally in contact with the tropopause.

maturity: downdrafts are emerging. This stage is accompanied by characteristic phenomena such as lightning and thunder , showers (sometimes hail ) and gust front .

dissipation: the cold pool descending from the cloud extends to the earth's surface and helps to block the feed by pushing the updraft downstream.
