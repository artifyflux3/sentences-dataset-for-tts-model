The purple and green nodes are [semiprime ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiprime_ideal "Semiprime ideal"), and the purple and blue nodes are [primary ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_ideal "Primary ideal").

In [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra"), a **prime ideal** is a [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of a [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)") that shares many important properties of a [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number") in the ring of [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer#Algebraic_properties "Integer").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-2) The prime ideals for the integers are the sets that contain all the [multiples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_(mathematics) "Multiple (mathematics)") of a given prime number, together with the [zero ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_ideal "Zero ideal").

[Primitive ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_ideal "Primitive ideal") are prime, and prime ideals are both [primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_ideal "Primary ideal") and [semiprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiprime_ideal "Semiprime ideal").

Prime ideals for commutative rings
----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prime_ideal&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Prime ideals for commutative rings")]

An [ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory) "Ideal (ring theory)")P of a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring")R is **prime** if it has the following two properties:

*   If a and b are two elements of R such that their product _ab_ is an element of P, then _a_ is in P or _b_ is in P,
*   P is not the whole ring R.

This generalizes the following property of prime numbers, known as [Euclid's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_lemma "Euclid's lemma"): if _p_ is a prime number and if _p_[divides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divides "Divides") a product _ab_ of two [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer"), then _p_ divides _a_ or _p_ divides _b_. We can therefore say

A positive integer n is a prime number [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if")![Image 3: {\displaystyle n\mathbb {Z} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33e5e8bd9b24ba5d0b31eda653b78a63e1af831d) is a prime ideal in ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/89f4f38f32c2068bca9dc701d13b03dd4a5d52ab)
The set of prime ideals of a commutative ring _R_ is known as its **(prime)**[**spectrum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(ring_theory) "Spectrum (ring theory)") and is denoted ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathrm {Spec} \ R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f3f564d84ba40a6a948dedfb9d147aa54ae3b213). Depending on context, this terminology and notation are also used to refer to the set of prime ideals equipped with additional structures, a topology and a sheaf of rings, that make it a geometric object known as an affine [scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)").

*   A simple example: In the ring ![Image 6: {\displaystyle R=\mathbb {Z} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3541bd0918122c77afb3db532c2dfd89625f4cd1) the subset of [even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics) "Parity (mathematics)") numbers is a prime ideal.
*   Given an [integral domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_domain "Integral domain")![Image 7: {\displaystyle R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33), any [prime element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_element "Prime element")![Image 8: {\displaystyle p\in R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e73a42d31678c7dc3425fa61c35d89a6ea0ec99) generates a [principal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_ideal_domain "Principal ideal domain") prime ideal ![Image 9: {\displaystyle (p)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a42b43fe924fbe82623de1aa506862fc522c5c0c). For example, take an irreducible polynomial ![Image 10: {\displaystyle f(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/61d6311d8c66acc1a5755c4c7cb688d3b1fa0fcb) in a polynomial ring ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} [x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/096a47b8d74b985081288a6194e5035494194845) over some [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/573f72afae7df709959ab1a58cd643743466a187). [Eisenstein's criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenstein%27s_criterion "Eisenstein's criterion") for integral domains (hence [UFDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_factorization_domain "Unique factorization domain")) can be effective for determining if an element in a [polynomial ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring "Polynomial ring") is [irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_polynomial "Irreducible polynomial").
*   If R denotes the ring ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [X,Y]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f308fbebb8ac58938655706d0b75e7a167e25a23) of [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") in two variables with [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number")[coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient "Coefficient"), then the ideal generated by the polynomial _Y_ 2 − _X_ 3 − _X_ − 1 is a prime ideal (see [elliptic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve "Elliptic curve")).
*   In the ring ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [X]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5a538d203a057d4c604f799c28e9a7be410fdcac) of all polynomials with integer coefficients, the ideal generated by 2 and X is a prime ideal. The ideal consists of all polynomials constructed by taking 2 times an element of ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [X]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5a538d203a057d4c604f799c28e9a7be410fdcac) and adding it to X times another polynomial in ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [X]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5a538d203a057d4c604f799c28e9a7be410fdcac) (which converts the constant coefficient in the latter polynomial into a linear coefficient). Therefore, the resultant ideal consists of all those polynomials whose constant coefficient is even.
*   In any ring R, a **[maximal ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_ideal "Maximal ideal")** is an ideal M that is [maximal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_element "Maximal element") in the set of all [proper ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_ideal "Proper ideal") of R, i.e. M is [contained in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") exactly two ideals of R, namely M itself and the whole ring R. Every maximal ideal is in fact prime. In a [principal ideal domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_ideal_domain "Principal ideal domain") every nonzero prime ideal is maximal, but this is not true in general. For the UFD ![Image 17: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d85aa77dcb275059c2ef9fb836c34c82d14823de),[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_Nullstellensatz "Hilbert's Nullstellensatz") states that every maximal ideal is of the form ![Image 18: {\displaystyle (x_{1}-\alpha _{1},\ldots ,x_{n}-\alpha _{n}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/270cb995a50c868f24d5bfb27f7df69830683d6d)
*   If M is a [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#Differentiable_manifolds "Manifold"), R is the ring of smooth [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") functions on M, and x is a point in M, then the set of all smooth functions f with _f_ (_x_) = 0 forms a prime ideal (even a maximal ideal) in R.

*   Consider the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") of the following two [quotients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_ring "Quotient ring")

![Image 19: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x,y]\to {\frac {\mathbb {C} [x,y]}{(x^{2}+y^{2}-1)}}\to {\frac {\mathbb {C} [x,y]}{(x^{2}+y^{2}-1,x)}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0952ec2890ea8b86cd3640c46cfc5d8a1cb5ab1e)Although the first two rings are integral domains (in fact the first is a UFD) the last is not an integral domain since it is [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_homomorphism "Ring homomorphism") to ![Image 20: {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathbb {C} [x,y]}{(x^{2}+y^{2}-1,x)}}\cong {\frac {\mathbb {C} [y]}{(y^{2}-1)}}\cong \mathbb {C} \times \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d76c089106548e8f68e426eb217e5d2a97abfd71)since ![Image 21: {\displaystyle (y^{2}-1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7a9dbfd34c2f81190198aabaa636fa9a08f7db35) factors into ![Image 22: {\displaystyle (y-1)(y+1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16193eaa9350d524c86cc2e32721a3a24b6ccb2d), which implies the existence of [zero divisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_divisor "Zero divisor") in the quotient ring, preventing it from being isomorphic to ![Image 23: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7) and instead to non-integral domain ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} \times \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db9f59e408c48acb7d240c1f8a0d829b8cfadd6e) (by the [Chinese remainder theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem#Statement "Chinese remainder theorem")).This shows that the ideal ![Image 25: {\displaystyle (x^{2}+y^{2}-1,x)\subset \mathbb {C} [x,y]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cc9a4e78cbf0b4f1f5c220bbe614fed5fb6e48b1) is not prime. (See the first property listed below.)
*   Another non-example is the ideal ![Image 26: {\displaystyle (2,x^{2}+5)\subset \mathbb {Z} [x]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e2edb92fffafef42e464dc36c520620b7d0c8d61) since we have

![Image 27: {\displaystyle x^{2}+5-2\cdot 3=(x-1)(x+1)\in (2,x^{2}+5)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87d4bc9a54bf7397410c2a49f56705fc7da31937)but neither ![Image 28: {\displaystyle x-1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0f1a88d34243b98b57c4df9db5724f61b59a4b9d) nor ![Image 29: {\displaystyle x+1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16df430ed7a23df9b160a5bbd957f306a0c3baa7) are elements of the ideal.
*   An ideal _I_ in the ring R (with [unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unital_ring "Unital ring")) is prime if and only if the [factor ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_ring "Factor ring")_R_/_I_ is an [integral domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_domain "Integral domain"). In particular, a commutative ring (with unity) is an integral domain if and only if (0) is a prime ideal. (The [zero ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_ring "Zero ring") has no prime ideals, because the ideal (0) is the whole ring.)
*   An ideal _I_ is prime if and only if its set-theoretic [complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory) "Complement (set theory)") is [multiplicatively closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicatively_closed_set "Multiplicatively closed set").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-3)
*   Every nonzero ring contains at least one prime ideal (in fact it contains at least one maximal ideal), which is a direct consequence of [Krull's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krull%27s_theorem "Krull's theorem").
*   More generally, if S is any multiplicatively closed set in R, then a lemma essentially due to Krull shows that there exists an ideal of R maximal with respect to being [disjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets "Disjoint sets") from S, and moreover the ideal must be prime. This can be further generalized to noncommutative rings (see below).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-Lam-4) In the case _S_ = {1}, we have [Krull's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krull%27s_theorem "Krull's theorem"), and this recovers the maximal ideals of R. Another prototypical m-system is the set, {_x_, _x_ 2, _x_ 3, _x_ 4, ...}, of all positive powers of a non-[nilpotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilpotent "Nilpotent") element.
*   The [preimage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage "Preimage") of a prime ideal under a [ring homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_homomorphism "Ring homomorphism") is a prime ideal. The analogous fact is not always true for [maximal ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_ideal "Maximal ideal"), which is one reason algebraic geometers define the [spectrum of a ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_a_ring "Spectrum of a ring") to be its set of prime rather than maximal ideals; one wants a homomorphism of rings to give a map between their spectra.
*   The set of all prime ideals (called the [spectrum of a ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_a_ring "Spectrum of a ring")) contains minimal elements (called [minimal prime ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_prime_ideal "Minimal prime ideal")). Geometrically, these correspond to irreducible components of the spectrum.
*   The sum of two prime ideals is not necessarily prime. For an example, consider the ring ![Image 30: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [x,y]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bef1bb44559f9eb88d544757f8f49058b6ef3374) with prime ideals _P_ = (_x_ 2 + _y_ 2 − 1) and _Q_ = (_x_) (the ideals generated by _x_ 2 + _y_ 2 − 1 and _x_ respectively). Their sum _P_ + _Q_ = (_x_ 2 + _y_ 2 − 1, _x_) = (_y_ 2 − 1, _x_) however is not prime: _y_ 2 − 1 = (_y_ − 1)(_y_ + 1) ∈ _P_ + _Q_ but its two factors are not. Alternatively, the quotient ring has [zero divisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_divisor "Zero divisor") so it is not an integral domain and thus _P_ + _Q_ cannot be prime.
*   Not every ideal which cannot be factored into two ideals is a prime ideal; e.g. ![Image 31: {\displaystyle (x,y^{2})\subset \mathbb {R} [x,y]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5494ede84357122a2ee3f4a0e1e8ac4a3b3dbfb) cannot be factored but is not prime.
*   In a commutative ring R with at least two elements, if every proper ideal is prime, then the ring is a field. (If the ideal (0) is prime, then the ring R is an integral domain. If q is any non-zero element of R and the ideal (_q_ 2) is prime, then it contains q and then q is [invertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_(ring_theory) "Unit (ring theory)").)
*   A nonzero principal ideal is prime if and only if it is generated by a [prime element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_element "Prime element"). In a UFD, every nonzero prime ideal contains a prime element.

One use of prime ideals occurs in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), where varieties are defined as the zero sets of ideals in polynomial rings. It turns out that the irreducible varieties correspond to prime ideals. In the modern abstract approach, one starts with an arbitrary commutative ring and turns the set of its prime ideals, also called its [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_a_ring "Spectrum of a ring"), into a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") and can thus define generalizations of varieties called [schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)"), which find applications not only in [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), but also in [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory").

The introduction of prime ideals in [algebraic number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number_theory "Algebraic number theory") was a major step forward: it was realized that the important property of unique factorisation expressed in the [fundamental theorem of arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic "Fundamental theorem of arithmetic") does not hold in every ring of [algebraic integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_integer "Algebraic integer"), but a substitute was found when [Richard Dedekind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dedekind "Richard Dedekind") replaced elements by ideals and prime elements by prime ideals; see [Dedekind domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_domain "Dedekind domain").

Prime ideals for noncommutative rings
-------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prime_ideal&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Prime ideals for noncommutative rings")]

The notion of a prime ideal can be generalized to noncommutative rings by using the commutative definition "ideal-wise". [Wolfgang Krull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Krull "Wolfgang Krull") advanced this idea in 1928.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-5) The following content can be found in texts such as Goodearl's[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-6) and Lam's.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-7) If R is a (possibly noncommutative) ring and P is a proper ideal of R, we say that P is **prime** if for any two ideals A and B of R:

*   If the product of ideals _AB_ is contained in P, then at least one of A and B is contained in P.

It can be shown that this definition is equivalent to the commutative one in commutative rings. It is readily verified that if an ideal of a noncommutative ring R satisfies the commutative definition of prime, then it also satisfies the noncommutative version. An ideal P satisfying the commutative definition of prime is sometimes called a **completely prime ideal** to distinguish it from other merely prime ideals in the ring. Completely prime ideals are prime ideals, but the [converse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_(logic) "Converse (logic)") is not true. For example, the zero ideal in the ring of _n_ × _n_[matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)") over a field is a prime ideal, but it is not completely prime.

This is close to the historical point of view of ideals as [ideal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_number "Ideal number"), as for the ring ![Image 32: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/449494a083e0a1fda2b61c62b2f09b6bee4633dc) "A is contained in P" is another way of saying "P divides A", and the unit ideal R represents unity.

Equivalent formulations of the ideal _P_ ≠ _R_ being prime include the following properties:

*   For all a and b in R, (_a_)(_b_) ⊆ _P_ implies _a_ ∈ _P_ or _b_ ∈ _P_.
*   For any two _right_ ideals of R, _AB_ ⊆ _P_ implies _A_ ⊆ _P_ or _B_ ⊆ _P_.
*   For any two _left_ ideals of R, _AB_ ⊆ _P_ implies _A_ ⊆ _P_ or _B_ ⊆ _P_.
*   For any elements a and b of R, if _aRb_ ⊆ _P_, then _a_ ∈ _P_ or _b_ ∈ _P_.

Prime ideals in commutative rings are characterized by having multiplicatively closed [complements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory) "Complement (set theory)") in R, and with slight modification, a similar characterization can be formulated for prime ideals in noncommutative rings. A [nonempty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set "Empty set") subset _S_ ⊆ _R_ is called an **m-system** if for any a and b in S, there exists r in R such that _arb_ is in S.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-8) The following item can then be added to the list of equivalent conditions above:

*   The complement _R_∖_P_ is an m-system.

*   Any [primitive ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_ideal "Primitive ideal") is prime.
*   As with commutative rings, maximal ideals are prime, and also prime ideals contain minimal prime ideals.
*   A ring is a [prime ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ring "Prime ring") if and only if the zero ideal is a prime ideal, and moreover a ring is a [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_domain "Integral domain") if and only if the zero ideal is a completely prime ideal.
*   Another fact from commutative theory echoed in noncommutative theory is that if A is a nonzero R-[module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics) "Module (mathematics)"), and P is a maximal element in the [poset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poset "Poset") of [annihilator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilator_(ring_theory) "Annihilator (ring theory)") ideals of submodules of A, then P is prime.

*   **[Prime avoidance lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_avoidance_lemma "Prime avoidance lemma").** If R is a commutative ring, and A is a [subring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subring "Subring") (possibly without unity), and _I_ 1, ..., _I n_ is a collection of ideals of R with at most two members not prime, then if A is not contained in any _I j_, it is also not contained in the [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory) "Union (set theory)") of _I_ 1, ..., _I n_.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-9) In particular, A could be an ideal of R.
*   If S is any m-system in R, then a lemma essentially due to Krull shows that there exists an ideal I of R maximal with respect to being disjoint from S, and moreover the ideal I must be prime (the primality of I can be [proved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof "Mathematical proof") as follows: if ![Image 33: {\displaystyle a,b\not \in I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/491bbb32b673cb4c0c24adae955dc0b1f7b8fc50), then there exist elements ![Image 34: {\displaystyle s,t\in S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5cef58c646b1df37d9f7bc0eacc49d8eddac37ea) such that ![Image 35: {\displaystyle s\in I+(a),t\in I+(b)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d38913b8e8a5147fd918e95dec21ec69334bced0) by the maximal property of I. Now, if ![Image 36: {\displaystyle (a)(b)\subset I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68bcc335573454d2ea2c905a94eab1fe6b6d17fd), then ![Image 37: {\displaystyle st\in (I+(a))(I+(b))\subset I+(a)(b)\subset I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8a90579cbfb1afee361dd1ffd5a2ca864f654bbd), which is a contradiction).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-Lam-4) In the case _S_ = {1}, we have [Krull's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krull%27s_theorem "Krull's theorem"), and this recovers the maximal ideals of R. Another prototypical m-system is the set, {_x_, _x_ 2, _x_ 3, _x_ 4, ...}, of all positive powers of a non-[nilpotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilpotent "Nilpotent") element.
*   For a prime ideal P, the complement _R_∖_P_ has another property beyond being an m-system. If _xy_ is in _R_∖_P_, then both x and y must be in _R_∖_P_, since P is an ideal. A set that contains the divisors of its elements is called **saturated**.
*   For a commutative ring R, there is a kind of converse for the previous statement: If S is any nonempty saturated and multiplicatively closed subset of R, the complement _R_∖_S_ is the union of prime ideals of R.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-10)
*   The [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory) "Intersection (set theory)") of members of a chain of prime ideals is a prime ideal, and in a commutative ring the union of members of a chain of prime ideals is a prime ideal. With [Zorn's Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorn%27s_Lemma "Zorn's Lemma"), these observations imply that the poset of prime ideals of a commutative ring (partially ordered by inclusion) has maximal and minimal elements.

Connection to maximality

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prime_ideal&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Connection to maximality")]

Prime ideals can frequently be produced as maximal elements of certain collections of ideals. For example:

*   An ideal maximal with respect to having empty intersection with a fixed m-system is prime.
*   An ideal maximal among [annihilators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilator_(ring_theory) "Annihilator (ring theory)") of submodules of a fixed R-module M is prime.
*   In a commutative ring, an ideal maximal with respect to being non-principal is prime.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-11)
*   In a commutative ring, an ideal maximal with respect to being not countably generated is prime.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal#cite_note-12)
