These include as special cases the Pythagorean means ( arithmetic , geometric , and harmonic means ).

Definition [ edit ] If p is a non-zero real number , and x 1 , … … , x n {\displaystyle x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}} are positive real numbers , then the generalized mean or power mean with exponent p of these positive real numbers is [ 2 ] [ 3 ] M p ( x 1 , … … , x n ) = ( 1 n ∑ ∑ i = 1 n x i p ) 1 / p .

{\displaystyle M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})=\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{p}\right)^{{1}/{p}}.} (See p -norm ). For p = 0 we set it equal to the geometric mean (which is the limit of means with exponents approaching zero, as proved below): M 0 ( x 1 , … … , x n ) = ( ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i ) 1 / n .

{\displaystyle M_{0}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})=\left(\prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\right)^{1/n}.} Furthermore, for a sequence of positive weights w i we define the weighted power mean as [ 2 ] M p ( x 1 , … … , x n ) = ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i ) 1 / p {\displaystyle M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})=\left({\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}}{\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}}}\right)^{{1}/{p}}} and when p = 0 , it is equal to the weighted geometric mean : M 0 ( x 1 , … … , x n ) = ( ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i w i ) 1 / ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i .

{\displaystyle M_{0}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})=\left(\prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{w_{i}}\right)^{1/\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}}.} The unweighted means correspond to setting all w i = 1 .

Special cases [ edit ] For some values of p {\displaystyle p} , the mean M p ( x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} corresponds to a well known mean.

{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}=1.} We can rewrite the definition of M p {\displaystyle M_{p}} using the exponential function as M p ( x 1 , … … , x n ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( ln ⁡ ⁡ [ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ) 1 / p ] ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( ln ⁡ ⁡ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ) p ) {\displaystyle M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})=\exp {\left(\ln {\left[\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}\right)^{1/p}\right]}\right)}=\exp {\left({\frac {\ln {\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}\right)}}{p}}\right)}} In the limit p → 0 , we can apply L'Hôpital's rule to the argument of the exponential function. We assume that p ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle p\in \mathbb {R} } but p ≠ 0 , and that the sum of w i is equal to 1 (without loss in generality); [ 4 ] Differentiating the numerator and denominator with respect to p , we have lim p → → 0 ln ⁡ ⁡ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ) p = lim p → → 0 ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ln ⁡ ⁡ x i ∑ ∑ j = 1 n w j x j p 1 = lim p → → 0 ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ln ⁡ ⁡ x i ∑ ∑ j = 1 n w j x j p = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i ln ⁡ ⁡ x i ∑ ∑ j = 1 n w j = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i ln ⁡ ⁡ x i = ln ⁡ ⁡ ( ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i w i ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lim _{p\to 0}{\frac {\ln {\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}\right)}}{p}}&=\lim _{p\to 0}{\frac {\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}\ln {x_{i}}}{\sum _{j=1}^{n}w_{j}x_{j}^{p}}}{1}}\\&=\lim _{p\to 0}{\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}\ln {x_{i}}}{\sum _{j=1}^{n}w_{j}x_{j}^{p}}}\\&={\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\ln {x_{i}}}{\sum _{j=1}^{n}w_{j}}}\\&=\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\ln {x_{i}}\\&=\ln {\left(\prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{w_{i}}\right)}\end{aligned}}} By the continuity of the exponential function, we can substitute back into the above relation to obtain lim p → → 0 M p ( x 1 , … … , x n ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( ln ⁡ ⁡ ( ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i w i ) ) = ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i w i = M 0 ( x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle \lim _{p\to 0}M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})=\exp {\left(\ln {\left(\prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{w_{i}}\right)}\right)}=\prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{w_{i}}=M_{0}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} as desired.

[ 2 ] Proof of lim p → → ∞ ∞ M p = M ∞ ∞ {\textstyle \lim _{p\to \infty }M_{p}=M_{\infty }} and lim p → → − − ∞ ∞ M p = M − − ∞ ∞ {\textstyle \lim _{p\to -\infty }M_{p}=M_{-\infty }} Assume (possibly after relabeling and combining terms together) that x 1 ≥ ≥ ⋯ ⋯ ≥ ≥ x n {\displaystyle x_{1}\geq \dots \geq x_{n}} . Then lim p → → ∞ ∞ M p ( x 1 , … … , x n ) = lim p → → ∞ ∞ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ) 1 / p = x 1 lim p → → ∞ ∞ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i ( x i x 1 ) p ) 1 / p = x 1 = M ∞ ∞ ( x 1 , … … , x n ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lim _{p\to \infty }M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})&=\lim _{p\to \infty }\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}\right)^{1/p}\\&=x_{1}\lim _{p\to \infty }\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\left({\frac {x_{i}}{x_{1}}}\right)^{p}\right)^{1/p}\\&=x_{1}=M_{\infty }(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}).\end{aligned}}} The formula for M − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle M_{-\infty }} follows from M − − ∞ ∞ ( x 1 , … … , x n ) = 1 M ∞ ∞ ( 1 / x 1 , … … , 1 / x n ) = x n .

{\displaystyle M_{-\infty }(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})={\frac {1}{M_{\infty }(1/x_{1},\dots ,1/x_{n})}}=x_{n}.} Properties [ edit ] Let x 1 , … … , x n {\displaystyle x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}} be a sequence of positive real numbers, then the following properties hold: [ 1 ] min ( x 1 , … … , x n ) ≤ ≤ M p ( x 1 , … … , x n ) ≤ ≤ max ( x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle \min(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})\leq M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})\leq \max(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} .

Each generalized mean always lies between the smallest and largest of the x values.

M p ( x 1 , … … , x n ) = M p ( P ( x 1 , … … , x n ) ) {\displaystyle M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})=M_{p}(P(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}))} , where P {\displaystyle P} is a permutation operator.

Each generalized mean is a symmetric function of its arguments; permuting the arguments of a generalized mean does not change its value.

M p ( b x 1 , … … , b x n ) = b ⋅ ⋅ M p ( x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle M_{p}(bx_{1},\dots ,bx_{n})=b\cdot M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} .

Like most means , the generalized mean is a homogeneous function of its arguments x 1 , ..., x n . That is, if b is a positive real number, then the generalized mean with exponent p of the numbers b ⋅ ⋅ x 1 , … … , b ⋅ ⋅ x n {\displaystyle b\cdot x_{1},\dots ,b\cdot x_{n}} is equal to b times the generalized mean of the numbers x 1 , ..., x n .

M p ( x 1 , … … , x n ⋅ ⋅ k ) = M p [ M p ( x 1 , … … , x k ) , M p ( x k + 1 , … … , x 2 ⋅ ⋅ k ) , … … , M p ( x ( n − − 1 ) ⋅ ⋅ k + 1 , … … , x n ⋅ ⋅ k ) ] {\displaystyle M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n\cdot k})=M_{p}\left[M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{k}),M_{p}(x_{k+1},\dots ,x_{2\cdot k}),\dots ,M_{p}(x_{(n-1)\cdot k+1},\dots ,x_{n\cdot k})\right]} .

Like the quasi-arithmetic means , the computation of the mean can be split into computations of equal sized sub-blocks. This enables use of a divide and conquer algorithm to calculate the means, when desirable.

Generalized mean inequality [ edit ] Geometric proof without words that max ( a , b ) > root mean square ( RMS ) or quadratic mean ( QM ) > arithmetic mean ( AM ) > geometric mean ( GM ) > harmonic mean ( HM ) > min ( a , b ) of two distinct positive numbers a and b [ note 1 ] In general, if p < q , then M p ( x 1 , … … , x n ) ≤ ≤ M q ( x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})\leq M_{q}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} and the two means are equal if and only if x 1 = x 2 = ... = x n .

The inequality is true for real values of p and q , as well as positive and negative infinity values.

It follows from the fact that, for all real p , ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ p M p ( x 1 , … … , x n ) ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial p}}M_{p}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})\geq 0} which can be proved using Jensen's inequality .

In particular, for p in {−1, 0, 1} , the generalized mean inequality implies the Pythagorean means inequality as well as the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means .

Proof of the weighted inequality [ edit ] We will prove the weighted power mean inequality. For the purpose of the proof we will assume the following without loss of generality : w i ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i = 1 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}w_{i}\in [0,1]\\\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}=1\end{aligned}}} The proof for unweighted power means can be easily obtained by substituting w i = 1/ n .

Equivalence of inequalities between means of opposite signs [ edit ] Suppose an average between power means with exponents p and q holds: ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ) 1 / p ≥ ≥ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i q ) 1 / q {\displaystyle \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}\right)^{1/p}\geq \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{q}\right)^{1/q}} applying this, then: ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ) 1 / p ≥ ≥ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i q ) 1 / q {\displaystyle \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {w_{i}}{x_{i}^{p}}}\right)^{1/p}\geq \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {w_{i}}{x_{i}^{q}}}\right)^{1/q}} We raise both sides to the power of −1 (strictly decreasing function in positive reals): ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i − − p ) − − 1 / p = ( 1 ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i 1 x i p ) 1 / p ≤ ≤ ( 1 ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i 1 x i q ) 1 / q = ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i − − q ) − − 1 / q {\displaystyle \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{-p}\right)^{-1/p}=\left({\frac {1}{\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}{\frac {1}{x_{i}^{p}}}}}\right)^{1/p}\leq \left({\frac {1}{\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}{\frac {1}{x_{i}^{q}}}}}\right)^{1/q}=\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{-q}\right)^{-1/q}} We get the inequality for means with exponents − p and − q , and we can use the same reasoning backwards, thus proving the inequalities to be equivalent, which will be used in some of the later proofs.

Geometric mean [ edit ] For any q > 0 and non-negative weights summing to 1, the following inequality holds: ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i − − q ) − − 1 / q ≤ ≤ ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i w i ≤ ≤ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i q ) 1 / q .

{\displaystyle \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{-q}\right)^{-1/q}\leq \prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{w_{i}}\leq \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{q}\right)^{1/q}.} The proof follows from Jensen's inequality , making use of the fact the logarithm is concave: log ⁡ ⁡ ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i w i = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i log ⁡ ⁡ x i ≤ ≤ log ⁡ ⁡ ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i .

{\displaystyle \log \prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{w_{i}}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\log x_{i}\leq \log \sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}.} By applying the exponential function to both sides and observing that as a strictly increasing function it preserves the sign of the inequality, we get ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i w i ≤ ≤ ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i .

{\displaystyle \prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{w_{i}}\leq \sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}.} Taking q -th powers of the x i yields ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i q ⋅ ⋅ w i ≤ ≤ ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i q ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i w i ≤ ≤ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i q ) 1 / q .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{q{\cdot }w_{i}}\leq \sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{q}\\&\prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{w_{i}}\leq \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{q}\right)^{1/q}.\end{aligned}}} Thus, we are done for the inequality with positive q ; the case for negatives is identical but for the swapped signs in the last step: ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i − − q ⋅ ⋅ w i ≤ ≤ ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i − − q .

{\displaystyle \prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{-q{\cdot }w_{i}}\leq \sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{-q}.} Of course, taking each side to the power of a negative number -1/ q swaps the direction of the inequality.

∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i w i ≥ ≥ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i − − q ) − − 1 / q .

{\displaystyle \prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{w_{i}}\geq \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{-q}\right)^{-1/q}.} Inequality between any two power means [ edit ] We are to prove that for any p < q the following inequality holds: ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ) 1 / p ≤ ≤ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i q ) 1 / q {\displaystyle \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}\right)^{1/p}\leq \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{q}\right)^{1/q}} if p is negative, and q is positive, the inequality is equivalent to the one proved above: ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ) 1 / p ≤ ≤ ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i w i ≤ ≤ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i q ) 1 / q {\displaystyle \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}\right)^{1/p}\leq \prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{w_{i}}\leq \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{q}\right)^{1/q}} The proof for positive p and q is as follows: Define the following function: f : R + → R + f ( x ) = x q p {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{\frac {q}{p}}} .

f is a power function, so it does have a second derivative : f ″ ( x ) = ( q p ) ( q p − − 1 ) x q p − − 2 {\displaystyle f''(x)=\left({\frac {q}{p}}\right)\left({\frac {q}{p}}-1\right)x^{{\frac {q}{p}}-2}} which is strictly positive within the domain of f , since q > p , so we know f is convex.

Using this, and the Jensen's inequality we get: f ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ) ≤ ≤ ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i f ( x i p ) ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ) q / p ≤ ≤ ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i q {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}\right)&\leq \sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}f(x_{i}^{p})\\[3pt]\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}\right)^{q/p}&\leq \sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{q}\end{aligned}}} after raising both side to the power of 1/ q (an increasing function, since 1/ q is positive) we get the inequality which was to be proven: ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i p ) 1 / p ≤ ≤ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n w i x i q ) 1 / q {\displaystyle \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{p}\right)^{1/p}\leq \left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}^{q}\right)^{1/q}} Using the previously shown equivalence we can prove the inequality for negative p and q by replacing them with −q and −p , respectively.

Generalized f -mean [ edit ] Main article: Generalized f -mean The power mean could be generalized further to the generalized f -mean : M f ( x 1 , … … , x n ) = f − − 1 ( 1 n ⋅ ⋅ ∑ ∑ i = 1 n f ( x i ) ) {\displaystyle M_{f}(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})=f^{-1}\left({{\frac {1}{n}}\cdot \sum _{i=1}^{n}{f(x_{i})}}\right)} This covers the geometric mean without using a limit with f ( x ) = log( x ) . The power mean is obtained for f ( x ) = x p . Properties of these means are studied in de Carvalho (2016).

[ 3 ] Applications [ edit ] Signal processing [ edit ] A power mean serves a non-linear moving average which is shifted towards small signal values for small p and emphasizes big signal values for big p . Given an efficient implementation of a moving arithmetic mean called smooth one can implement a moving power mean according to the following Haskell code.

powerSmooth :: Floating a => ([ a ] -> [ a ]) -> a -> [ a ] -> [ a ] powerSmooth smooth p = map ( ** recip p ) .

smooth .

map ( ** p ) For big p it can serve as an envelope detector on a rectified signal.

For small p it can serve as a baseline detector on a mass spectrum .
