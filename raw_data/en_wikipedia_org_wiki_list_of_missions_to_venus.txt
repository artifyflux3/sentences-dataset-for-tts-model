There have been 46 space missions to the planet Venus (including gravity-assist flybys). Missions to Venus constitute part of the exploration of Venus . The Soviet Union , followed by the United States , have soft landed probes on the surface. Venera 7 was the first lander overall and first for the Soviet Union, touching down on 15 December 1970.

Pioneer Venus 2 contained the first spacecraft to land from the United States, the Day Probe. It soft landed on 9 December 1978.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The most recent lander was part of the Vega 2 mission, which soft landed on 15 June 1985.

List [ edit ] As of 2020, the Soviet Union , United States , European Space Agency and Japan have conducted missions to Venus.
