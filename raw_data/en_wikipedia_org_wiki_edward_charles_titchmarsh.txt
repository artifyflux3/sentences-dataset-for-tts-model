H. Hardy [ 2 ] Doctoral students Lionel Cooper John Bryce McLeod [ 2 ] Frederick Valentine Atkinson [ 2 ] Edward Charles " Ted " Titchmarsh (June 1, 1899 – January 18, 1963) was a leading British mathematician.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Education [ edit ] Titchmarsh was educated at King Edward VII School (Sheffield) and Balliol College, Oxford , where he began his studies in October 1917.

Career [ edit ] Titchmarsh was known for work in analytic number theory , Fourier analysis and other parts of mathematical analysis . He wrote several classic books in these areas; his book on the Riemann zeta-function was reissued in a 1986 edition edited by Roger Heath-Brown .

Titchmarsh was Savilian Professor of Geometry at the University of Oxford from 1932 to 1963. He was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1954 in Amsterdam.

He was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1935-1947.
