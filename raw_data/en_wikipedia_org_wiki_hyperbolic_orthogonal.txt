Euclidean [orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality "Orthogonality") is preserved by rotation in the left diagram; hyperbolic orthogonality with respect to hyperbola (B) is preserved by [hyperbolic rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_rotation "Hyperbolic rotation") in the right diagram.

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), given a pair of [conjugate hyperbolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_hyperbola "Conjugate hyperbola"), two [conjugate diameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_diameters "Conjugate diameters") are **hyperbolically orthogonal**. This relationship of diameters was described by [Apollonius of Perga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga") and has been modernized using [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"). Hyperbolically orthogonal lines appear in [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") as temporal and spatial directions that show the [relativity of simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity "Relativity of simultaneity").

Keeping time and space axes hyperbolically orthogonal, as in [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"), gives a constant result when measurements are taken of the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light").

Two lines are **hyperbolic orthogonal** when they are [reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)") of each other over the asymptote of a given [hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola"). Two particular hyperbolas are frequently used in the plane:

1.   _xy_ = 1 with _y_ = 0 as asymptote. 
When reflected in the x-axis, a line _y_ = _mx_ becomes _y_ = −_mx_.

 In this case the lines are hyperbolic orthogonal if their [slopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") are [additive inverses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_inverse "Additive inverse").
2.   _x_ 2 − _y_ 2 = 1 with _y_ = _x_ as asymptote. For lines _y_ = _mx_ with −1 <_m_< 1, when _x_ = 1/_m_, then _y_ = 1. The point (1/_m_ , 1) on the line is reflected across _y_ = _x_ to (1, 1/_m_). Therefore the reflected line has slope 1/m and the slopes of hyperbolic orthogonal lines are [reciprocals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse") of each other.

The relation of hyperbolic orthogonality actually applies to classes of parallel lines in the plane, where any particular line can represent the class. Thus, for a given hyperbola and asymptote _A_, a pair of lines (_a_, _b_) are hyperbolic orthogonal if there is a pair (_c_, _d_) such that ![Image 2: {\displaystyle a\rVert c,\ b\rVert d}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c2351cca4d6aa228d4aea5ab3e5c5106c8784460), and _c_ is the reflection of _d_ across _A_.

Similar to the perpendularity of a circle radius to the [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent "Tangent"), a radius to a hyperbola is hyperbolic orthogonal to a tangent to the hyperbola.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic-orthogonal#cite_note-L&W-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic-orthogonal#cite_note-2)

A [bilinear form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_form "Bilinear form") is used to describe orthogonality in analytic geometry, with two elements orthogonal when their bilinear form vanishes. In the plane of [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number")![Image 3: {\displaystyle z_{1}=u+iv,\quad z_{2}=x+iy}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8caa0b806f60363135b3cfb526cc1d4c6e035fa2), the bilinear form is ![Image 4: {\displaystyle xu+yv}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e9d0a6a97856e7026bfcd9bd444dba5d51e20882), while in the plane of [hyperbolic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_number "Hyperbolic number")![Image 5: {\displaystyle w_{1}=u+jv,\quad w_{2}=x+jy,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/27c2699f37b7aa75258faaf49bbf057a9b83badb) the bilinear form is ![Image 6: {\displaystyle xu-yv.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/24585678aa8cd079010930209f0643086545c239)

The vectors _z_ 1 and _z_ 2 in the complex number plane, and _w_ 1 and _w_ 2 in the hyperbolic number plane are said to be respectively _Euclidean orthogonal_ or _hyperbolic orthogonal_ if their respective inner products [bilinear forms] are zero.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic-orthogonal#cite_note-3)
The bilinear form may be computed as the real part of the complex product of one number with the conjugate of the other. Then

![Image 7: {\displaystyle z_{1}z_{2}^{*}+z_{1}^{*}z_{2}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7418552c5438c576e7778c3a69e8c27b2d6ca1b8) entails perpendicularity in the complex plane, while![Image 8: {\displaystyle w_{1}w_{2}^{*}+w_{1}^{*}w_{2}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c99a1fcb63aff9b21ee943c211e1a64fdc1f0f4c) implies the _w'_ s are hyperbolic orthogonal.
The notion of hyperbolic orthogonality arose in [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry") in consideration of [conjugate diameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_diameters "Conjugate diameters") of ellipses and hyperbolas.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic-orthogonal#cite_note-4) If _g_ and _g_′ represent the slopes of the conjugate diameters, then ![Image 9: {\displaystyle gg'=-{\frac {b^{2}}{a^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38743041abbc64bab4499747fc40c47ba1ec375c) in the case of an ellipse and ![Image 10: {\displaystyle gg'={\frac {b^{2}}{a^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e6d29f04a72473d5b790093cad392b9eafa287d) in the case of a hyperbola. When _a_ = _b_ the ellipse is a circle and the conjugate diameters are perpendicular while the hyperbola is rectangular and the conjugate diameters are hyperbolic-orthogonal.

In the terminology of [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"), the operation of taking the hyperbolic orthogonal line is an [involution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics) "Involution (mathematics)"). Suppose the slope of a vertical line is denoted ∞ so that all lines have a slope in the [projectively extended real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectively_extended_real_line "Projectively extended real line"). Then whichever hyperbola (A) or (B) is used, the operation is an example of a [hyperbolic involution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)#Projective_geometry "Involution (mathematics)") where the asymptote is invariant. Hyperbolically orthogonal lines lie in different sectors of the plane, determined by the asymptotes of the hyperbola, thus the relation of hyperbolic orthogonality is a [heterogeneous relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_relation "Heterogeneous relation") on sets of lines in the plane.

Constant light speed
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperbolic_orthogonality&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Constant light speed")]

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Minkowski-Diagramm_-_asymmetrisch.png/250px-Minkowski-Diagramm_-_asymmetrisch.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minkowski-Diagramm_-_asymmetrisch.png)

_A_ represents an event connected by light to the origin. The hyperbolically-orthogonal blue axes have coordinates that measure light speed as the same ratio as the rectangular coordinates of the rest frame.

One of the premises of relativity is that the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") does not depend on the [inertial frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference") in which the measurements are done. This premise has been associated with null results in the [Michaelson–Morley experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment "Michaelson–Morley experiment"). As long as space and time axes are hyperbolically orthogonal, the measurement of the speed of light will give the same result. The seeming paradox of light speed invariance with respect to moving observers is resolved in special relativity by this feature of [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space").

Since [Hermann Minkowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski "Hermann Minkowski")'s foundation for [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") study in 1908, the concept of points in a spacetime plane being hyperbolic-orthogonal to a timeline (tangent to a [world line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line "World line")) has been used to define **simultaneity** of events relative to the timeline, or [relativity of simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity "Relativity of simultaneity"). In Minkowski's development the hyperbola of type (B) above is in use.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic-orthogonal#cite_note-5) Two vectors (x 1, y 1, z 1, t 1) and (x 2, y 2, z 2, t 2) are _normal_ (meaning hyperbolic orthogonal) when

![Image 12: {\displaystyle c^{2}\ t_{1}\ t_{2}-x_{1}\ x_{2}-y_{1}\ y_{2}-z_{1}\ z_{2}=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4a7777f3ac54cda949c47df1a8b73783451983f)
When c = 1 and the y s and z s are zero, x 1 ≠ 0, t 2 ≠ 0, then ![Image 13: {\displaystyle {\frac {c\ t_{1}}{x_{1}}}={\frac {x_{2}}{c\ t_{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9a0069e9f1b5ccf99aab5ac9b809a51d1c01444e).

Given a hyperbola with asymptote _A_, its reflection in _A_ produces the [conjugate hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_hyperbola "Conjugate hyperbola"). Any diameter of the original hyperbola is reflected to a [conjugate diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_diameters "Conjugate diameters"). The directions indicated by conjugate diameters are taken for space and time axes in relativity. As [E. T. Whittaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._T._Whittaker "E. T. Whittaker") wrote in 1910, "[the] hyperbola is unaltered when any pair of conjugate diameters are taken as new axes, and a new unit of length is taken proportional to the length of either of these diameters."[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic-orthogonal#cite_note-6) On this [principle of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity "Principle of relativity"), he then wrote the Lorentz transformation in the modern form using [rapidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidity "Rapidity").

[Edwin Bidwell Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Bidwell_Wilson "Edwin Bidwell Wilson") and [Gilbert N. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_N._Lewis "Gilbert N. Lewis") developed the concept within [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry") in 1912. They note "in our plane no pair of perpendicular [hyperbolic-orthogonal] lines is better suited to serve as coordinate axes than any other pair"[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic-orthogonal#cite_note-L&W-1)
