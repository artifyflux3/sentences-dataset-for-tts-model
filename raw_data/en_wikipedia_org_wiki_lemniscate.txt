For other uses, see Lemniscate (disambiguation) .

The lemniscate of Bernoulli and its two foci In algebraic geometry , a lemniscate ( / l ɛ m ˈ n ɪ s k ɪ t / or / ˈ l ɛ m n ɪ s ˌ k eɪ t , - k ɪ t / ) [ 1 ] is any of several figure-eight or ∞ -shaped curves .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The word comes from the Latin lēmniscātus , meaning "decorated with ribbons", [ 4 ] from the Greek λημνίσκος ( lēmnískos ), meaning "ribbon", [ 3 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] or which alternatively may refer to the wool from which the ribbons were made.

[ 2 ] Curves that have been called a lemniscate include three quartic plane curves : the hippopede or lemniscate of Booth , the lemniscate of Bernoulli , and the lemniscate of Gerono . The hippopede was studied by Proclus (5th century), but the term "lemniscate" was not used until the work of Jacob Bernoulli in the late 17th century.

History and examples [ edit ] Lemniscate of Booth [ edit ] Lemniscate of Booth Main article: Hippopede The consideration of curves with a figure-eight shape can be traced back to Proclus , a Greek Neoplatonist philosopher and mathematician who lived in the 5th century AD. Proclus considered the cross-sections of a torus by a plane parallel to the axis of the torus. As he observed, for most such sections the cross section consists of either one or two ovals; however, when the plane is tangent to the inner surface of the torus, the cross-section takes on a figure-eight shape, which Proclus called a horse fetter (a device for holding two feet of a horse together), or "hippopede" in Greek.

[ 8 ] The name "lemniscate of Booth" for this curve dates to its study by the 19th-century mathematician James Booth .

[ 2 ] The lemniscate may be defined as an algebraic curve , the zero set of the quartic polynomial ( x 2 + y 2 ) 2 − − c x 2 − − d y 2 {\displaystyle (x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}-cx^{2}-dy^{2}} when the parameter d is negative (or zero for the special case where the lemniscate becomes a pair of externally tangent circles). For positive values of d one instead obtains the oval of Booth .

Lemniscate of Bernoulli [ edit ] Lemniscate of Bernoulli Main article: Lemniscate of Bernoulli In 1680, Cassini studied a family of curves, now called the Cassini oval , defined as follows: the locus of all points, the product of whose distances from two fixed points, the curves' foci , is a constant. Under very particular circumstances (when the half-distance between the points is equal to the square root of the constant) this gives rise to a lemniscate.

In 1694, Johann Bernoulli studied the lemniscate case of the Cassini oval, now known as the lemniscate of Bernoulli (shown above), in connection with a problem of " isochrones " that had been posed earlier by Leibniz . Like the hippopede, it is an algebraic curve, the zero set of the polynomial ( x 2 + y 2 ) 2 − − a 2 ( x 2 − − y 2 ) {\displaystyle (x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}-a^{2}(x^{2}-y^{2})} . Bernoulli's brother Jacob Bernoulli also studied the same curve in the same year, and gave it its name, the lemniscate.

[ 9 ] It may also be defined geometrically as the locus of points whose product of distances from two foci equals the square of half the interfocal distance.

[ 10 ] It is a special case of the hippopede (lemniscate of Booth), with d = − − c {\displaystyle d=-c} , and may be formed as a cross-section of a torus whose inner hole and circular cross-sections have the same diameter as each other.

[ 2 ] The lemniscatic elliptic functions are analogues of trigonometric functions for the lemniscate of Bernoulli, and the lemniscate constants arise in evaluating the arc length of this lemniscate.

Lemniscate of Gerono [ edit ] Main article: Lemniscate of Gerono Lemniscate of Gerono: solution set of x 4 − x 2 + y 2 = 0 [ 11 ] Another lemniscate, the lemniscate of Gerono or lemniscate of Huygens, is the zero set of the quartic polynomial y 2 − − x 2 ( a 2 − − x 2 ) {\displaystyle y^{2}-x^{2}(a^{2}-x^{2})} .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Viviani's curve , a three-dimensional curve formed by intersecting a sphere with a cylinder, also has a figure eight shape, and has the lemniscate of Gerono as its planar projection.

[ 14 ] Others [ edit ] Other figure-eight shaped algebraic curves include The Devil's curve , a curve defined by the quartic equation y 2 ( y 2 − − a 2 ) = x 2 ( x 2 − − b 2 ) {\displaystyle y^{2}(y^{2}-a^{2})=x^{2}(x^{2}-b^{2})} in which one connected component has a figure-eight shape, [ 15 ] Watt's curve , a figure-eight shaped curve formed by a mechanical linkage. Watt's curve is the zero set of the degree-six polynomial equation ( x 2 + y 2 ) ( x 2 + y 2 − − d 2 ) 2 + 4 a 2 y 2 ( x 2 + y 2 − − b 2 ) = 0 {\displaystyle (x^{2}+y^{2})(x^{2}+y^{2}-d^{2})^{2}+4a^{2}y^{2}(x^{2}+y^{2}-b^{2})=0} and has the lemniscate of Bernoulli as a special case.
