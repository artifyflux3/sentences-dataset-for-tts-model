Petković Born February 10, 1948 ( 1948-02-10 ) (age 77) Niš, Serbia Nationality Serbian Alma mater University of Nis Occupation Mathematician Known for Interval mathematics , Solving nonlinear equations , Polynomial roots , Recreational mathematics Miodrag S. Petković (born 10 February 1948 in Niš, Serbia in the former Yugoslavia ) is a mathematician and computer scientist. In 1991 he became a full professor of mathematics at the Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Niš in Serbia .

Biography [ edit ] Petković specializes in the theory of iterative processes for solving nonlinear equations and Interval mathematics . He wrote 270 academic papers (153 in Clarivate Analytics ' SCI journals) and 28 books, 
including four monographs Iterative Methods for Simultaneous Inclusion of Polynomial Zeros (Springer-Verlag 1989), Complex Interval Arithmetic and Its Applications (Wiley-VCH 1998), Point Estimation of Root Finding Methods (Springer-Verlag 2008), and Multipoint Methods for Solving Nonlinear Equations (Elsevier 2013). Petković papers were cited 1193 times [ 1 ] with Hirsch index h=20, while Elsevier's Reference Manager Mendeley displays 1565 citations and h=21.

[ 2 ] He was visiting professor at the University of Oldenburg from 1989 to 2001, the Louis Pasteur University , Strasbourg (France, 1992), the University of Tsukuba (Japan, 2001), and a scientific researcher/invited lecturer at Columbia University , Harvard University , and at the universities of Freiburg , Zurich ( ETH ), Oldenburg , Berlin ( Humboldt University ), London , Sofia , Kiel , Tokyo , Tsukuba , Nagoya and Vienna . He took part at 60 conferences and congresses, and he was the invited lecturer on two world's congresses in 1992 and 1996,  and several international conferences. He was a co-organizer of the international conference at the University of Kiel (Germany) 1998.

[ 3 ] Petković is an Associate Editor in Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics [ 4 ] and Applied Mathematics and Computation [ 5 ] and a member of editorial board of Reliable Computing , Journal of Applied Mathematics , Journal of Mathematics and Computing Systems , Journal of Complex Analysis , Mathematical Aeterna , and Novi Sad J. Math .

Petković is a member of the Serbian Scientific Society, New York Academy of Science , American Mathematical Society , GAMM, and was a member of the Serbian National Council of Science from 2010 to 2015.
