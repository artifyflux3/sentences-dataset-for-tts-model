**Rotational frequency**, also known as **rotational speed** or **rate of rotation** (symbols _ν_, lowercase Greek [nu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_(letter) "Nu (letter)"), and also _n_), is the [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") of [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation") of an object [around an axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis "Rotation around a fixed axis"). Its [SI unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_unit "SI unit") is the [reciprocal seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_second "Reciprocal second") (s−1); other common [units of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement "Units of measurement") include the [hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz "Hertz") (Hz), [cycles per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycles_per_second "Cycles per second") (cps), and [revolutions per minute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute "Revolutions per minute") (rpm).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_velocity#cite_note-1)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_velocity#cite_note-3)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_velocity#cite_note-5)

Rotational frequency can be obtained dividing _[angular frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular\_frequency "Angular frequency")_, ω, by a full [turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(unit) "Turn (unit)") (2[π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi")[radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radians "Radians")): _ν_=ω/(2π rad). It can also be formulated as the [instantaneous rate of change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instantaneous_rate_of_change "Instantaneous rate of change") of the [number of rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_rotations "Number of rotations"), _N_, with respect to time, _t_: _n_=d _N_/d _t_ (as per [International System of Quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Quantities "International System of Quantities")).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_velocity#cite_note-ISO80000-3_2019-6) Similar to ordinary [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(physics) "Period (physics)"), the reciprocal of rotational frequency is the **rotation period** or **period of rotation**, _T_=_ν_−1=_n_−1, with dimension of time (SI unit [seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seconds "Seconds")).

**Rotational velocity** is the [vector quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_quantity "Vector quantity") whose magnitude equals the [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)") rotational speed. In the special cases of [_spin_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(geometry) "Spin (geometry)") (around an axis internal to the body) and [_revolution_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_(geometry) "Revolution (geometry)") (external axis), the rotation speed may be called _**spin speed**_ and _**revolution speed**_, respectively.

**Rotational acceleration** is the rate of change of rotational velocity; it has dimension of squared reciprocal time and SI units of squared reciprocal seconds (s−2); thus, it is a normalized version of _[angular acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular\_acceleration "Angular acceleration")_ and it is analogous to _[chirpyness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirpyness "Chirpyness")_.

[Tangential speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_speed "Tangential speed")![Image 4: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) (Latin letter [v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V "V")), rotational frequency ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \nu }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c15bbbb971240cf328aba572178f091684585468), and [radial distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system "Polar coordinate system")![Image 6: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538), are related by the following equation:[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_velocity#cite_note-7)![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}v&=2\pi r\nu \\v&=r\omega .\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c486aded240ae8c01e50f9ba395fc0ad87b386e2)

An algebraic rearrangement of this equation allows us to solve for rotational frequency: ![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nu &=v/2\pi r\\\omega &=v/r.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e5729bda5926d7e0eb94dbbb8f3346a07c0a930a)

Thus, the tangential speed will be directly proportional to ![Image 9: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538) when all parts of a system simultaneously have the same ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \omega }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/48eff443f9de7a985bb94ca3bde20813ea737be8), as for a wheel, disk, or rigid wand. The direct proportionality of ![Image 11: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) to ![Image 12: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538) is not valid for the [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"), because the planets have different rotational frequencies.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Regression analysis

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotational_frequency&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Regression analysis")]

Rotational frequency can measure, for example, how fast a motor is running. _Rotational speed_ is sometimes used to mean [angular frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency "Angular frequency") rather than the quantity defined in this article. Angular frequency gives the change in [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") per time unit, which is given with the unit [radian per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian_per_second "Radian per second") in the SI system. Since 2π radians or 360 degrees correspond to a cycle, we can convert angular frequency to rotational frequency by ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \nu =\omega /2\pi ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd94ff37ffa410ab51740a59cff0b5636ef2e62f) where

*   ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \nu \,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/32a13ab64f1a72c7827e70aed42c8fcb323bd7bf) is rotational frequency, with unit cycles per second
*   ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \omega \,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1caedcdf3f920c9e1271a9500bf2621df8a46c0c) is angular frequency, with unit radian per second or degree per second

For example, a [stepper motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor "Stepper motor") might turn exactly one complete revolution each second. Its angular frequency is 360 [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)") per second (360°/s), or 2π [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian") per second (2π rad/s), while the rotational frequency is 60 rpm.

Rotational frequency is not to be confused with [tangential speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed#Tangential_speed "Speed"), despite some relation between the two concepts. Imagine a merry-go-round with a constant rate of rotation. No matter how close to or far from the axis of rotation you stand, your rotational frequency will remain constant. However, your tangential speed does not remain constant. If you stand two meters from the axis of rotation, your tangential speed will be double the amount if you were standing only one meter from the axis of rotation.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_velocity#cite_ref-3 "Jump up")**"The rotational frequency _n_ of a rotating body is defined to be the number of revolutions it makes in a time interval divided by that time interval [4: ISO 80000-3]. The SI unit of this quantity is thus the reciprocal second (s−1). However, as pointed out in Ref. [4: ISO 80000-3], the designations “revolutions per second” (r/s) and “revolutions per minute” (r/min) are widely used as units for rotational frequency in specifications on rotating machinery."[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_velocity#cite_note-NISTGuide_2009-2)
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_velocity#cite_ref-5 "Jump up")**"The SI unit of frequency is hertz, the SI unit of angular velocity and angular frequency is radian per second, and the SI unit of activity is becquerel, implying counts per second. Although it is formally correct to write all three of these units as the reciprocal second, the use of the different names emphasizes the different nature of the quantities concerned. It is especially important to carefully distinguish frequencies from angular frequencies, because by definition their numerical values differ by a factor [see ISO 80000-3 for details] of 2π. Ignoring this fact may cause an error of 2π. Note that in some countries, frequency values are conventionally expressed using “cycle/s” or “cps” instead of the SI unit Hz, although “cycle” and “cps” are not units in the SI. Note also that it is common, although not recommended, to use the term frequency for quantities expressed in rad/s. Because of this, it is recommended that quantities called “frequency”, “angular frequency”, and “angular velocity” always be given explicit units of Hz or rad/s and not s−1."[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_velocity#cite_note-SIBrochure_9-4)
