The binary nature of 243 Ida was discovered when the Galileo spacecraft flew by the asteroid in 1993. Since then numerous binary asteroids and several triple asteroids have been detected.

[ 1 ] The mass ratio of the two components – called the "primary" and "secondary" of a binary system – is an important characteristic. Most binary asteroids have a large mass ratio, i.e. a relatively small satellite in orbit around the main component. Systems with one or more small moons – also called "companions" or simply "satellites" – include 87 Sylvia , 107 Camilla and 45 Eugenia (all triples), 121 Hermione , 130 Elektra (a quadruple), 22 Kalliope , 283 Emma , 379 Huenna , 243 Ida and 4337 Arecibo (in order of decreasing primary size). Some binary systems have a mass ratio near unity, i.e., two components of similar mass. They include 90 Antiope , 2006 VW 139 , 2017 YE 5 and 69230 Hermes , with average component diameters of 86, 1.8, 0.9 and 0.8 km, respectively.

In August 2024 Gaia reported 352 new binary asteroid candidates.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Description [ edit ] Several theories have been posited to explain the formation of binary-asteroid systems. Many systems have significant macro-porosity (a " rubble-pile " interior). The satellites orbiting large main-belt asteroids such as 22 Kalliope, 45 Eugenia or 87 Sylvia may have formed by disruption of a parent body after impact or fission after an oblique impact.

Trans-Neptunian binaries may have formed during the formation of the Solar System by mutual capture or three-body interaction.

Near-Earth asteroids , which orbit in the inner part of the Solar System, most likely form by spin-up and mass shedding, [ 4 ] likely as a result of the YORP effect . Numerical simulations suggest that when solar energy spins a “rubble pile” asteroid to a sufficiently fast rate by the YORP effect, material is thrown from the asteroid's equator.

[ 5 ] This process also exposes fresh material at the poles of the asteroid.
