**United States astronaut badges** are the various [badges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badges "Badges") of the United States which are awarded to [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aviation "Military aviation") and civilian personnel of the [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA"), the various child departments of the [Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defense "Department of Defense"), or a [private space-faring entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_spaceflight "Commercial spaceflight"), who have performed (or in some cases, completed training for) a [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight"). The military versions are among the least-awarded qualification badges of the United States armed forces.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-2)

The first astronaut badges were created by taking the astronauts' own aviator badges and overlaying the center shield with a design called the "astronaut device", a star with three trailing rays passing through an ellipse representing orbital flight.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-:0-3)

In the 1960s, the [United States Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense "United States Department of Defense") awarded astronaut badges to military and civilian pilots who flew aircraft higher than 50 miles (80 kilometres).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-astronaut-4) Seven USAF and NASA pilots qualified for the astronaut badge by flying the [suborbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital_spaceflight "Sub-orbital spaceflight")[X-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_X-15 "North American X-15") rocket spaceplane.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-astronaut-4) American test pilots [Michael Melvill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Melvill "Mike Melvill") and [Brian Binnie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Binnie "Brian Binnie") were each awarded a [commercial astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_astronaut "Commercial astronaut") badge by the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") (FAA) when they flew sub-orbital missions aboard the [Scaled Composites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites "Scaled Composites")[SpaceShipOne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne "SpaceShipOne") rocket spaceplane.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-astronaut-4) All others who have been awarded the astronaut badge earned it travelling to space in non-winged rockets, the [X-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-15 "X-15"), or the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle"). Three of the crew members aboard the Ax-1 flight aboard the Crew Dragon Capsule were awarded their civilian astronaut wings by their Mission commander upon becoming the first private citizens to travel to the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") on April 9, 2022.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-5)

Each of the military services issues its own version of the astronaut badge, which consists of a standard [aviation badge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Aviator_Badge "United States Aviator Badge") with an astronaut device (shooting star through a halo) centered on the badge's shield, or [escutcheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escutcheon_(heraldry) "Escutcheon (heraldry)"). The United States Air Force and United States Army astronaut badges are issued in three degrees: Basic, senior, and command (Air Force)/master (Army). The senior astronaut badge is denoted by a star centered above the decoration, while the command/master level is indicated by a star and wreath.

To earn an astronaut badge, a [U.S. Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Air_Force "U.S. Air Force") or [U.S. Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Navy "U.S. Navy") and [Marine Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USMC "USMC") officer must complete all required training and participate in a space flight more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) above the Earth.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-8) The [U.S. Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Army "U.S. Army") has awarded the badge to officers that have orbited the Earth.

### U.S. Air Force astronauts

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_astronaut_badges&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: U.S. Air Force astronauts")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/USAF_Astronaut_Device.png/250px-USAF_Astronaut_Device.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USAF_Astronaut_Device.png)

The [U.S. Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Air_Force "U.S. Air Force") Astronaut Badge consists of a standard [USAF aeronautical badge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Air_Force_Aeronautical_Ratings "U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Ratings"), either Pilot or Combat Systems Officer (formerly known as Navigator) upon which is centered the astronaut device. The Air Force does not consider Astronaut to be a separate rating from its six established aeronautical rating badges, but as a "qualifier" to them, and may only be awarded by the [Air Force Chief of Staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Chief_of_Staff "Air Force Chief of Staff") after written application upon completion of an operational space mission. The rating of [Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAF_aeronautical_rating#Observer_ratings "USAF aeronautical rating") is used for USAF [Mission Specialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Specialist "Mission Specialist") who have completed training but not a mission and are not otherwise aeronautically rated as a USAF Pilot, RPA Pilot, Combat Systems Officer (formerly Navigator), Air Battle Manager, or Flight Surgeon. These USAF Observers wear wings that are identical to USAF Combat Systems Officers (formerly Navigators) although the Observers have never completed the associated USAF undergraduate flight training to qualify as a Combat Systems Officer or previously as a Navigator. Upon completion of a successful space flight, these Observers will add the "shooting star" logo to their wings, again, identical to those USAF astronauts who are fully qualified as Combat Systems Officers or previously qualified as Navigators.

In 2007, the U.S. Air Force announced the opening of astronaut mission specialists positions to enlisted personnel who met certain eligibility requirements.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-10) These requirements include:

*   Be on active duty in the U.S. Air Force
*   Be a United States citizen
*   Have a minimum of a bachelor's degree in either engineering, mathematics, biological science, or physical science, with 3 years experience
*   Have a current Class II Flight Physical
*   Be between 62 and 75 inches tall

No enlisted astronaut badges are yet known to have been issued.

### U.S. Army astronauts

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_astronaut_badges&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: U.S. Army astronauts")]

The gold astronaut device is issued by the [U.S. Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Army "U.S. Army") to Army aviators, flight surgeons, and aircrew members that qualify as astronauts. Army astronauts that have yet to fly a mission and have not previously been awarded any aviation badge are awarded the [army aviation badge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircrew_Badge "Aircrew Badge"). Once they have flown a mission, they are awarded the astronaut device, which is affixed to the shield of their army aviation badge. The army astronaut device was approved on May 17, 1983. The black version of the device and its sew-on equivalent may be worn on the [Army Combat Uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Combat_Uniform "Army Combat Uniform") (ACU); the silver wings with gold device version is authorized for wear on [Army Service Uniforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Service_Uniform "Army Service Uniform"). It is believed to be the rarest badge issued by the U.S. Army.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-army-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-14)

### U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard astronauts

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_astronaut_badges&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard astronauts")]

The Naval Astronaut insignias are issued in a single degree to [Naval Aviators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Aviator "United States Naval Aviator") and [Naval Flight Officers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Flight_Officer "Naval Flight Officer") from the [United States Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy"), [United States Marine Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps "United States Marine Corps"), and [United States Coast Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard "United States Coast Guard"), with officers of all three branches receiving their designations as Naval Aviators or Naval Flight Officers through the naval aviation flight training program that the U.S. Navy administers for all three service branches. All three branches also wear the same insignia which consists of [naval aviator insignia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_aviator_insignia "Naval aviator insignia") or [naval flight officer insignia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_flight_officer_insignia "Naval flight officer insignia") with a centered gold astronaut device. However, the Coast Guard only issues the Naval Flight Officer version of the astronaut insignia to its astronauts, even though all their astronauts to date have been qualified Naval Aviators. The reason(s) for this disparity have never been clearly articulated but it may stem from the fact that all USCG astronauts to date have flown as Mission Specialists and not as spacecraft pilots. However, USN and USMC Naval Aviators who fly as Mission Specialists are awarded and will wear the Naval Aviator Astronaut insignia. USCG astronauts wear both their Naval Aviator wings and their Coast Guard Astronaut wings on their uniforms.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-15)

### U.S. Space Force astronauts

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_astronaut_badges&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: U.S. Space Force astronauts")]

As of 2025, two USSF officers have qualified as military astronauts.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-17) Both were originally commissioned as USAF officers. Neither one attended USAF flight training to become a Pilot or what was then known as Navigator, now known as Combat Systems Officer, and instead served as technical flight test engineers. Both currently wear the USAF Senior Observer Astronaut insignia identical to the Senior USAF Combat Systems Officer Astronaut insignia.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-18)

### Civilian astronaut badge

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_astronaut_badges&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Civilian astronaut badge")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Civilianastronautwings.jpg/330px-Civilianastronautwings.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Civilianastronautwings.jpg)

NASA Civilian Astronaut Wings

NASA issues an badge to all civilian personnel working as career astronauts on spaceflight missions who are not otherwise Active Duty, Reserve or National Guard, or Retired aeronautically rated (USAF/USA) or aeronautically designated (USN/USMC/USCG) personnel.

The badge is embroidered in silver, and may optionally be embroidered in gold for astronauts who have flown to space. They feature the same astronaut device between the wings as seen on the military versions. It is worn on flight suits and flight jackets.

### Space Shuttle payload specialist badges

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_astronaut_badges&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Space Shuttle payload specialist badges")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Space_Shuttle_payload_specialist_badge.jpg/250px-Space_Shuttle_payload_specialist_badge.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Space_Shuttle_payload_specialist_badge.jpg)

The payload specialist badge of [Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine") astronaut [Leonid Kadenyuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kadenyuk "Leonid Kadenyuk")

A unique badge was created for individuals serving as [payload specialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_specialist "Payload specialist") on NASA Space Shuttle missions. Payload specialists were selected by a variety of organizations and included:

*   individuals selected by the research community, a company or consortium flying a commercial payload aboard the spacecraft
*   non-NASA astronauts selected by partner nations
*   U.S. legislative branch representatives

The payload specialist badge featured a silhouette of the Space Shuttle in place of the astronaut device.

NASA astronaut pins
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_astronaut_badges&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: NASA astronaut pins")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/NASA_Astronaut_Pin.png/120px-NASA_Astronaut_Pin.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NASA_Astronaut_Pin.png)

Gold Grade Astronaut Pin

In addition to the astronaut badge, which is worn on a military uniform or NASA jumpsuit, astronauts also earn a pin to wear on civilian clothing, signifying their eligibility to take part in missions to space. These include flights to the International Space Station, and Artemis missions to the moon.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-:0-3)

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/John_Glenn_in_1960.jpg/250px-John_Glenn_in_1960.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_Glenn_in_1960.jpg)

[John Glenn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glenn "John Glenn") in 1960, wearing his Mercury astronaut pin

The first astronaut pin was created for the [Mercury Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Seven "Mercury Seven") astronauts, in the form of the symbol for the planet Mercury overlaid with the Arabic number "7." As the space program expanded, NASA realized it needed a new symbol to cover personnel on all missions, and created a new lapel pin isolating the "astronaut device" previously applied to flight wings.

The pin is issued in two grades, silver and gold, with the silver pin awarded to candidates who have successfully completed astronaut training and the gold pin to astronauts who have flown in space.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-:0-3) Astronaut candidates are given the silver pin but are required to purchase the gold pin at a cost of approximately $400.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-19) The Mercury astronauts were the first to receive the pins.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-:0-3)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Eisele_donn.jpg/250px-Eisele_donn.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eisele_donn.jpg)

Astronaut [Donn F. Eisele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donn_F._Eisele "Donn F. Eisele") wearing a silver qualification pin before his [Apollo 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_7 "Apollo 7") mission

A unique astronaut pin was made for NASA astronaut [Deke Slayton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deke_Slayton "Deke Slayton") in 1967. It was gold in color, like the ones given to astronauts who had flown, and it had a small diamond in place of the star. It was made at the request of the crew of the first [crewed mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1 "Apollo 1") of the [Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program") as a tribute to Slayton's work at NASA. At the time it was thought that Slayton would never get to space himself, due to a [heart condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation "Atrial fibrillation"). Believing that Slayton would refuse to wear exactly the same gold pin as veteran astronauts, the diamond was added. The pin was supposed to have been flown on board the Apollo 1 [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"), then given to Slayton after the mission was over. However, the Apollo 1 crew died in a fire during a training exercise on January 27, 1967 and the pin was presented to Slayton by the three widows of the dead crew. This diamond-studded gold pin was later flown to the Moon on board [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11") in July 1969.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-s573-20) Slayton would go on to earn a gold pin in 1975 as a docking module pilot on the [Apollo-Soyuz Test Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo-Soyuz_Test_Project "Apollo-Soyuz Test Project").

A second unique pin was made for [Nick Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Hague "Nick Hague") after he became the first NASA astronaut to experience an in-flight [launch abort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_escape_system "Launch escape system"). On October 11, 2018, the [Soyuz MS-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_MS-10 "Soyuz MS-10") mission, part of [Expedition 57](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_57 "Expedition 57") to the International Space Station, aborted after one of the four boosters failed to separate properly from the first stage core. The abort happened late enough in the launch sequence that the Soyuz capsule coasted to an [apogee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee "Apogee") of 93 km (58 mi) after separating from the disintegrating rocket. This was above the U.S. definition of the boundary of space at 50 miles (80 km) but below the [FAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_A%C3%A9ronautique_Internationale "Fédération Aéronautique Internationale") definition of 100 km (62 mi). In commemoration of his aborted flight, he was given a pin made of roughly-cast [tin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin "Tin"). He would later receive a gold pin after his successful mission as part of [Expedition 59](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_59 "Expedition 59")/[60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_60 "Expedition 60").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-21)

One silver astronaut pin currently rests on the surface of the Moon, the one that belonged to [Clifton Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton_Williams "Clifton Williams"), left there by astronaut [Alan Bean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Bean "Alan Bean") during [Apollo 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_12 "Apollo 12") in 1969. Williams was originally scheduled to fly to the Moon as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 12 but was killed in a plane crash before he was officially assigned to the flight. Bean was his replacement.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-22)

FAA Commercial Space Astronaut Wings
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_astronaut_badges&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: FAA Commercial Space Astronaut Wings")]

From 2004 through 2021 the U.S. [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") created a program to encourage and recognize [commercial astronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_astronaut "Commercial astronaut"), giving special wings to pilots and flight crew on all FAA-licensed commercial flight that exceeded 50 [miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_miles "Statute miles") above the surface of the Earth. The FAA Commercial Astronaut Wings design was changed in 2018, and the program opened up to all passengers on such flights.

The program was discontinued in 2021, with the rise of commercial space tourism.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-faaends-23) In total, 30 people were awarded Commercial Space Astronaut Wings.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Astronaut_Badge#cite_note-24)
