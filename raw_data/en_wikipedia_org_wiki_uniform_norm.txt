For example, points (2, 0) , (2, 1) , and (2, 2) lie along the perimeter of a square and belong to the set of vectors whose sup norm is 2.

In mathematical analysis , the uniform norm (or sup norm ) assigns, to real- or complex -valued bounded functions ⁠ f {\displaystyle f} ⁠ defined on a set ⁠ S {\displaystyle S} ⁠ , the non-negative number ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ ∞ ∞ = ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ ∞ ∞ , S = sup { | f ( s ) | : s ∈ ∈ S } .

{\displaystyle \|f\|_{\infty }=\|f\|_{\infty ,S}=\sup \left\{\,|f(s)|:s\in S\,\right\}.} This norm is also called the supremum norm , the Chebyshev norm , the infinity norm , or, when the supremum is in fact the maximum, the max norm .  The name "uniform norm" derives from the fact that a sequence of functions ⁠ { f n } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{n}\right\}} ⁠ converges to ⁠ f {\displaystyle f} ⁠ under the metric derived from the uniform norm if and only if ⁠ f n {\displaystyle f_{n}} ⁠ converges to ⁠ f {\displaystyle f} ⁠ uniformly .

[ 1 ] If ⁠ f {\displaystyle f} ⁠ is a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval , or more generally a compact set, then it is bounded and the supremum in the above definition is attained by the Weierstrass extreme value theorem , so we can replace the supremum by the maximum. In this case, the norm is also called the maximum norm .
In particular, if ⁠ x {\displaystyle x} ⁠ is some vector such that x = ( x 1 , x 2 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle x=\left(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}\right)} in finite dimensional coordinate space , it takes the form: ‖ ‖ x ‖ ‖ ∞ ∞ := max ( | x 1 | , … … , | x n | ) .

{\displaystyle \|x\|_{\infty }:=\max \left(\left|x_{1}\right|,\ldots ,\left|x_{n}\right|\right).} This is called the ℓ ℓ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \ell ^{\infty }} -norm .

Definition [ edit ] Uniform norms are defined, in general, for bounded functions valued in a normed space . Let X {\displaystyle X} be a set and let ( Y , ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ Y ) {\displaystyle (Y,\|\|_{Y})} be a normed space . On the set Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} of functions from X {\displaystyle X} to Y {\displaystyle Y} , there is an extended norm defined by ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ = sup x ∈ ∈ X ‖ ‖ f ( x ) ‖ ‖ Y ∈ ∈ [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ] .

{\displaystyle \|f\|=\sup _{x\in X}\|f(x)\|_{Y}\in [0,\infty ].} This is in general an extended norm since the function f {\displaystyle f} may not be bounded. Restricting this extended norm to the bounded functions (i.e., the functions with finite above extended norm) yields a (finite-valued) norm, called the uniform norm on Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} . Note that the definition of uniform norm does not rely on any additional structure on the set X {\displaystyle X} , although in practice X {\displaystyle X} is often at least a topological space .

The convergence on Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} in the topology induced by the uniform extended norm is the uniform convergence , for sequences, and also for nets and filters on Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} .

We can define closed sets and closures of sets with respect to this metric topology; closed sets in the uniform norm are sometimes called uniformly closed and closures uniform closures . The uniform closure of a set of functions A is the space of all functions that can be approximated by a sequence of uniformly-converging functions on A .

{\displaystyle A.} For instance, one restatement of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem is that the set of all continuous functions on [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} is the uniform closure of the set of polynomials on [ a , b ] .

{\displaystyle [a,b].} For complex continuous functions over a compact space, this turns it into a C* algebra (cf.

Gelfand representation ).

Weaker structures inducing the topology of uniform convergence [ edit ] Uniform metric [ edit ] Main article: Chebyshev distance The uniform metric between two bounded functions f , g : : X → → Y {\displaystyle f,g\colon X\to Y} from a set X {\displaystyle X} to a metric space ( Y , d Y ) {\displaystyle (Y,d_{Y})} is defined by d ( f , g ) = sup x ∈ ∈ X d Y ( f ( x ) , g ( x ) ) {\displaystyle d(f,g)=\sup _{x\in X}d_{Y}(f(x),g(x))} The uniform metric is also called the Chebyshev metric , after Pafnuty Chebyshev , who was first to systematically study it. In this case, f {\displaystyle f} is bounded precisely if d ( f , g ) {\displaystyle d(f,g)} is finite for some constant function g {\displaystyle g} . If we allow unbounded functions, this formula does not yield a norm or metric in a strict sense, although the obtained so-called extended metric still allows one to define a topology on the function space in question; the convergence is then still the uniform convergence . In particular, a sequence { f n : n = 1 , 2 , 3 , … … } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{n}:n=1,2,3,\ldots \right\}} converges uniformly to a function f {\displaystyle f} if and only if lim n → → ∞ ∞ d ( f n , f ) = 0.

{\displaystyle \lim _{n\rightarrow \infty }d(f_{n},f)=0.\,} If ( Y , ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ Y ) {\displaystyle (Y,\|\|_{Y})} is a normed space , then it is a metric space in a natural way. The extended metric on Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} induced by the uniform extended norm is the same as the uniform extended metric d ( f , g ) = sup x ∈ ∈ X ‖ ‖ f ( x ) − − g ( x ) ‖ ‖ Y {\displaystyle d(f,g)=\sup _{x\in X}\|f(x)-g(x)\|_{Y}} on Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} Uniformity of uniform convergence [ edit ] See also: Topologies on spaces of linear maps Let X {\displaystyle X} be a set and let ( Y , E Y ) {\displaystyle (Y,{\mathcal {E}}_{Y})} be a uniform space . A sequence ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} of functions from X {\displaystyle X} to Y {\displaystyle Y} is said to converge uniformly to a function f {\displaystyle f} if for each entourage E ∈ ∈ E Y {\displaystyle E\in {\mathcal {E}}_{Y}} there is a natural number n 0 {\displaystyle n_{0}} such that, ( f n ( x ) , f ( x ) ) {\displaystyle (f_{n}(x),f(x))} belongs to E {\displaystyle E} whenever x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and n ≥ ≥ n 0 {\displaystyle n\geq n_{0}} . Similarly for a net. This is a convergence in a topology on Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} . In fact, the sets { ( f , g ) : : ∀ ∀ x ∈ ∈ X : : ( f ( x ) , g ( x ) ) ∈ ∈ E } {\displaystyle \{(f,g)\colon \forall x\in X\colon (f(x),g(x))\in E\}} where E {\displaystyle E} runs through entourages of Y {\displaystyle Y} form a fundamental system of entourages of a uniformity on Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} , called the uniformity of uniform convergence on Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} . The uniform convergence is precisely the convergence under its uniform topology.

If ( Y , d Y ) {\displaystyle (Y,d_{Y})} is a metric space , then it is by default equipped with the metric uniformity . The metric uniformity on Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} with respect to the uniform extended metric is then the uniformity of uniform convergence on Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} .

Properties [ edit ] The set of vectors whose infinity norm is a given constant, c , {\displaystyle c,} forms the surface of a hypercube with edge length 2 c .

{\displaystyle 2c.} The reason for the subscript “ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } ” is that whenever f {\displaystyle f} is continuous and ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ p < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \Vert f\Vert _{p}<\infty } for some p ∈ ∈ ( 0 , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle p\in (0,\infty )} , then lim p → → ∞ ∞ ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ p = ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ ∞ ∞ , {\displaystyle \lim _{p\to \infty }\|f\|_{p}=\|f\|_{\infty },} where ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ p = ( ∫ ∫ D | f | p d μ μ ) 1 / p {\displaystyle \|f\|_{p}=\left(\int _{D}|f|^{p}\,d\mu \right)^{1/p}} where D {\displaystyle D} is the domain of f {\displaystyle f} ; the integral amounts to a sum if D {\displaystyle D} is a discrete set (see p -norm ).
