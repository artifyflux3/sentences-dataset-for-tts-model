The term, along with its sister idempotent , was introduced by Benjamin Peirce in the context of his work on the classification of algebras.

[ 1 ] Examples [ edit ] This definition can be applied in particular to square matrices . The matrix A = ( 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ) {\displaystyle A={\begin{pmatrix}0&1&0\\0&0&1\\0&0&0\end{pmatrix}}} is nilpotent because A 3 = 0 {\displaystyle A^{3}=0} . See nilpotent matrix for more.

In the factor ring Z / 9 Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /9\mathbb {Z} } , the equivalence class of 3 is nilpotent because 3 2 is congruent to 0 modulo 9.

Assume that two elements a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} in a ring R {\displaystyle R} satisfy a b = 0 {\displaystyle ab=0} . Then the element c = b a {\displaystyle c=ba} is nilpotent as c 2 = ( b a ) 2 = b ( a b ) a = 0.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}c^{2}&=(ba)^{2}\\&=b(ab)a\\&=0.\\\end{aligned}}} An example with matrices (for a , b ): A = ( 0 1 0 1 ) , B = ( 0 1 0 0 ) .

{\displaystyle A={\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\0&1\end{pmatrix}},\;\;B={\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix}}.} Here A B = 0 {\displaystyle AB=0} and B A = B {\displaystyle BA=B} .

By definition, any element of a nilsemigroup is nilpotent.

Properties [ edit ] No nilpotent element can be a unit (except in the trivial ring , which has only a single element 0 = 1 ). All nilpotent elements are zero divisors .

An n × × n {\displaystyle n\times n} matrix A {\displaystyle A} with entries from a field is nilpotent if and only if its characteristic polynomial is t n {\displaystyle t^{n}} .

If x {\displaystyle x} is nilpotent, then 1 − − x {\displaystyle 1-x} is a unit , because x n = 0 {\displaystyle x^{n}=0} entails ( 1 − − x ) ( 1 + x + x 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + x n − − 1 ) = 1 − − x n = 1.

{\displaystyle (1-x)(1+x+x^{2}+\cdots +x^{n-1})=1-x^{n}=1.} More generally, the sum of a unit element and a nilpotent element is a unit when they commute.

Commutative rings [ edit ] The nilpotent elements from a commutative ring R {\displaystyle R} form an ideal N {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {N}}} ; this is a consequence of the binomial theorem . This ideal is the nilradical of the ring. If N = { 0 } {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {N}}=\{0\}} , i.e., R {\displaystyle R} has no non-zero nilpotent elements, R {\displaystyle R} is called a reduced ring .

Every nilpotent element x {\displaystyle x} in a commutative ring is contained in every prime ideal p {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {p}}} of that ring, since x n = 0 ∈ ∈ p {\displaystyle x^{n}=0\in {\mathfrak {p}}} . So N {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {N}}} is contained in the intersection of all prime ideals. Conversely, if x {\displaystyle x} is not nilpotent, we are able to localize with respect to the powers of x {\displaystyle x} : S = { 1 , x , x 2 , .

} {\displaystyle S=\{1,x,x^{2},...\}} to get a non-zero ring S − − 1 R {\displaystyle S^{-1}R} . The prime ideals of the localized ring correspond exactly to those prime ideals p {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {p}}} of R {\displaystyle R} with p ∩ ∩ S = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {p}}\cap S=\emptyset } .

[ 2 ] As every non-zero commutative ring has a maximal ideal , which is prime, every non-nilpotent x {\displaystyle x} is not contained in some prime ideal. Thus N {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {N}}} is exactly the intersection of all prime ideals.

[ 3 ] A characteristic similar to that of Jacobson radical and annihilation of simple modules is available for nilradical: nilpotent elements of a ring R {\displaystyle R} are precisely those that annihilate all integral domains internal to the ring R {\displaystyle R} (that is, of the form R / I {\displaystyle R/I} for prime ideals I {\displaystyle I} ).  This follows from the fact that nilradical is the intersection of all prime ideals.

Nilpotent elements in Lie algebra [ edit ] Let g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} be a Lie algebra . Then an element x ∈ ∈ g {\displaystyle x\in {\mathfrak {g}}} is called nilpotent if it is in the commutator subalgebra [ g , g ] {\displaystyle [{\mathfrak {g}},{\mathfrak {g}}]} and ad ⁡ ⁡ x {\displaystyle \operatorname {ad} x} is a nilpotent transformation. See also: Jordan decomposition in a Lie algebra .

Nilpotency in physics [ edit ] Any ladder operator in a finite dimensional space is nilpotent.  They represent creation and annihilation operators , which transform from one state to another, for example the raising and lowering Pauli matrices σ σ ± ± = ( σ σ x ± ± i σ σ y ) / 2 {\displaystyle \sigma _{\pm }=(\sigma _{x}\pm i\sigma _{y})/2} .

An operand Q {\displaystyle Q} that satisfies Q 2 = 0 {\displaystyle Q^{2}=0} is nilpotent.

Grassmann numbers which allow a path integral representation for Fermionic fields are nilpotents since their squares vanish. The BRST charge is an important example in physics .

As linear operators form an associative algebra and thus a ring, this is a special case of the initial definition.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] More generally, in view of the above definitions, an operator Q {\displaystyle Q} is nilpotent if there is n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} } such that Q n = 0 {\displaystyle Q^{n}=0} (the zero function ). Thus, a linear map is nilpotent iff it has a nilpotent matrix in some basis. Another example for this is the exterior derivative (again with n = 2 {\displaystyle n=2} ). Both are linked, also through supersymmetry and Morse theory , [ 6 ] as shown by Edward Witten in a celebrated article.

[ 7 ] The electromagnetic field of a plane wave without sources is nilpotent when it is expressed in terms of the algebra of physical space .

[ 8 ] More generally, the technique of microadditivity (which can used to derive theorems in physics) makes use of nilpotent or nilsquare infinitesimals and is part smooth infinitesimal analysis .

Algebraic nilpotents [ edit ] The two-dimensional dual numbers contain a nilpotent space. Other algebras and numbers that contain nilpotent spaces include split-quaternions (coquaternions), split-octonions , biquaternions C ⊗ ⊗ H {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} \otimes \mathbb {H} } , and complex octonions C ⊗ ⊗ O {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} \otimes \mathbb {O} } . If a nilpotent infinitesimal is a variable tending to zero, it can be shown that any sum of terms for which it is the subject is an indefinitely small proportion of the first order term.
