The postulate was introduced by Max Planck in his derivation of his law of black body radiation in 1900. This assumption allowed Planck to derive a formula for the entire spectrum of the radiation emitted by a black body. Planck was unable to justify this assumption based on classical physics ; he considered quantization as being purely a mathematical trick, rather than (as is now known) a fundamental change in the understanding of the world.

[ 1 ] In other words, Planck then contemplated virtual oscillators.

In 1905, Albert Einstein adapted the Planck postulate to explain the photoelectric effect , but Einstein proposed that the energy of photons themselves was quantized (with photon energy given by the Planck–Einstein relation ), and that quantization was not merely a feature of microscopic oscillators. Planck's postulate was further applied to understanding the Compton effect , and was applied by Niels Bohr to explain the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom and derive the correct value of the Rydberg constant .
