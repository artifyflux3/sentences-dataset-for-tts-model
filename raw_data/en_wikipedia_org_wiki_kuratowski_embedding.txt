It is named after Kazimierz Kuratowski .

The statement obviously holds for the empty space.
If ( X , d ) is a metric space, x 0 is a point in X ,  and C b ( X ) denotes the Banach space of all bounded continuous real-valued functions on X with the supremum norm , then the map Φ Φ : X → → C b ( X ) {\displaystyle \Phi :X\rightarrow C_{b}(X)} defined by Φ Φ ( x ) ( y ) = d ( x , y ) − − d ( x 0 , y ) for all x , y ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle \Phi (x)(y)=d(x,y)-d(x_{0},y)\quad {\mbox{for all}}\quad x,y\in X} is an isometry .

[ 1 ] The above construction can be seen as embedding a pointed metric space into a Banach space.

The Kuratowski–Wojdysławski theorem states that every bounded metric space X is isometric to a closed subset of a convex subset of some Banach space.

[ 2 ] (N.B. the image of this embedding is closed in the convex subset, not necessarily in the Banach space.) Here we use the isometry Ψ Ψ : X → → C b ( X ) {\displaystyle \Psi :X\rightarrow C_{b}(X)} defined by Ψ Ψ ( x ) ( y ) = d ( x , y ) for all x , y ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle \Psi (x)(y)=d(x,y)\quad {\mbox{for all}}\quad x,y\in X} The convex set mentioned above is the convex hull of Ψ( X ).

In both of these embedding theorems, we may replace C b ( X ) by the Banach space ℓ ∞ ( X ) of all bounded functions X → R , again with the supremum norm, since C b ( X ) is a closed linear subspace of ℓ ∞ ( X ).

These embedding results are useful because Banach spaces have a number of useful properties not shared by all metric spaces: they are vector spaces which allows one to add points and do elementary geometry involving lines and planes etc.; and they are complete . Given a function with codomain X , it is frequently desirable to extend this function to a larger domain, and this often requires simultaneously enlarging the codomain to a Banach space containing X .

History [ edit ] Formally speaking, this embedding was first introduced by Kuratowski , [ 3 ] but a very close variation of this embedding appears already in the papers of Fréchet . Those papers make use of the embedding respectively to exhibit ℓ ℓ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \ell ^{\infty }} as a "universal" separable metric space (it isn't itself separable, hence the scare quotes) [ 4 ] and to construct a general metric on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } by pulling back the metric on a simple Jordan curve in ℓ ℓ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \ell ^{\infty }} .
