Biography [ edit ] Weigel earned his M.A.

(1650) and his habilitation (1652) from the University of Leipzig . From 1653 until his death he was professor of mathematics at Jena University . He was the teacher of Leibniz in summer 1663, [ 2 ] and other notable students. He also worked to make science more widely accessible to the public, and what would today be considered a populariser of science.

He concurred with Jakob Ellrod's "Mittel-Calendar", [ 4 ] and with the advocacy of Leibniz and others, that the date of Easter should be based on the astronomical measurement of the spring equinox and the next full moon . He followed Jakob Ellrod to the Imperial Diet in Regensburg to advocate the use of the Mittel-Calendar or New Gregorian calendar .

[ 3 ] Through Leibniz, Weigel is the intellectual forefather of a long tradition of mathematicians and mathematical physicists that connects a great number of professionals to this day (see Academic genealogy of theoretical physicists: Erhard Weigel). The Mathematics Genealogy Project lists more than 50,000 "descendants" of Weigel's, including Lagrange , Euler , Poisson and several Fields Medalists .

The crater Weigel on the Moon is named after him. In 1999 a colloquium was held in Jena on the 300th anniversary of his death.
