Information geometry is an interdisciplinary field that applies the techniques of differential geometry to study probability theory and statistics .

[ 1 ] It studies statistical manifolds , which are Riemannian manifolds whose points correspond to probability distributions .

( April 2019 ) Historically, information geometry can be traced back to the work of C. R. Rao , who was the first to treat the Fisher matrix as a Riemannian metric .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The modern theory is largely due to Shun'ichi Amari , whose work has been greatly influential on the development of the field.

[ 4 ] Classically, information geometry considered a parametrized statistical model as a Riemannian , conjugate connection, statistical, and dually flat manifolds. Unlike usual smooth manifolds with tensor metric and Levi-Civita connection, these take into account conjugate connection, torsion, and Amari-Chentsov metric.

[ 5 ] All presented above geometric structures find application in information theory and machine learning . For such models, there is a natural choice of Riemannian metric, known as the Fisher information metric . In the special case that the statistical model is an exponential family , it is possible to induce the statistical manifold with a Hessian metric (i.e a Riemannian metric given by the potential of a convex function). In this case, the manifold naturally inherits two flat affine connections , as well as a canonical Bregman divergence . Historically, much of the work was devoted to studying the associated geometry of these examples. In the modern setting, information geometry applies to a much wider context, including non-exponential families, nonparametric statistics , and even abstract statistical manifolds not induced from a known statistical model. The results combine techniques from information theory , affine differential geometry , convex analysis and many other fields. One of the most perspective information geometry approaches find applications in machine learning . For example, the developing of information-geometric optimization methods (mirror descent [ 6 ] and natural gradient descent [ 7 ] ).

The standard references in the field are Shun’ichi Amari and Hiroshi Nagaoka's book, Methods of Information Geometry , [ 8 ] and the more recent book by Nihat Ay and others.

[ 9 ] A gentle introduction is given in the survey by Frank Nielsen.

[ 10 ] In 2018, the journal Information Geometry was released, which is devoted to the field.
