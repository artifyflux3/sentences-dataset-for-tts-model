He is Professor of Philosophy and Intellectual History at Manchester Metropolitan University .

[ 4 ] Recent work [ edit ] Strickland was awarded a Mid-Career Fellowship in 2017 from The British Academy for work on the original manuscript of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz ‚Äôs 1686 Examen religionis Christianae ( Examination of the Christian Religion ).

[ 5 ] Later, the Gerda Henkel Foundation [ de ; cs ; es ] awarded him a Forschungsstipendium (research scholarship); this was to support Strickland‚Äôs work with American computer scientist Harry Lewis in writing Leibniz on Binary: The Invention of Computer Arithmetic , which was published in November 2022.

[ 6 ] Strickland is known for his work on Leibniz, including several volumes of English translations, of which Leibniz on Binary is the latest. It is one of his important contributions to the history of binary and other non-decimal number systems , which include identifying what led Thomas Harriot and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz each to his own independent invention of binary numeration, [ 7 ] [ 8 ] the role of Leibniz‚Äôs invention in the birth of modern computing, and elements in the history of base-16 numeration.

[ 9 ] Strickland has also become known for his work identifying racially-motivated negationism in the formation of the Western philosophical canon [ 10 ] and has called for the recuperative broadening of the Western philosophical curriculum .

[ 11 ] He has also specifically advocated the teaching of African traditional philosophies .

Strickland". The name with the middle initial is that of an American social psychologist who began publishing before the philosopher was born.
