Illuminance [ edit ] To help compare different orders of magnitude , the following list describes various source in lux , which is a lumen per square metre .

[ why?

] The luminance of the sky in particular, varies by location, season, weather, time of day and part of the sky. The sky near the horizon is often about half as bright as at zenith, which in turn is often about half as bright as the sky near the Sun. Dr. Andrew J. Marsh has created an interactive web application that can be used to visualise different sky conditions.
