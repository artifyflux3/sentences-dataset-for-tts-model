Career [ edit ] From 1967 to 1973 Reich was a scientific assistant at the Research Institute of the Deutsches Museum in Munich and the Institute for the History of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich , where in 1973 she graduated under supervision of Helmuth Gericke .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In 1980 she completed her time in Munich, publishing The development of tensor calculus , in 1994 in a revised form as a book.

[ 3 ] In 1980 she became Professor of the History of Natural Science and Engineering at the Stuttgart College of Librarianship .

[ 3 ] In 1980/81 and 1981/82 she had a teaching assignment for the History of Mathematics at the University of Heidelberg . In 1981 she represented the Department of History of Science at the University of Hamburg .

[ 4 ] In 1982, she became associate professor and in 1988 Professor for History of Mathematics at the University of Stuttgart .

[ 1 ] From 1994 until her retirement she was a professor at the Institute for the History of Natural Science, Mathematics and Engineering at the University of Hamburg , where she succeeded Christoph J. Scriba as director.

[ 3 ] Recognition [ edit ] Reich is a corresponding member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities .

[ 4 ] Selected publications [ edit ] Reich's publications include biographies of Carl Friedrich Gauss , Michael Stifel and François Viète .

[ 3 ] With Gericke, Reich produced an annotated translation of Viète's Analyticam In artem Isagoge from 1591.

[ 5 ] She wrote a history of vector-and tensor and differential geometry. With Kurt Vogel , Gericke and Reich reissued Johannes Tropfke 's history of elementary mathematics.

[ 6 ] Reich's books include: Maß, Zahl und Gewicht: Mathematik als Schlüssel zu Weltverständnis und Weltbeherrschung [ Measure, number and weight: Mathematics as key to understanding and mastering the world ] (with Menso Folkerts and Eberhard Knobloch , VCH, Acta Humaniora, Weinheim, 1989) [ 7 ] Die Entwicklung des Tensorkalküls: Vom absoluten Differentialkalkül zur Relativitätstheorie [ The development of tensor calculus: From the absolute differential calculus to relativity theory ] (Birkhäuser, 1994) [ 8 ] Im Umfeld der "Theoria motus": Gauß' Briefwechsel mit Perthes, Laplace, Delambre und Legendre [ On matters having to do with the "Theoria motus": Gauss' correspondence with Perthes, Laplace, Delambre and Legendre ] (Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2001) [ 9 ] Carl Friedrich Gauß und Russland: Sein Briefwechsel mit in Russland wirkenden Wissenschaftlern [ Carl Friedrich Gauss and Russia: His correspondence with scientists working in Russia ] (with Elena Roussanova, De Gruyter, 2012) [ 10 ] Carl Friedrich Gauß und Christopher Hansteen: Der Briefwechsel beider Gelehrten im historischen Kontext [ Carl Friedrich Gauss and Christopher Hansteen:A correspondence between two scholars in historical context ] (with Elena Roussanova, De Gruyter, 2015) [ 11 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b "Prof. Dr. Karin Reich - AcademiaNet" .
