Find sources: "Normal operator" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , especially functional analysis , a normal operator on a complex Hilbert space H {\displaystyle H} is a continuous linear operator N : : H → → H {\displaystyle N\colon H\rightarrow H} that commutes with its Hermitian adjoint N ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle N^{\ast }} , that is: N ∗ ∗ N = N N ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle N^{\ast }N=NN^{\ast }} .

[ 1 ] Normal operators are important because the spectral theorem holds for them. The class of normal operators is well understood. Examples of normal operators are unitary operators : U ∗ ∗ = U − − 1 {\displaystyle U^{\ast }=U^{-1}} Hermitian operators (i.e., self-adjoint operators): N ∗ ∗ = N {\displaystyle N^{\ast }=N} skew-Hermitian operators: N ∗ ∗ = − − N {\displaystyle N^{\ast }=-N} positive operators : N = M ∗ ∗ M {\displaystyle N=M^{\ast }M} for some M {\displaystyle M} (so N is self-adjoint).

A normal matrix is the matrix expression of a normal operator on the Hilbert space C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} .

Properties [ edit ] Normal operators are characterized by the spectral theorem . A compact normal operator (in particular, a normal operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space ) is unitarily diagonalizable .

[ 2 ] Let T {\displaystyle T} be a bounded operator. The following are equivalent.

T {\displaystyle T} is normal.

T ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle T^{\ast }} is normal.

‖ ‖ T x ‖ ‖ = ‖ ‖ T ∗ ∗ x ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|Tx\|=\|T^{\ast }x\|} for all x {\displaystyle x} (use ‖ ‖ T x ‖ ‖ 2 = ⟨ ⟨ T ∗ ∗ T x , x ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ T T ∗ ∗ x , x ⟩ ⟩ = ‖ ‖ T ∗ ∗ x ‖ ‖ 2 {\displaystyle \|Tx\|^{2}=\langle T^{\ast }Tx,x\rangle =\langle TT^{*}x,x\rangle =\|T^{\ast }x\|^{2}} .

The self-adjoint and anti–self adjoint parts of T {\displaystyle T} commute. That is, if T {\displaystyle T} is written as T = T 1 + i T 2 {\displaystyle T=T_{1}+iT_{2}} with T 1 := T + T ∗ ∗ 2 {\displaystyle T_{1}:={\frac {T+T^{*}}{2}}} and i T 2 := T − − T ∗ ∗ 2 , {\displaystyle i\,T_{2}:={\frac {T-T^{*}}{2}},} then T 1 T 2 = T 2 T 1 .

{\displaystyle T_{1}T_{2}=T_{2}T_{1}.} [ note 1 ] If N {\displaystyle N} is a bounded normal operator, then N {\displaystyle N} and N ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle N^{*}} have the same kernel and the same range. Consequently, the range of N {\displaystyle N} is dense if and only if N {\displaystyle N} is injective.

[ clarification needed ] Put in another way, the kernel of a normal operator is the orthogonal complement of its range. It follows that the kernel of the operator N k {\displaystyle N^{k}} coincides with that of N {\displaystyle N} for any k .

{\displaystyle k.} Every generalized eigenvalue of a normal operator is thus genuine.

λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is an eigenvalue of a normal operator N {\displaystyle N} if and only if its complex conjugate λ λ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\lambda }}} is an eigenvalue of N ∗ ∗ .

{\displaystyle N^{*}.} Eigenvectors of a normal operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal, and a normal operator stabilizes the orthogonal complement of each of its eigenspaces.

[ 3 ] This implies the usual spectral theorem: every normal operator on a finite-dimensional space is diagonalizable by a unitary operator. There is also an infinite-dimensional version of the spectral theorem expressed in terms of projection-valued measures . The residual spectrum of a normal operator is empty.

[ 3 ] The product of normal operators that commute is again normal; this is nontrivial, but follows directly from Fuglede's theorem , which states (in a form generalized by Putnam): If N 1 {\displaystyle N_{1}} and N 2 {\displaystyle N_{2}} are normal operators and if A {\displaystyle A} is a bounded linear operator such that N 1 A = A N 2 , {\displaystyle N_{1}A=AN_{2},} then N 1 ∗ ∗ A = A N 2 ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle N_{1}^{*}A=AN_{2}^{*}} .

The operator norm of a normal operator equals its numerical radius [ clarification needed ] and spectral radius .

A normal operator coincides with its Aluthge transform .

Properties in finite-dimensional case [ edit ] If a normal operator T on a finite-dimensional real [ clarification needed ] or complex Hilbert space (inner product space) H stabilizes a subspace V , then it also stabilizes its orthogonal complement V ⊥ . (This statement is trivial in the case where T is self-adjoint.) Proof.

Let P V be the orthogonal projection onto V . Then the orthogonal projection onto V ⊥ is 1 H − P V . The fact that T stabilizes V can be expressed as ( 1 H − P V ) TP V = 0, or TP V = P V TP V . The goal is to show that P V T ( 1 H − P V ) = 0.

Let X = P V T ( 1 H − P V ). Since ( A , B ) ↦ tr( AB* ) is an inner product on the space of endomorphisms of H , it is enough to show that tr( XX* ) = 0. First it is noted that X X ∗ ∗ = P V T ( 1 H − − P V ) 2 T ∗ ∗ P V = P V T ( 1 H − − P V ) T ∗ ∗ P V = P V T T ∗ ∗ P V − − P V T P V T ∗ ∗ P V .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}XX^{*}&=P_{V}T({\boldsymbol {1}}_{H}-P_{V})^{2}T^{*}P_{V}\\&=P_{V}T({\boldsymbol {1}}_{H}-P_{V})T^{*}P_{V}\\&=P_{V}TT^{*}P_{V}-P_{V}TP_{V}T^{*}P_{V}.\end{aligned}}} Now using properties of the trace and of orthogonal projections we have: tr ⁡ ⁡ ( X X ∗ ∗ ) = tr ⁡ ⁡ ( P V T T ∗ ∗ P V − − P V T P V T ∗ ∗ P V ) = tr ⁡ ⁡ ( P V T T ∗ ∗ P V ) − − tr ⁡ ⁡ ( P V T P V T ∗ ∗ P V ) = tr ⁡ ⁡ ( P V 2 T T ∗ ∗ ) − − tr ⁡ ⁡ ( P V 2 T P V T ∗ ∗ ) = tr ⁡ ⁡ ( P V T T ∗ ∗ ) − − tr ⁡ ⁡ ( P V T P V T ∗ ∗ ) = tr ⁡ ⁡ ( P V T T ∗ ∗ ) − − tr ⁡ ⁡ ( T P V T ∗ ∗ ) using the hypothesis that T stabilizes V = tr ⁡ ⁡ ( P V T T ∗ ∗ ) − − tr ⁡ ⁡ ( P V T ∗ ∗ T ) = tr ⁡ ⁡ ( P V ( T T ∗ ∗ − − T ∗ ∗ T ) ) = 0.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\operatorname {tr} (XX^{*})&=\operatorname {tr} \left(P_{V}TT^{*}P_{V}-P_{V}TP_{V}T^{*}P_{V}\right)\\&=\operatorname {tr} (P_{V}TT^{*}P_{V})-\operatorname {tr} (P_{V}TP_{V}T^{*}P_{V})\\&=\operatorname {tr} (P_{V}^{2}TT^{*})-\operatorname {tr} (P_{V}^{2}TP_{V}T^{*})\\&=\operatorname {tr} (P_{V}TT^{*})-\operatorname {tr} (P_{V}TP_{V}T^{*})\\&=\operatorname {tr} (P_{V}TT^{*})-\operatorname {tr} (TP_{V}T^{*})&&{\text{using the hypothesis that }}T{\text{ stabilizes }}V\\&=\operatorname {tr} (P_{V}TT^{*})-\operatorname {tr} (P_{V}T^{*}T)\\&=\operatorname {tr} (P_{V}(TT^{*}-T^{*}T))\\&=0.\end{aligned}}} The same argument goes through for compact normal operators in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, where one make use of the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product , defined by tr( AB* ) suitably interpreted.

[ 4 ] However, for bounded normal operators, the orthogonal complement to a stable subspace may not be stable.

[ 5 ] It follows that the Hilbert space cannot in general be spanned by eigenvectors of a normal operator. Consider, for example, the bilateral shift (or two-sided shift) acting on ℓ ℓ 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle \ell ^{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} , which is normal, but has no eigenvalues.

The invariant subspaces of a shift acting on Hardy space are characterized by Beurling's theorem .

Normal elements of algebras [ edit ] The notion of normal operators generalizes to an involutive algebra: An element x {\displaystyle x} of an involutive algebra is said to be normal if x ∗ ∗ x = x x ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle x^{\ast }x=xx^{\ast }} .

Self-adjoint and unitary elements are normal.

The most important case is when such an algebra is a C*-algebra .

Unbounded normal operators [ edit ] The definition of normal operators naturally generalizes to some class of unbounded operators. Explicitly, a closed operator N is said to be normal if N ∗ ∗ N = N N ∗ ∗ .

{\displaystyle N^{*}N=NN^{*}.} Here, the existence of the adjoint N* requires that the domain of N be dense, and the equality includes the assertion that the domain of N*N equals that of NN* , which is not necessarily the case in general.

Equivalently normal operators are precisely those for which [ 6 ] ‖ ‖ N x ‖ ‖ = ‖ ‖ N ∗ ∗ x ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|Nx\|=\|N^{*}x\|\qquad } with D ( N ) = D ( N ∗ ∗ ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}(N)={\mathcal {D}}(N^{*}).} The spectral theorem still holds for unbounded (normal) operators. The proofs work by reduction to bounded (normal) operators.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Generalization [ edit ] The success of the theory of normal operators led to several attempts for generalization by weakening the commutativity requirement.
